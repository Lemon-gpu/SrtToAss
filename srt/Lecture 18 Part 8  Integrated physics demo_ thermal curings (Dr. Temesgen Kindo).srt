1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,880
Yeah, right? You will basically get something like a singularity, right?

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:15,760
All right, is it clear so far? So these are the kind of things you will be thinking when you are

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:24,000
adding this. So the final item example I want to talk here is, it's in the blog so you can read

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,200
that for more details I'll show you, but thermal curing. So in thermal curing what you have is

5
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:37,080
these two equations. Now the first one is a heat transfer equation where you have a source term

6
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:47,220
coming from the curing process if alpha is the curing rate. So then in the second one you have

7
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:53,940
just an equation for the curing rate. So this is a heat transfer equation, and I'll give you a

8
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:53,980
little bit of a summary of this. So this is a heat transfer equation. So this is a heat transfer

9
00:00:53,980 --> 00:01:00,280
equation. This is the Arrhenius equation. A lot of chemical kinetics kind of problems take that

10
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:08,880
form. Now the first question is what interfaces are we going to use to solve this? Normally you

11
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,880
would use the heat transfer interface for the first equation since we have already implemented

12
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:19,160
that. But assume you are going to use equation-based modeling entirely. What would you use

13
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,740
for the first one? What interface would you use?

14
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:31,440
Any of the PDE interfaces would work, right? Let's say coefficient-borne PDE. How about the second equation?

15
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:42,240
The ODE interface, right? Because there is no special derivative there. So if you don't have special

16
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,900
derivatives you have to use the ODE interfaces. But we have two ODE interfaces. Domain ODE and Global ODE.

17
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,060
Which one should you use?

18
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:50,700
The domain ODE.

19
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,200
The domain ODE.

20
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:51,700
The domain ODE.

21
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,100
The domain ODE.

22
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:52,600
The domain ODE.

23
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:52,680
The domain ODE.

24
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:52,720
The domain ODE.

25
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:53,680
The domain ODE.

26
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:53,960
The domain ODE.

27
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,000
Domain? Global? Which one?

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,880
.

29
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,840
Why would you say domain ODE?

30
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,920
Because alpha can be a functional spatial.

31
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:12,480
Why can alpha be a function of space? In that equation, in the second equation, is there anything that

32
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,480
would make alpha a function of space?

33
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,720
Initial value.

34
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:22,680
Let's say, okay, let's say, that's a good way. Let's say initial values are fixed. Let's say that value A is

35
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:31,440
fixed, EA is fixed, all parameters in that equation are fixed. Is it still a domain

36
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:41,740
or a global ODE? Are you sure? T is a function, it's coupled right? So on its own yes it

37
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:46,740
would it was almost a global ODE, a domain ODE if everything was constant

38
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:51,620
but we are coupling this to temperature and the temperature is a PDE which can

39
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,700
have different solutions so the fact that the temperature is affecting the

40
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:03,800
curing rate would necessarily we use the domain ODE feature. Is it clear? So if we

41
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:12,180
are doing that here you can add this will also revisit the coupling. How do

42
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,660
you now couple because there is a coupling term right? Here in the

43
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:21,300
coefficient form we just specify in this equation EA these are the diffusion

44
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:21,500
coefficients.

45
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:27,940
from the first equation, no source terms originally or we can write the source

46
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:34,500
term here. There is a source term right that there is this term but the way to

47
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,920
add that then is to your coefficient form or EA you can add a

48
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,780
source term if you right click this and say source and that source term you see

49
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:49,280
this declaration d alpha t make it a function of the other variable now you

50
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,500
have coupled it and then in the second domain ODE, you can add this to the coefficient form.

51
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,620
So if you have coupled this to the coefficient form and then in the third

52
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:58,460
domain ODE then this source term that you have to type make it a function of

53
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:09,860
temperature. So now you have coupled both. Is it clear? Questions? So then I

54
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:15,780
will skip through this verification and validation and give you the homework.
