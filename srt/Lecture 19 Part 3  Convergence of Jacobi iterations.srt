1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
If u0 is equal to u, it's still going to be u, exactly.

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:12,820
This is because we just wrote the equation without the superscripts, right?

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:19,080
Without the superscript, the equation is exactly satisfied by the solution to the linear equations.

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:27,420
So if u0 is already u, then the left-hand side is u1.

5
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,580
And u1 has to be also u in order for this equation to be satisfied.

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:38,240
Well, unless d is degenerate, unless d has zero entries, it's a diagonal matrix, right?

7
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:43,920
So if all the diagonal parts are non-zero, then u1 can only be u.

8
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,820
And therefore, if u1 is equal to u, u2 also has to be u.

9
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,660
If u2 has to be u, u3 also has to be u, etc.

10
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:56,580
So if you start it with the right solution, you'll always end up with the right solution.

11
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,520
Of course, that's a big assumption, right?

12
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,260
So you almost never start with the right solution.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,120
So what do you get?

14
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,760
What do you get if you don't have the right solution to start with?

15
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,460
So let's define.

16
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,640
Let's look at now the error equation.

17
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,280
So the error equation is looking at,

18
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:26,220
so if I define solution error ek to be the difference between the solution I have minus the real solution,

19
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:35,380
well, in practice, I never know what ek is because I don't know the true solution.

20
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:42,060
But if I can derive a governing equation for the evolution of ek,

21
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,880
we can analyze is the solution error becoming smaller and smaller or becoming larger and larger as I iterate.

22
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:56,880
And we want to construct the method or derive conditions for the method so that ek is going to,

23
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,020
you know,

24
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:57,080
you know,

25
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,140
you know,

26
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:57,400
you know,

27
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:57,420
you know,

28
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,480
decreasing as I increase k.

29
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,440
So how do we derive the equation for ek?

30
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,700
We subtract this equation with the superscript.

31
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,820
We subtract the equation without a superscript from the equation with the superscript.

32
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:24,100
By doing this, the left-hand side would be du k plus 1 minus du.

33
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,400
The right-hand side would be b,

34
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,520
minus l,

35
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:28,960
u,

36
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,580
k,

37
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,620
minus u,

38
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,020
u,

39
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:31,520
k,

40
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,520
minus b,

41
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,220
minus l,

42
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:36,760
u,

43
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,600
minus u,

44
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,100
u.

45
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,200
Right?

46
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,360
This is just subtracting two equalities.

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,520
Both are true.

48
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,720
And simply by linearity and the definition of ek,

49
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,920
the left-hand side becomes d of ek plus 1.

50
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,640
And the right-hand side,

51
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,380
the b,

52
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,180
fortunately,

53
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:58,780
cancels.

54
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:05,480
What we are left with is l plus u,

55
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,100
and I think we have a minus sign here,

56
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,380
times ek.

57
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:16,580
So the last thing we want to do is further simplify this by multiplying a d inverse.

58
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:22,780
Remember, the method only works if d has non-zero diagonals.

59
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,500
So let's multiply a d inverse on both equations,

60
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:26,980
both equations.

61
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:31,480
So the left-hand side becomes ek plus 1,

62
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:37,780
the right-hand side becomes minus d inverse times l plus u times ek.

63
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,420
Good here?

64
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:47,580
So we can start analyzing whether the ek would increase or decrease over time.

65
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:53,660
What determines if ek is going to increase or decrease over time?

66
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:54,780
The eigenvalue.

67
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:55,780
Yes, the eigenvalue.

68
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,180
Right.

69
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:56,780
So the eigenvalue is going to be the eigenvalue of the equation.

70
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,680
The eigenvalue of this matrix.

71
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,940
This matrix is so important it has a name.

72
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:06,480
It's called the iteration matrix.

73
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:14,960
So this matrix determines, actually, the stability of this matrix determines if the ek is going

74
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,980
to increase over time or decrease over time.

75
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,180
Okay.

76
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:26,700
So because if this matrix, if the iteration matrix, well, the iteration matrix of Jacobi

77
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:36,240
iteration or Jacobi iteration matrix can be expressed as eigenvalue recomposition v times

78
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:46,480
lambda times the inverse, okay, then if we can say E zero, our initial error, which of

79
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:55,380
course we don't know, can be expressed as a summation of a times vi where vi

80
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,500
is a operated function.

81
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,980
v i is the columns of the matrix v.

82
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:09,060
Okay, the same expression can be written as the matrix v times a vector a,

83
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,260
so a1, et cetera, to an.

84
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:18,080
Right, so this is a, so if the iteration matrix is,

85
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:24,500
has a full set of eigenvalues, we can basically write it like that, right?

86
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:35,180
Write any vector to be v times a vector corresponding to the linear combination of the eigenvectors that gives you that vector.

87
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:35,940
Yes?

88
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,240
Why isn't that the lambda?

89
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,240
Shouldn't that be the lambda matrix?

90
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,300
Aren't we, like, decoupling?

91
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,360
Why is it lambda here?

92
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:52,440
Why not?

93
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:53,320
Here?

94
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,280
Which equation are you looking at?

95
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,240
Sorry, yeah, right there.

96
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:05,700
Okay, yeah, this is, we are just trying to express the initial error in our initial guess

97
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,460
as a linear combination of the columns in v.

98
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,380
Yeah, sorry, I didn't think of that.

99
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:23,760
Right, so if we can do that, then e1 is going to be v times lambda times v inverse times e0.

100
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,000
Right?

101
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:32,900
Which, by this expression, is v times lambda times v inverse times v times this vector a.

102
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:34,960
Right?

103
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:39,120
Okay, and this v inverse and v cancels.

104
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:47,340
So we get v times lambda times vector a.

105
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,860
We can keep going.

106
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:54,420
Okay, now, instead of v times a,

107
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,260
we can keep going.

108
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,360
Okay, so e1 is going to be v times lambda times a.

109
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,080
We can do the same trick again.

110
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,940
e2 would be equal to going through the same thing.

111
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:08,200
We would have v lambda v inverse times v lambda a.

112
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,780
And again, this cancels.

113
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:14,200
We get a v times lambda square times a.

114
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,020
And we can keep going, right?

115
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:24,480
So, e to the kth index would be v times lambda to the kth power.

116
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:32,380
times a. So as long as the diagonal entries of lambdas are all less than 1,

117
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:41,020
right, or if it's complex, its magnitude has to be less than 1, and then

118
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:48,200
this ek would ultimately diminish to 0. We would be happy that we have a

119
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:55,040
convergent iterative method which means ek is going to go to 0, and what

120
00:07:55,040 --> 00:08:01,320
does ek goes to 0 mean? my uk is going to converge to u.

121
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:07,420
So although I don't know what u is, I mean when k is sufficiently large, I have

122
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:17,940
a sufficiently accurate approximation to you. Alright, and also

123
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:26,060
here we are lucky that we can check how well we are converging because we also

124
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:33,320
have the residual that is we can check conversions by looking at the residual

125
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:45,200
K equal to B minus a UK so this should be zero if UK is already you right so

126
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:57,860
this is a good criterion for convergence and by the way the convergence here is

127
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:02,360
different from the convergence of a numerical method of a finite difference

128
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:07,580
discretization or a finite element discretization when we talk about

129
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:12,460
convergence in finite difference we are thinking oh okay so let's decrease our

130
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:15,020
grid size by a factor of two

131
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:21,700
should my numerical solution approach the analytical solution right so that is

132
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:27,320
the kind of convergence we are talking about in finite difference or finite

133
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:31,820
element or finite volume but here convergence has a different meaning

134
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:36,220
although we all use the word convergence it actually means different things

135
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:44,300
convergence here means the convergence of the kth iteration to the discrete

136
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:44,820
solution

137
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:52,980
of a PD right so so the because a u equal to B is already a discretized

138
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:59,420
differential equation so even if I get the exact u here the u would be a

139
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:06,360
discrete solution and this UK is an approximation to the discrete solution

140
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:13,780
we are talking about how does UK converge to the discrete solution here

141
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,300
well that makes sense so that's the first thing we are talking about here

142
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:21,500
well that means when you solve the equation using intuitive methods you are

143
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:26,540
making two approximations here one approximation is of of course the

144
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:32,060
discretization of the PDE the numerical solution only approximate the analytical

145
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:38,100
solution up to an approximation error and the second is that you are that of

146
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,000
course both involves spatial discretization and time discretization if

147
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,160
you have time so so remember you can go to the internet and you can go to the

148
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:44,280
computer and you can go to the computer and you can go to the computer and you

149
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:48,680
have the spatial terms also you have time derivative squarization terms and

150
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,340
now if you have space and time squarization you count that as two

151
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:58,280
sources of errors now this is a third source of error that is when K is not

152
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:06,280
sufficiently large you not even have an exact solution to the discrete equations

153
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:14,780
right you can estimate how much error you have by looking at the residual but

154
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:19,820
then remember that's a another source of approximation another source of error

155
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,160
here
