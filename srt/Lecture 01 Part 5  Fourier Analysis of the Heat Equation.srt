1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,720
So we have the parabolic equation which is partial u partial t is equal to kappa

2
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:15,440
of partial square u partial x squared. We are going to analyze this equation

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:23,220
analytically using what's called Fourier analysis. Fourier analysis is a very

4
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,840
powerful tool in studying differential equations especially when you have

5
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:34,020
periodic boundary condition and when you have non periodic boundary condition the

6
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:40,460
qualitative result of what you get in Fourier analysis is very likely to

7
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:48,220
translate into the non periodic boundary condition. So the Fourier analysis is

8
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:54,960
expanding the u which is a function of x so u is the solution to the partial

9
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,820
differential equation. Kappa is a constant

10
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:11,380
and we are thinking of a spatial domain of 0 and 2 pi. Okay so if we have such a

11
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:19,920
domain and if the u is periodic which means it ends exactly where it begins

12
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:27,460
then I can expand ux as a summation of u hat of k

13
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:39,080
times a sinusoidal wave which I can write as exponential of ikx and this case

14
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:44,140
was summed over from minus infinity to infinity.

15
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:55,920
mhm k is an integer exactly k th�� summed over r possible

16
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,540
integers.

17
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:56,700
And e to the iала is less than initial iba. Okay ut drip is less than initialorship.

18
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,280
From there, misma is holds for e into pol.

19
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:57,780
You are supposed to just solve this.

20
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,380
What does it look like?

21
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:05,200
What does e to the i k x look like?

22
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:12,220
E to the i k x looks like a cosine of k x plus an imaginary part of sine k x.

23
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:20,780
Okay, so this u hat of k is a complex number that has imaginary and real parts.

24
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:29,900
And if the u hat of k is exactly the conjugate of u hat of minus k, then the imaginary part

25
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:36,840
cancels and you have perfect sines and cosines added up together to form a solution u as

26
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:42,020
a function of x.

27
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:49,600
The reason we introduce Fourier series, one is because any periodic function can be written

28
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,600
in such a way.

29
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,780
Okay.

30
00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:02,760
And two is that when we're looking at partial differential equations, we have spatial derivatives.

31
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:09,620
And spatial derivatives work very, very nicely with Fourier series.

32
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:17,940
So for example, when we look at this case, what is the first order derivative of this

33
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,940
u?

34
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:20,580
Okay.

35
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:30,140
When we take the first order derivatives, of course, the derivative commutes with this

36
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,220
summation.

37
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,100
And u hat of k is just a number.

38
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,960
It doesn't depend on x.

39
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,020
So u hat of k is also here.

40
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:44,760
And we only have the derivative of e to the i k x dx.

41
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,960
Okay.

42
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,960
Okay.

43
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,960
Okay.

44
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,960
Okay.

45
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,960
Okay.

46
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,960
Okay.

47
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,960
Okay.

48
00:03:51,960 --> 00:04:01,600
So if you take that derivative, it becomes i k times e to the i k x.

49
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:12,040
So taking derivative to a Fourier series is like multiplying i k to each of the u hat

50
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,220
k's in the expansion using Fourier series.

51
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,320
Okay.

52
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,320
Okay.

53
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,320
Okay.

54
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,320
So this gives us our sponsors, right?

55
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,320
So that's the original n i?

56
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,320
So, there is no同 advertial.

57
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,320
There is no half- intentar introversion.

58
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,320
But I now invite you to remember what I said in the earlier part, basically manipulating

59
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,320
this sorrows disgusting way slightly.

60
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:41,320
So we empresas, hopefully to be able to reduce yourhi

61
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,320
Honda.

62
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,320
So say tllo sisters.

63
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,320
Tell me, how do you calculate the imaginary verb on e?

64
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,320
Well, can you gist this is to say級 n?

65
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,320
So if you can get the h with the t part, and i had u, and we get the k hat, we朔

66
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,320
tell it to ją with u k hat of i, k-je хоть, and things pure dbut.

67
00:04:48,320 --> 00:05:04,680
I k squared times e to the, times e to the I k x.

68
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,460
And what is I k square?

69
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:14,660
I k square is minus k square because I square is minus 1.

70
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:18,800
Minus k square, u hat of k, u to the I k x.

71
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,500
Third derivative, multiply by I k again.

72
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,720
Fourth derivative, multiply by I k again.

73
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,420
Right?

74
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,540
So good.

75
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:38,020
Now, this is only looking at a function of only space.

76
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,680
When we are talking about the solution to this partial differential equation,

77
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,640
u is a function of not only x,

78
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,800
but also what?

79
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,620
But also t.

80
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:49,020
Right.

81
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:53,400
And when u is a function of x and t,

82
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,840
this is even nicer.

83
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:59,440
So if you take the derivative of x and t,

84
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,600
oh, let's not take the derivative yet.

85
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:06,560
Let's look at if I expand a function of u and t into Fourier series,

86
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,500
only in x,

87
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,200
what do I get?

88
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,160
What becomes different?

89
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,500
In the expansion.

90
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:15,520
In the expansion.

91
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:26,940
u hat becomes a function of time, exactly.

92
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,560
This is like expanding,

93
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,060
this is like looking at a function u of x and t

94
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:37,640
as functions of x at different t.

95
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:38,520
Right?

96
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,600
For each t, I look at u x of t as a function of x.

97
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,900
And I expand.

98
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,160
That function of x using Fourier series.

99
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:52,580
As a result, the u hat of k is going to be different for every slice of t.

100
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:56,220
That means u hat is going to be a function of t.

101
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:07,660
And this is a separation of variable because now the second derivative of x becomes a summation.

102
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:11,460
Still, k goes from minus infinity to t infinity.

103
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,100
Minus k squared is still the same.

104
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:18,660
u hat of k as a function of t e to the ikx.

105
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:26,580
I can do this because u hat of k is a function of t but not x.

106
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:32,540
So all the spatial derivatives goes right through u hat of t and into the exponentials.

107
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:40,940
And this formula is great, especially when combined with,

108
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,260
when substituted into the differential equation.

109
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,280
Let's do that.

110
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,660
Oops.

111
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:55,980
So let's substitute the Fourier series into this differential equation.

112
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:01,580
Kappa is still here.

113
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:05,780
K goes from minus infinity to infinity.

114
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:10,940
Minus k squared.

115
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,580
u hat of k e to the ikx.

116
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,580
So that's the differential equation.

117
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,580
So this looks normal.

118
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:26,580
But we should also realize that du dt can also be expanded using Fourier series.

119
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,580
So let's write it over here.

120
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:36,820
That is a summation of k goes to minus infinity to infinity of, now, when you're taking the

121
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:41,200
Fourier series, a time derivative.

122
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,580
The e to the ikx is not a function of time.

123
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,580
The only function of time is the u hats.

124
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,580
So we have the time derivative of the u hat times e to the ikx.

125
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:50,580
When you have two sides of an equality, right, two sides of equality, both represented using

126
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:55,580
Fourier series, you know that the coefficients has to match.

127
00:08:55,580 --> 00:09:02,580
So the two sides of an equality, right, both represented using Fourier series, you know

128
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,580
that the coefficients has to match.

129
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:11,580
So if you're going to do a derivative, you have to write the derivative of your derivative

130
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,580
as the e to the ikx.

131
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:19,900
has to match. This is because if you study Fourier series analysis you know

132
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:24,340
that you can multiply both sides of the equation with e to the ikx and

133
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:29,620
integrate and you are going to isolate only one of the terms because the inner

134
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:34,900
product of e to the ikx with the ik prime x is going to be zero if k is not

135
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:41,200
equal to k prime. So you can isolate the terms from each other and say that so

136
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:53,500
so the partial derivative of u hat of k, and by the way this is I

137
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,640
shouldn't write this as a partial derivative anymore because u hat is only

138
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:07,440
a function of t, this should be a du hat dt, right? Partial derivative operates

139
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,960
only on functions of two variables. So this is

140
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,060
d.

141
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:17,160
du hat dt has to equal to minus k square u hat of k.

142
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,700
Does this equation ring a bell with you?

143
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,060
Yes, thank you.

144
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,300
I missed a larger kappa.

145
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:40,540
Should be minus a kappa times k square u hat k.

146
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,640
Thank you.

147
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:52,300
So up to this point, we get no longer a partial differential equation, but a what?

148
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,140
OD, ordinary differential equation.

149
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,360
And do you know what is the solution to this ordinary differential equation?

150
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,220
It's an exponential function, exactly.

151
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:11,180
So u hat of k as a function of t is equal to u hat of k at time 0.

152
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:18,760
Whatever it is, times exponential of minus kappa k square t, right?

153
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,560
The behavior of this function, let me go back.

154
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:35,740
The behavior of this function is going to be like that.

155
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,840
So for small k, when k is equal to 0.

156
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,840
What does the function look like?

157
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:45,880
It's constant.

158
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,580
So k equal to 0 means constant term.

159
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,920
So e to the i 0 x, which means that term doesn't depend on x.

160
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,140
It's a constant in space.

161
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:02,960
So a constant in space term in the Fourier series doesn't change with time.

162
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:07,260
Come on.

163
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,280
Okay.

164
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,000
So you can do this.

165
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,400
You can do this.

166
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,360
So you can do this.

167
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,120
You can do this.

168
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,300
Now, let's look at a small k.

169
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:26,540
So for small k, it's the exponential decay, because minus kappa k square is always negative.

170
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:32,240
Small k is a slow exponential decay.

171
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,020
And for the larger case, for the larger case,

172
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:43,140
it can be a very steep exponential decay.

173
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:55,300
So the solution to this differential equation

174
00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:00,100
is a decay to a constant.

175
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:04,060
Because at the end, as t goes to infinity, so this is t.

176
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:10,180
As t goes to infinity, all the terms become zero

177
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,820
except for the k equal to zero term.
