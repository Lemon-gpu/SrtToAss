1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,300
This is a very recent example from last year. How many of you have heard about

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:13,760
the news that human beings have for the first time detected gravitational waves?

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:20,820
So most of you have. And how many of you knows that numerical solution of partial

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:28,520
differential equations has contributed greatly to the discovery? Only a few

5
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:34,760
people. Let me tell you how this become the case. So if you look at the left-hand

6
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:41,480
side of this slide, you're gonna see the kind of signal detected on the two

7
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:48,520
observatories across the country. And the puzzle is of course how did the

8
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:54,740
physicists know that these kind of signals corresponds to the merger of two

9
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,500
black holes? Einstein has done a lot of research on this. He has done a lot of research on the

10
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:05,580
nonlinear equations. He has derived the equations almost a century ago. And it

11
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:11,580
turns out these equations are remarkably difficult to solve analytically, except

12
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:17,880
for very restricted, very simplified cases. And it turns out the merger of two

13
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:26,520
black holes has to be solved using numerical techniques. So people have to

14
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,500
put Einstein's field equation, which is a partial differential equation, a nonlinear

15
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,880
equation, and a partial differential equation. Discretize it using numerical methods, put

16
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:40,280
it on the supercomputer, and crank it for days or weeks to get the kind of signal

17
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:46,780
that could be emitted by the merger of two black holes. This is amazing to me

18
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:53,460
because when people are simulating this, they didn't even know this actually

19
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,500
existed. That was before the observation. That's

20
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:07,740
just in some cases, in some sense, a prediction by purely physical and mathematical and numerical

21
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:18,520
deduction. And then last year, people actually detected a wave that corresponds exactly

22
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,580
to the kind of signal that was predicted by the numerical solution of partial differential

23
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:28,500
equations. So this is, to me, is a very motivational example in science.

24
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:38,760
And I just want you to know it's really very useful, mainly for real life science.

25
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,480
Especially, for the kind of work that we can do today.

26
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,940
It's a pretty sophisticated machine, but not always.

27
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:52,880
So we'll come back to the actual problem of waterahlen technology, in the following

28
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,880
minutes.

29
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,960
And the end result is significant.

30
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,680
The contrast between these sufferings in an earthquake and an spaceship.

31
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,420
Is

32
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:05,960
It's also a brand new engine. If you zoom into the engine, the engine itself is a very complex machinery.

33
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,900
And

34
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:12,000
if you even zoom into the first stage of

35
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,820
the turbine, which is

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,320
directly after the combustion chamber that burns the fuel at very high temperatures, the turbine itself,

37
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:27,440
if you look at just the components by itself, it's a very complex machinery by itself.

38
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:34,140
And the question is how do engineers actually design this type of machineries,

39
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:42,300
given that they can't really see how it operates because it's inside the turbine, the temperature is so high that

40
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:48,680
the flow can basically melt any metal you can conceive of putting into there.

41
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:54,140
So it's very difficult to measure anything inside there. Of course, you can't see anything inside there.

42
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,740
How do people design these kind of things?

43
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:04,700
People design these kind of machineries by numerically solving partial differential equations.

44
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:10,580
For example, if you just zoom into the trailing edge of the turbine blade,

45
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,720
which is a small part of the whole engine, which is a small part of the whole airplane,

46
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,940
the simulation looks like that.

47
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,360
So this is a solution of

48
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:28,400
partial differential equation that governs the fluid flow of the hot gas going through the trailing edge of the turbine.

49
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,740
And the solution is to measure the temperature of the turbine.

50
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:37,900
And through that, people can predict how much heat is going into the turbine from the blade.

51
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,940
And people can predict what is the maximum temperature on the blade,

52
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:50,020
and whether the blade can sustain that kind of temperature under the given stress, which is also simulated numerically.

53
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,800
And they can predict, is this design good enough?

54
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,160
Is this design going to have a sufficiently long life?

55
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,420
That you can put it in the blade?

56
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:06,240
Or is the local temperature too high so that I have to redesign the blade

57
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:14,480
so that the temperature can be lower and can sustain this type of stress and heat for longer time?

58
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,420
And this kind of situation also happens a lot, I'm sure, in nuclear engineering.

59
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:27,240
Because the amount of power you can generate in nuclear reactor is really

60
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:34,060
determined by how much heat you can carry from the nuclear reaction

61
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:38,240
to the outside and do some mechanical work.

62
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,600
And

63
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,660
in the engineering field, this is news also from about a year ago.

64
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:54,660
President Obama issued the executive order establishing the so-called National Strategic Computing Initiative

65
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,400
to ensure that the U.S. continues leading

66
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,420
in the field over the coming decades.

67
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:11,640
And the executive order basically mandates that the U.S. is going to develop larger computers,

68
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,640
better computing technologies.

69
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:21,560
And the motivation for that is the kind of computational fluid dynamics simulations.

70
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:27,540
And they know it has been an important tool in aircraft design since the 1980s.

71
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:34,420
But it's also limited by the amount of computing power we have.

72
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:43,220
And in order to be able to design better engineering products, we need bigger computers,

73
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:48,180
better numerical methods for solving these kind of partial differential equations.

74
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:58,280
So numerically solving partial differential equations has been a huge thing in engineering and is going to be continued to be a huge thing and

75
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,420
even bigger in engineering in the future.

76
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:11,460
So these two motivations in science and engineering, they are very advanced things.

77
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:18,420
But numerical solution of partial differential equations has also been in our daily life

78
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,780
for probably as long as we can remember.

79
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,660
An example is weather forecast.

80
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,260
So that's weather forecast of

81
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,420
here in the next few days.

82
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:43,420
And many of us didn't really think about it, but the forecast is achieved through numerically solving a set of partial differential equations

83
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:47,420
that governs the evolution of the atmosphere.

84
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:57,420
And in that numerical solution, the differential equation doesn't know anything about, for example, hurricanes.

85
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,420
It only knows about the weather.

86
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:06,420
It only knows how does the velocity and pressure and humidity change corresponding to the environment around them.

87
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:18,420
But once you put these equations into the computer, you will see all kinds of phenomenons like hurricanes and polar vortices and things like that.

88
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:22,420
And this is pretty amazing to me.

89
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:26,420
The accuracy of numerical simulations has gone up

90
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,420
over the years.

91
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:32,420
And so does the accuracy of weather forecast.

92
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:45,420
And by the way, weather forecast is an extremely difficult thing to do, especially well into the future because of something called chaos.

93
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,420
And

94
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:53,420
exponential increase in the accuracy of numerical simulations is going to get you only

95
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,420
linear increase or incremental increase in how many days.

96
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,420
You can forecast in the future.

97
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:10,420
So the difference between being able to forecast three days and five days is really all those of magnitude larger computing power you can put into solving these equations.
