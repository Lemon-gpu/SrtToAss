1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,960
Okay, so that's how to run a parametric sweep.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,880
You add a global parameter.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:12,080
You use that parameter to drive any part of the model, including the geometry or any physical

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,400
calculations or even mesh nodes, mesh density, and then you can compute and then compare

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,620
the results.

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,960
I do want to show you the very last step, was converting from model to an app.

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:29,600
I won't go into too much details here because I think we are getting closer with time.

8
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,140
So I have 14 more minutes, right?

9
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,140
To 1055?

10
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,140
Okay.

11
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:43,560
So what I'll do is I will show you app building 101 or even 000.

12
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:51,100
So what I'll do is I'll pick one model that's already built and solved in COMSOL in the

13
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,480
... Let's see.

14
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,100
So first of all, how to get here.

15
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,480
When you ... After you install the trial of COMSOL, go to ...

16
00:00:59,480 --> 00:00:59,580
Okay.

17
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,820
... File, Application Library.

18
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:05,400
Here's the collection of examples we have built with each of the module.

19
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,760
So before you want to build a molecular flow problem, don't do it yet.

20
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,280
Go into one of the example, open the PDF.

21
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,520
Each of the example comes with a PDF including a background introduction of that particular

22
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:26,520
example plus some meaningful results and analysis plus a step-by-step instruction of how this

23
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,740
model was built.

24
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,460
So duplicate a couple of them.

25
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,520
Just to familiarize yourself with the workflow and where to find out different options.

26
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,700
Or hopefully there is even an example that's similar to exactly what you want to do.

27
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,660
And then make changes on that and start building your own model.

28
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:46,140
So what I'll use right here ... Well, so first of all, before you attend Wednesday's class,

29
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,480
I would strongly recommend you to go through the COMSOL multi-physics, which is the base

30
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,400
package and the equation-based examples here.

31
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,260
So some of those, Tammy will be explaining a lot more details, but it doesn't hurt to

32
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,460
just have a preview of those.

33
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,460
Okay.

34
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:05,960
So right now, to demonstrate the app building, I'm going to use one under multi-physics and

35
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,960
it's called the BossBar.

36
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,080
I'm going to open that model.

37
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,160
If you do want to know how to build this BossBar, which is another dual heating problem, that's

38
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,160
intro booklet.

39
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,460
There are two examples you can work through.

40
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,340
Again, step-by-step instructions.

41
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,740
The second one is this BossBar one.

42
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:27,180
I mentioned that this example, although it's electrical and heat transfer so far, it can

43
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,460
easily become a fluid flow problem.

44
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:33,700
Because you can add a surrounding box and introduce convective cooling, which is a lot

45
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:38,860
of times happens in especially older generation laptop when you have a fan inside that helps

46
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,900
you have the cooling of the actual component.

47
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,560
So you can add fluid flow on top of that.

48
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,500
That's what I mean.

49
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,080
So here is the working model.

50
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,080
Again, it's soft.

51
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,080
It has colorful images.

52
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,420
It's the actual current plus heat transfer.

53
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:57,280
I want to use this one because it already has a defined parameter list that controls

54
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,340
the different parts of the system.

55
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,800
So how do I convert this model to an app?

56
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:07,620
If you are using Windows and you have the console ribbon on the top and you'll see the

57
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,140
first button here is called Application Builder.

58
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,840
Hit the Application Builder button.

59
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,360
Now you are switched from Model Builder to Application Builder.

60
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,460
There is a button to switch you back, again, on the Home tab, the first tab here.

61
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:25,140
So the two key concepts here I want to introduce is a new form and a new method.

62
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,340
A new form is essentially the layout of your user-defined app.

63
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:33,560
So you add a new form, you tell CommSol what you want to include on that front panel.

64
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,780
It's like LabVIEW for those of you who know.

65
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,440
So, for example, I want my user to be able to change a few parameters.

66
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,700
I want them to be able to see what is the temperature plot.

67
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,020
I want to give them some buttons, for example, a compute button.

68
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:49,780
So that's it.

69
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,500
So that's the layout of the app.

70
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,760
I could move things around.

71
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,820
It's essentially a PowerPoint.

72
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,620
I could resize the graphics window.

73
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:02,740
And then when you hit test application, it'll just work.

74
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:07,980
You could either run the app through a CommSol license or CommSol server license.

75
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,920
The demo.comsol.com link I gave earlier allows you to upload and run apps.

76
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:18,580
So anywhere you are, as long as you have internet access, you don't have to use a Windows machine to run an app.

77
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:21,500
Any platform, including your iPhone, would be able to run an app.

78
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,460
So you can just log into that website.

79
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,320
Either upload or if you already saved it out, then you can just hit compute.

80
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,060
Change one of the parameters.

81
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,780
It'll work and it'll give you the results.

82
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,080
This is not, well, this is the very simple version of it.

83
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,340
You can also add a method.

84
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,060
So method is essentially a JavaScript environment.

85
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,160
So I myself don't know any Java.

86
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,860
So how am I going to demonstrate it?

87
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,520
I'm going to record a code.

88
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:55,240
So now everything here shows in a round box, a red box.

89
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,340
So I'm going to switch back to Model Builder.

90
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,320
Say if I share.

91
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:02,440
I'm going to change any part of the model from 6 to 8.

92
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,940
I'll do something else.

93
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,040
Change the mesh to user defined.

94
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,100
Build a mesh.

95
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,780
And I could stop recording, go back to my app builder.

96
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,440
Everything I did will be recorded as a JavaScript.

97
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,840
So at least you know where to go.

98
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:23,180
And now instead of 8, I'm smart enough to know I can change that 8 into a different parameter and that'll still work.

99
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,400
And then on top of that, you can add more things.

100
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,660
So.

101
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:34,580
I'll show you one example that everybody knows and the beauty of it is actually play some sound.

102
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,240
So I'm going to find.

103
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,780
Yeah, so every application.

104
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,980
So the ones with the app interface is in the application folder.

105
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,160
Each of the module has an application folder.

106
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:47,780
So the ACDC example with the app interface that's actually in that folder.

107
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,940
So I'm going to show you a tuning fork.

108
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,000
Directly hit run app.

109
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,060
Don't save the change.

110
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,740
So this is a tuning fork app.

111
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:01,880
It runs in two modes.

112
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,880
You can tell Comso how long the tuning fork forks are.

113
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,160
The prone length.

114
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,700
And it computes.

115
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,000
It's going to tell you the natural frequency.

116
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,120
So that is what a

117
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,700
455.6 Hz sounds like.

118
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:25,560
The other mode it works on is actually a combination of structural mechanics and optimization.

119
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,840
So I want to.

120
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:27,600
I mean.

121
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,360
I want to.

122
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,180
You know maybe.

123
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,660
Next to a 3D printer.

124
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,860
I want to say I want to.

125
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,080
50, 90, 490 Hz.

126
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,160
Tell me how long that the prone length should be.

127
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,020
It's going to take slightly longer because of the optimization algorithm here.

128
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,160
And by the way to add that optimization.

129
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,240
Literally one expression in one step of the solver.

130
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,520
Not complicated at all.

131
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,420
So you can see that.

132
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,200
It's going to be.

133
00:06:59,460 --> 00:06:59,960
A little bit.

134
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:00,740
A little bit.

135
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:01,500
A little bit.

136
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,520
Slightly higher pitch.

137
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:06,360
So if you have good ears you can tell the difference between 450 and 490.

138
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:10,720
Or if you are tuning your violin you can maybe use the app as well.

139
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,600
All right so that's the very last step here from the model to the app.

140
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,180
So app is essentially a model plus a user interface.

141
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:24,540
And by user interface we mean not only just the front cover of it.

142
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,300
Like the W.

143
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,840
But also the back wires.

144
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,380
Which is what makes the buttons work.

145
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,660
So you can associate different.

146
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,200
Commands with the different buttons.

147
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,980
Trigger them to do different things.

148
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,640
So the app builder is only including Windows because it so far uses the Windows native technology.

149
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:44,240
But once you have the app as I said you can run across all the different smart devices.

150
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,580
So the server I mentioned.

151
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,140
So once you log in it's actually.

152
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,700
Nothing you need to set up.

153
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,240
So you basically.

154
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,020
I've set you to be the user.

155
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:56,800
Authority.

156
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,380
So you can run any of the.

157
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,920
Apps that's been uploaded out.

158
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,960
We use them for workshop demos a lot of times.

159
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,000
You can upload your own.

160
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,060
And then you can run your own.

161
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,340
Apps from now.

162
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,880
So for show and tell right.

163
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,440
Okay so.

164
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,500
Next thing I just want to say a few quick words about.

165
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,560
We'll show you some colorful images.

166
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,340
Before the end of the presentation.

167
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,640
So for the electrical category.

168
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:26,280
The ACDC module as I mentioned does a lower frequency or even stationary and transient problems.

169
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:26,800
So.

170
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:27,860
When you simulate.

171
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,160
I know you are from different engineering courses.

172
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:37,080
So when you're simulating like conductors, resistors, inductors, capacitors, calculate capacitances.

173
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,900
Or the transformers, generators.

174
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,720
They can use ACDC module.

175
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,780
Anything that's involving the full Maxwell equation.

176
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,340
So the wave propagation that is RF module.

177
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,400
When you have the.

178
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,740
You know when the system size, the simulation domain size is much larger than the wavelength.

179
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,540
Computational effort goes up.

180
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,860
Very very quickly.

181
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,920
So usually the rule of thumb is you have your.

182
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,480
10 wavelengths by 10 wavelengths by 10 wavelengths.

183
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,280
For the full Maxwell equation.

184
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:08,880
You probably want to have a machine with 64 gigabit of memory or more.

185
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,400
So.

186
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:16,040
Basically it scales very quickly because for each of the wavelengths you want to have at least 5 quadratic elements.

187
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,360
So when you go beyond that system size.

188
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,440
You use an alternative approach. Either beam envelope method.

189
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,480
A slow invariant beam capturing the wave.

190
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,280
With the capturing.

191
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,880
Faster wave in each of the wavelengths.

192
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,940
Or the ray tracing.

193
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,000
Technique in the ray optics module.

194
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:40,100
Plasma module that works on all the different dimensions.

195
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,460
And then you can couple with the existing coil designs as well.

196
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:51,120
It basically covers the ICP, the inductively coupled plasma, CCP, the capacitively coupled

197
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,400
microwave plasma.

198
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,200
And also the DC discharge plasma as well.

199
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:55,720
So the.

200
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,000
So the low temperature.

201
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:57,760
9 qubit.

202
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,860
And then the MAMS module. I mentioned this.

203
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,440
Basically a combined capability from ACDC and structural.

204
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,000
Plus the unique airfo-mechanics in space.

205
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:15,180
So some of the examples here are antenna communications on an airplane and also in the windshield wipers in the car.

206
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,800
And yeah this example is actually quite a popular one. It's called thermal lensing.

207
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,880
So we have ray tracing but the lens actually.

208
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,420
Expands because of thermal effects.

209
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,520
And then you have that the shift of the focal.

210
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,320
Then the mechanical branch.

211
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,600
So the.

212
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,440
No matter what dimension it is. You can have the 1d beam and truss network.

213
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,520
Or you can have the 2d membrane or shells. You can have a 3d solid.

214
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,320
Or a combination of those materials.

215
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,400
As long as they are linear materials. You can use structural mechanics module for it.

216
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,720
Then the different non-linearity.

217
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,280
Using the non-linear structural materials module.

218
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:54,140
I do want to emphasize that if you do deal with piezoelectric actuation in any of the cases.

219
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,420
Then the structural mechanics module.

220
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,820
Can deal with any type of orientation of the piezoelectric activity.

221
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,400
A reinforced concrete beam in picture number one.

222
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,700
And let's see what else.

223
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,040
Fluid structure interaction way in that the satellite panel.

224
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:13,380
So basically that's another pretty fun coupled in space in COMSO.

225
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,680
Which saw fluid flow and solid mechanics.

226
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,480
And the moving mesh mechanism.

227
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,300
The arbitrary log around Eulerian method.

228
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,860
The moving mesh in COMSO.

229
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,140
There's also.

230
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,420
Comparing to the moving mesh.

231
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,020
There's also something called a deformed geometry.

232
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,100
The difference is that moving mesh captures the same material frame.

233
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,160
Which means that there's no addition or removal of material.

234
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,220
To introduce that shape change.

235
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,780
You're literally deforming certain existing.

236
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,060
Sixth-max geometry.

237
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,840
So when you have a.

238
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:42,880
For example an.

239
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,160
Electrodeposition.

240
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,440
Or corrosion problem.

241
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,960
Then that's a deformed geometry.

242
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,240
Because you're adding materials.

243
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,280
Or moving materials.

244
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,800
Or some growth of materials.

245
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,400
I don't know if you have.

246
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,420
So far in the lecture.

247
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,020
Where the level set and the phase field method is.

248
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,580
So basically we have.

249
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,160
Well I'll talk about it in the next slide actually.

250
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,480
We have two phase flow.

251
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,000
If you want to track where the interface.

252
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,820
The surface tension induced.

253
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,880
And the momentum induced.

254
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,180
The shape change of the meniscus.

255
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,000
Then you could use either the level set or phase field method.

256
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,780
Which is essentially another set.

257
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,580
Or two additional.

258
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,600
Deformed volumes.

259
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,140
On top of the Navier-Stokes equation.

260
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,420
And the.

261
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,740
Additional parameter.

262
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,520
Basically when.

263
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,300
Larger than 0.5 is one phase.

264
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,100
More than 0.5 is another phase.

265
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,640
And it's a diffused in phase.

266
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,440
As opposed to the third method in.

267
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,480
Tracking the in phase.

268
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,760
Is the moving mesh method.

269
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,280
Which you have an x-ray mesh.

270
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,820
So the level set and phase field.

271
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,840
Solved on fixed mesh.

272
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,900
And moving mesh actually disturbed the.

273
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,440
Perturbs the mesh nodes.

274
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,240
Limitation of moving mesh is that.

275
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,300
You cannot merge or split the nodes.

276
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,340
You cannot make nodes disappear.

277
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,640
So basically we have a.

278
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,420
Joclet.

279
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,740
Merging or breaking.

280
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,520
Problems.

281
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,540
That you cannot use the moving mesh.

282
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,560
But the other two methods.

283
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,320
Still work.

284
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,860
They have different other concepts.

285
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,880
In terms of the.

286
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,940
Solving other types of physics as well.

287
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,260
So the.

288
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,320
Just want to briefly talk about examples here.

289
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,600
The first one is the.

290
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,360
Heated floor.

291
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,900
So it uses the.

292
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,440
Piped flow module.

293
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,960
For the non-isothermal pipe flow.

294
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,520
The pipe flow can actually do piped acoustics as well.

295
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,080
And you can specify different pipe cross-section shapes.

296
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,120
And the geometry.

297
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,420
Heat transfer.

298
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,000
So that's a hidden tube.

299
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,020
Exchanger.

300
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,300
That you can have.

301
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,140
Because both the heat transfer part and fluid part are based on.

302
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,220
So the flux calculation is most accurate.

303
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,040
And the coupling is the most accurate as well.

304
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,560
So some simulator conditions.

305
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,100
You use in your heat sink.

306
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,480
So that's the corrosion.

307
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,240
And the.

308
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,520
Plating that I mentioned.

309
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,800
So that's the electrochemistry.

310
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:51,580
On top of the.

311
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,120
Deformed geometry.

312
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,140
You know.

313
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,160
For the mesh.

314
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,520
And then there's some surface reaction.

315
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,280
And the.

316
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,040
Dark curves.

317
00:13:59,300 --> 00:13:59,560
For the.

318
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,580
Sexy photometry.

319
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,880
So I do want to.

320
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,960
Quickly mention that optimization module. A lot of times people use.

321
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,040
Two different scenarios. One is called the shape optimization.

322
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,080
That's the top one. Which is actually.

323
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,900
Acoustics problem with straight walls on the horn.

324
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:14,660
In the beginning.

325
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,680
And then you allow five.

326
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,500
Points. Physical points to move on their boundaries.

327
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,780
To make the corrugated shape.

328
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,840
To get a maximum sound effect.

329
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:25,160
So again. You cannot have mesh nodes crossing each other.

330
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:25,680
So.

331
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,480
You'll end up with the same topology.

332
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,260
You won't go from a sphere to a donut.

333
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,080
If you do want to go from a sphere to a donut.

334
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,640
Any number of holes. You use the topology optimization.

335
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,440
That basically.

336
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,020
Just specify what the bounding box. And you can have shaded material anywhere.

337
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,620
Alright. I think.

338
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,700
Yeah. That's pretty much it.

339
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,420
So just want to emphasize the resources that you can use.
