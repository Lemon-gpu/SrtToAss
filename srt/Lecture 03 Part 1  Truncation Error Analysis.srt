1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,320
partial square u partial x is approximated by the finite difference

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:16,280
operator ui plus 1 plus ui minus 1 minus 2 ui divided by delta x square. And then

3
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:23,080
we worked out the truncation error and if you remember we wrote down ui plus 1

4
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:31,360
over delta x square ui minus 1 over delta x square and the minus 2 ui over

5
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:40,780
delta x square and minus partial square u partial x square. So this formula if I

6
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:51,220
put a plus over here is the error of that approximation. Right so this is

7
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,040
equal to tau

8
00:00:53,040 --> 00:01:01,140
and how do we figure out how large or how small tau is? We did an expansion

9
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:11,100
over Taylor series. Right we expanded what is the term that contains ui. So for

10
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:18,900
example this is just ui this is also just a ui this is minus 2 ui over delta x

11
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,000
square this is 0 so that cancel out to be 0.

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,020
So this is minus 2 ui over delta x square this is 0 so that cancel out to be 0. So that cancel out to be 0.

13
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:31,000
We also have a ui prime part which is the first derivative and that turns out

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:39,580
to be that and this turns out to be minus that. There is no square because

15
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:46,860
one of the squares cancel out and 0 0 we get 0. And so we also use Taylor series

16
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:52,980
to expand this part this part this is also going to be 0 this is

17
00:01:52,980 --> 00:02:00,360
going to be just itself and we also get 0 and this one we also get 0 and only

18
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:06,300
in the in this term we get something that is proportional to delta x to the

19
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:14,880
fourth. That means our approximation error I think sorry delta x to the fourth

20
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:20,760
also divided by delta x square which gets to delta x square right that means

21
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,940
our approximation error is equal to delta x squared. So this is our approximation error.

22
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:32,320
is we write it as big O times delta x to the fourth to the second sorry to the

23
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:39,080
second because the fourth cancels with the second. What this big O notation

24
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:48,920
means is that as delta x goes to 0 the rate of decay of this truncation error

25
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,900
is delta x squared.

26
00:02:52,900 --> 00:03:00,120
Okay this means this is equal to a constant let me write down as c2 times x

27
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:07,280
squared plus maybe another constant times delta x cubed plus maybe another

28
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:14,000
constant times delta x fourth etc. But we don't really care that much about c3 c4

29
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,300
etc. because when delta x is small enough all of these we call high-order terms is

30
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,800
going to be negligible.

31
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:31,400
Compared to the delta x squared term right. So if you look at this truncation

32
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:40,620
error we'd like usually to plot it in a log-log plot. In this log-log plot the x

33
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:49,160
axis is our delta x. The y-axis let's say here we used to denote the truncation

34
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,660
error tau.

35
00:03:52,900 --> 00:04:02,140
Okay and let's say our delta x is 1 over here is 0.1 over here is 0.01 over here

36
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:12,040
10 to the minus 4 over here actually 3 over here 10 to the minus 4 over here 10

37
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:20,940
to the minus 5 over here. If when delta x is equal to 1 the truncation error is

38
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,940
over here.

39
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:30,580
When delta x decreases to 0.1 maybe the truncation error is over here but at

40
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,660
some point

41
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,580
tau is going to decay when delta x is small enough.

42
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:42,640
Tau is going to decay like delta x squared. That rate of decay in a log-log

43
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,480
plot

44
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:49,140
what would it look like? What is going to be the slope? It's going to be 2. Yes

45
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:52,900
which means let's say if the decay the correct decay

46
00:04:52,900 --> 00:05:01,660
rate starts from here then when delta x becomes 0.01 what is going to be the

47
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:11,480
error? What is going to be tau? So if you go over a factor of 10 over here you

48
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:19,520
should go over two factors of 10 in the y-axis right so you should get to here.

49
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,540
So your decay rate should be like that.

50
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:31,580
All right. So that is that is the correct line for tau

51
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:38,000
being Big-O delta x squared

52
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,460
Okay.

53
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,220
A similar analysis can be used to look at the solution error

54
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,420
and for example you are a project

55
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:52,820
you

56
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:58,820
compare a numerical solution with analytical solution. And the difference

57
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:03,460
the difference between analytical and numerical solution can also be

58
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:09,200
quantified in a similar way as you refine your grid. And if for example you

59
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:18,000
know your scheme its second order and your solution is second order, then as

60
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,640
you refine the grid, as you increase the n decrease the delta x, you should find

61
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:30,240
your solution error to decay in that rate. And if you are careful you should

62
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:37,320
actually plot it using MATLAB and see if the slope is actually 2. If your slope

63
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:43,400
is 1, that means you probably have a bug somewhere that makes your scheme not

64
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,720
really second order. It's going to be a first order scheme.

65
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:47,920
So that's the first order scheme.

66
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:59,580
Alright, for example, an example of a first order scheme can be seen as

67
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:05,960
discretizing the first order derivative. Let me say the most intuitive

68
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:13,160
way to discretize it is ui plus 1 minus ui divided by delta x. I mean one of the

69
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:17,840
intuitive way to discretize it. Now if you look at the

70
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:17,960
ability to discretize a derivative, the first order derivative is actually 1 for the derivative, so it's not 2 for the derivative. So if you look at the

71
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:27,620
approximation error, we have ui minus ui over delta x plus ui plus 1 over delta x,

72
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:35,200
and we subtract this numerical approximation from the analytical

73
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:42,240
derivative it tries to approximate. This is equal to tau. We do Taylor series and

74
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:53,580
this term is just itself. This term is ui over delta x, plus ui over times delta x

75
00:07:53,580 --> 00:08:00,180
divided by delta x. So nothing. just a ui prime. Alright and we also have

76
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:05,940
a second order derivative. It is going to be half like 2 factorial which is 2

77
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:11,760
delta x times ui double prime. and plus

78
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,180
...

79
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:12,220
and we subtract all the Vid przygot Anyways, the nulls, theals and the putims, all are the same.

80
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:19,500
Delta x squared over 6, that's 3 factorial ui third derivative, etc.

81
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,680
And here is 0.

82
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,760
Any questions about the Taylor series of ui plus 1?

83
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:32,960
And I'm writing down very quickly, but once you start going into this class,

84
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,840
you should be able to do Taylor series analysis as quickly.

85
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:42,160
Once you exercise it, it becomes really natural.

86
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:50,960
This is 0, this is just a minus ui prime, so this is at xi, and 0, 0, etc.

87
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:59,940
So if you add them together, look at tau, the first term cancels, 0, as it should be.

88
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,180
The second term cancels, 0, as it should be.

89
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,280
The third term no longer cancels.

90
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,180
So that is going to be the leading term.

91
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,760
The leading term in the truncation error.

92
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:21,260
That is ui double prime times half of second derivative of u.

93
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:27,760
Alright, so in this case, my tau is all what?

94
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,760
Just delta x, no square.

95
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,760
Alright.

96
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,760
And if you look over here, if I have a truncation error that decays like delta x,

97
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,760
what should I have?

98
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:50,220
If I have truncation error decay like delta x, I should have a line that is of slope 1.

99
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:55,980
If it's here, then as you decrease by a factor of 10, you should become,

100
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,220
the tau should also decay by a factor of 10.

101
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:02,380
So you should get a line that is shallower than the red line.

102
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,600
Question?

103
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,720
If you approximated ddx,

104
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,060
you did a good job.

105
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,220
Yeah.

106
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:16,380
If you were estimating ui plus 1 minus ui minus 1 by 2 delta x,

107
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,880
wouldn't you get more cancellation if you decrease it out?

108
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,880
That's a good point.

109
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:22,980
Right.

110
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:37,980
So the question is, if I discretize this using, instead of ui plus 1 and ui,

111
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,980
if I approximate using ui plus 1,

112
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,980
if I approximate using ui plus 1 and ui,

113
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:45,980
then I divide by 2 delta x.

114
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:51,980
If you do the Taylor series again, it's a little bit more involved.

115
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:56,980
You're going to find I'm also going to cancel a u delta x term.

116
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:02,980
I'm going to get discretization error that is proportional to delta x squared.

117
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:03,980
You're right.

118
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,980
The exercise is left at home.

119
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:07,980
All right.

120
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,980
So, yeah.

121
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:14,980
If you want second order scheme in your project, for example,

122
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,980
this is probably what you should be using.
