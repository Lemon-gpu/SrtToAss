1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So there are three elements in here, three things we need to calculate. One is the area of each triangle.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And what is the gradient of each of these basis functions on the triangle.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Okay, so let's figure out how to calculate the area first.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So to make it easier, let's make a script.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Go to script, find element 2D.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Okay, I'm going to assume I already have the P, T, and IB calculated.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to first try to calculate the area.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Area is going to be zeros, the number of elements.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So let me first...

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Okay, so number of elements is equal to the length of the triangles.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So it's triangles, the second dimension.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So any is the number of triangles.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So A...

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Let me reserve the big A for the matrix.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So let me call it small a to be the area.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So let me see.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So this is the area, small a.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Okay.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So small a is equal to any at 1.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And I'm going to go over all the triangles.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Okay.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The area is going to be equal to...

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's really...

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So I need to figure out two of the edges and do a cross product between the two edges.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
That divided by 2 is going to be the area.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Right.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So let me first compute the vertices.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So v1...

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Okay, so let me say v is equal to zeros, 2, 3.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So I have a vertex array.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
The first dimension is x and y.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The second dimension is the three vertices of the triangle.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So v1 is equal to my p of...

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Okay.

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:27,000
My p of column and my t of 1 and i.

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Right.

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So this is the location of the first vertex.

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So my second vertex...

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
To make it a little bit clearer, let me just call it v1.

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Let me just call it v2.

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Let me just call it v3.

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So 2 and 3.

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
All right.

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So these are the three vertices.

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Each one is just two numbers, x and y.

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So ai is the cross product, which is really the dot product of v1 minus v2.

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And basically the rotated vector of v1 minus v3.

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Right.

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So let me here...

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm just going to make it a matrix times...

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The rotated vector is 0, 1 minus 1, 0.

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Right.

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So it's this...

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You basically take one of the edges, you rotate it by 90 degrees, and you dot product with the other edge.

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
That's the cross product.

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
All right.

57
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So that divided by 2 is going to be the area.

58
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So you want it to be 3.

59
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Oh, yes.

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
One of them should be 3.

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Thank you.

62
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So let's run it to see what I get.

63
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I get an a that is equal to a bunch of things.

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And the magnitude seems to match the size of the areas.

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
All right.

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Okay.

67
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Any questions on this?

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
No?

69
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Okay.

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So next we have the area.

71
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Next is to compute the gradients of the basis functions.

72
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Okay.

73
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:36,000
In order to compute the gradient, let's use the fact that if I have the gradient of phi i,

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:44,000
the gradient of phi i dot with any vector, let's say the vector of v...

75
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The location of the vertex i minus the location of the vertex j, for example.

76
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
This should be equal to what?

77
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
The gradient of that particular basis function that is equal to 1 at v i and 0 at v j.

78
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
What should it be?

79
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The gradient of a linear function dot with a vector should be what?

80
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
This should be the value of that phi i at v i minus the location of the vertex j.

81
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So this should be the gradient of phi i at v i minus the value...

82
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Let me say it's x i and x j.

83
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Sorry.

84
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So x is the location of the vertices.

85
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Right?

86
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So if I have a gradient of phi i dot with the difference between the two locations,

87
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
this should be phi i at x i minus phi i at x j.

88
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Right?

89
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
This should be what?

90
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Should be 1.

91
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Right?

92
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Because unless i is equal to j.

93
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So for any x j that is in the triangle but different from i,

94
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
the gradient dot this should be equal to 1.

95
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Okay?

96
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So let me...

97
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Now we have the three x's in the triangle.

98
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
There are two independent j's I can use.

99
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So that allows me to form two linear equations whose right hand side are just 1 and 1.

100
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
The left hand side is...

101
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:27,000
The left hand side is a matrix that is formed by...

102
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Let me see.

103
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So x...

104
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
x1 minus x2.

105
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So let's call it y1 minus y2.

106
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
x1 minus x3.

107
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
y1 minus y3.

108
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So these are x and y coordinates.

109
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Dot with the x-directional gradient of the first basis and y gradient of the first basis.

110
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
That should be equal to 1 and 1.

111
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Right?

112
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So this gives us linear equations to solve for the gradient as a vector.

113
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So let's form the matrix.

114
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And compute it.

115
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So to form the matrix we just need v1 minus v2.

116
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So that is our first row.

117
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So we need to transpose it to get a row vector.

118
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:31,000
And v1 minus v3 transpose to get a row vector.

119
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So this inverse times the right hand side, 1, 1.

120
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
This is going to be the gradient of the first basis.

121
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Right?

122
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And I can do these three times to get the gradients of the three basis functions associated with that triangle.

123
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So g2 should be 2, 3.

124
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
This should be 3, 1.

125
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
This should be 2, 3.

126
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
This should be 1 and 2.

127
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So each of the matrix is formed by the difference between one vector and the other two vectors on the triangle.

128
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Okay, so now we get the three gradients.

129
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So now we have all the formula we need to compute the value of the matrix.

130
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Right?

131
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
But the matrix is a summation over all the values.

132
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Right?

133
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So we have the summation over all the elements.

134
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Now instead of going through all the pairs of i and j and figure out all the elements that are shared by the basis function i and the basis function j.

135
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
We loop over the elements and accumulate these values of a and j.

136
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So we loop over all the k's and look for whichever pairs of i and j this k contributes to.

137
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
We just add it on top of it.

138
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to make a matrix a is equal to 0.

139
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:16,000
What's the size of this matrix?

140
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Should be the number of points.

141
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Right?

142
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So let's also make it mp is equal to size of p and 2.

143
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So that's the size of the matrix mp by mp.

144
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So this element has three basis functions that it can contribute to.

145
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So what I have to have is let me call it i1, i2, and i3.

146
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And these are just the i1.

147
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Let's simplify it.

148
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
i2 and i3.

149
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Right?

150
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So these are computing the three vertex points.

151
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And the same indices is going to, we're going to compute the contribution to.

152
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So i1 and i1 is going to be, is going to be accumulated by something.

153
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Right?

154
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So and we also have, basically we have nine.

155
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Values that we'll contribute to.

156
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So we have i2, i2.

157
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
We have i3, i3.

158
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
We also have the cross terms.

159
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
For example, i1, i3.

160
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
i2, i1.

161
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
So let's start rigorously.

162
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So i1, i2.

163
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
i1, i3.

164
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
i2, i3.

165
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And.

166
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Let's do this now.

167
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
And when we.

168
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The other side should be exactly the same.

169
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Because the matrix is symmetric.

170
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Right?

171
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So let's only construct one part of it.

172
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
For now.

173
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So the formula, according to the formula, this is summed by a of i.

174
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
The area.

175
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Times.

176
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
The gradient of phi i.

177
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Times the gradient of phi j.

178
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
So dot of g1 and g1.

179
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Right?

180
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
This is dot of.

181
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
g1.

182
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
g2 and g1.

183
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
g2 and g2.

184
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Sorry.

185
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
So this is.

186
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
2 and 2.

187
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
This is 3 and 3.

188
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
3 and 3.

189
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And this is 1 and 2.

190
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
This is 1 and 3.

191
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
2 and 3.

192
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
So here should be dot of g1 and g2.

193
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Here should be dot of g1 and g3.

194
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Here should be dot of g2 and g3.

195
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And let's.

196
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I mean, if we care about computational efficiency, you won't do this.

197
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
But let's do this just for the sake of clarity.

198
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
So I'm also going to be making.

199
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
The transpose of.

200
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
The transpose part of the matrix to be.

201
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Adding up on the same value.

202
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Okay.

203
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Any.

204
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Anything.

205
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Any bug in this.

206
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You can spot.

207
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3.

208
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
2, 1.

209
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Okay.

210
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Looks good to me.

211
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
All right.

212
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Since we have constructed the matrix.

213
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
So let's run it.

214
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Okay.

215
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Looks like it ran.

216
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And we have a matrix A.

217
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
So spy A should be.

218
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Something.

219
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Like that.

220
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Most of the A is.

221
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Empty, which means it's 0.

222
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And so for what we see as blue dots.

223
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
These are the locations on the matrix that are non-zero.

224
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
These are the coupling terms.

225
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
These are the neighbors.

226
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Of.

227
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Basis functions.

228
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
So.

229
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
This.

230
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Is.

231
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
All.

232
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Of.

233
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Bases.

234
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Functions.

235
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Right.

236
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
So for me.

237
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
What I want.

238
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
All.

239
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Is.

240
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
To do.

241
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Is.

242
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Is.

243
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Is.

244
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
To make this.

245
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
A.

246
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
A value.

247
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
So.

248
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I'm going to call this.

249
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
tiene.

250
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
This.

251
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Bases.

252
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And.

253
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
This.
