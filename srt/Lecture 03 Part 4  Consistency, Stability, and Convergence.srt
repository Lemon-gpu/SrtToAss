There is a very general way to analyze numerical schemes. That is, we want to

2
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:15,360
have convergence, which is we want to have my u hat goes to u analytic as

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:24,360
delta x and delta t goes to 0. This is what I want, right? Because I want

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:29,560
analytical solution, but u hat, the numerical solution, is all I can

5
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:35,200
compute. So if I look at the difference between them, I want that to go to 0 as I

6
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:41,500
invest more and more computational resources. But all I can know is

7
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:47,780
consistency. So I can analyze beforehand if I'm developing a numerical scheme. All

8
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:56,500
I know is how does tau goes to 0 as delta x and delta t goes to 0. Tau is

9
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,540
the approximation of all the differential operators

10
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:09,080
in my differential equation. So this is consistency. So what we analyzed

11
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:16,880
beforehand is that if I in addition have stability, which in the previous example

12
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:25,740
means just the norm of a is less than 1, a is the amplification of the solution

13
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,440
error as time increases.

14
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:38,660
That means if I have stability and I have consistency, when both is satisfied,

15
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:46,600
I will get convergence.

16
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:52,040
So when you are solving a differential equation, you want to check consistency, yes or no.

17
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,140
As I increase my mesh resolution, decrease time steps, do I have the truncation error

18
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,140
go to 0?

19
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,140
I want to check stability.

20
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,140
I want to check the time steps. Do I have the truncation error go to 0? I want to check stability.

21
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:06,140
If I don't have truncation error, would my solution error decay to 0 eventually?

22
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:12,320
For example, a good case to check is when the analytical solution is 0.

23
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:17,120
If you put up the numerical solution slightly, would it go back to 0?

24
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,060
And then you should have convergence.
