1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,200
So let's give that a try. So let's make another file, function dudt wave, and the t of u still, we have dudt.

2
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:27,500
So this u may not be a good, let's do phi and psi.

3
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:33,160
So let's give that a try. dudt of phi and psi.

4
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,400
I'll just write that as dudt.

5
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:46,000
So n is equal to length of phi psi over 2.

6
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,820
So because phi and psi,

7
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,600
is going to contain a variable that is discretized.

8
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,960
That is, so here I use the u and k, but this is,

9
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:06,740
yeah, so it contains the discretized phi and psi for all the spatial grid points.

10
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,080
Okay.

11
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:16,100
And phi is going to be equal to phi psi from 1 to n,

12
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,000
and psi is equal to phi psi,

13
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,100
from n plus 1 to n.

14
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:26,200
So this is basically splitting the input variable into the two different variables.

15
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,200
Does it make sense?

16
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,200
So let's use central difference.

17
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:40,200
And actually let me just copy what we did in this case.

18
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,200
Except for here we du dx.

19
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,200
And in this case we need d.

20
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,200
d.

21
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,760
d is equal to phi dx.

22
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:58,760
I would also want to say dx is equal to 2 pi over n.

23
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:09,180
And let's do a find and replace u with phi.

24
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,420
Replace all editor current file.

25
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,460
Looking okay.

26
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:30,200
Okay, here I actually saved it as dudt, so just to make it better, I will just rename

27
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:35,200
it as ddt, because we are not using u here.

28
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:47,160
Okay, ddt, not central, yeah, ddt central.

29
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,600
I opened the wrong file, yes, I opened the wrong file.

30
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:59,160
So this is still ddt central, I wanted ddt wave.

31
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:04,980
Alright.

32
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:09,400
How do you do a replacement only in the selection?

33
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:16,400
Anyway, so before I figure that out, I will just do a manual replacement.

34
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:16,920
Okay.

35
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,520
That's it, right?

36
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,720
So we have dphi dx and dpsi dx.

37
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:31,060
Both figured out.

38
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:41,480
And now our dphi dt is equal to dpsi dx, dpsi dt is equal to dphi dx, right?

39
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:46,400
That's our derivation of the wave equation.

40
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:46,900
Okay.

41
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:58,520
And the ddt is going to be, first I'm going to put, so in the beginning I have psi phi

42
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,440
in the beginning, so dphi dt and dpsi dt.

43
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,720
So that's my output of the function.

44
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,240
Alright.

45
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,320
So let's start with a phi being dpsi.

46
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,320
Okay.

47
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,320
So that's my output of the function.

48
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,320
Alright.

49
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,320
So let's start with a phi being dpsi dt.

50
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,000
Okay.

51
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,780
So I'm going to start with the same as my u0, maybe.

52
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:24,600
Oh, my u0 was a bad one, right?

53
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,900
So let me see.

54
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:37,960
U0 is equal to, let's set my phi zero to be that, and the psi zero to be phi zero multiplied

55
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,780
by zero.

56
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,280
So this corresponds to a wave that is initially phi.

57
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,280
Okay.

58
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,280
So now it's going to be a wave that is a very small wave.

59
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,280
Okay.

60
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:52,920
initially flat because du dx is initially equal to zero so the whole thing is flat the whole

61
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:59,800
solution is zero but with the initial velocity with the initial d ud t right that is like this

62
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:16,360
wave okay so let's do a t and uh phi and psi equal to od 45 of ddt wave zero so how long do

63
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:25,480
we want to integrate it still just uh let's let's do pi just to see what do we get and we put phi

64
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:29,720
first and psi second oh zero great

65
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,840
okay now we solved it

66
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:42,080
this is our solution we are only interested in the very last part so let's just plot it uh to see

67
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:55,400
x and phi psi and and one to a hundred right so that's our phi

68
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,700
oh i didn't

69
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,960
close the previous one

70
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,160
that doesn't look good

71
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,080
i must have made an error somewhere

72
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:26,800
okay so let's plot phi zero what is phi zero psi zero is zero okay let me see ddt wave

73
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:36,640
to end n plus one to the end

74
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,920
so if i do this from one direction to the other

75
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,540
my Î» 1 to the partial and when i do this from one direction to the other dangling to for right i'm wouldn't

76
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:03,540
so if I do this from 101 to 200 what is it giving us?

77
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:16,540
I don't know if it makes a difference but when you parse the 5 aside from the initial

78
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:24,540
values you're referring to a vector index and you're providing a matrix so instead of

79
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:35,540
the semicolon you can call the ODE.

80
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,540
You mean when I'm doing here?

81
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,540
Yeah, I don't know if that would...

82
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:45,540
Oh, thank you, yeah, that's right.

83
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,540
That's right.

84
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,540
That's what I should do.

85
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,540
Okay.

86
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,540
So let's see, plot the...

87
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,540
Now...

88
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,540
Now that's a lot better.

89
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,540
Okay.

90
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:05,540
And let's plot the side...

91
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,540
Okay, okay, that's good.

92
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:12,540
So let's do an animation of how this is going to work.

93
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,540
So let's do T...

94
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:19,540
Let's do I goes from 1 to 1000.

95
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:23,540
Let's actually keep this going.

96
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,540
So let's do this.

97
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,540
Okay, sorry.

98
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:36,540
So let's do 5 psi 0 equal to what we had in the beginning.

99
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,540
Okay.

100
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:42,540
And...

101
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:50,540
So let's do T and 5 psi is equal to that ODE 45.

102
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:54,540
Okay.

103
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,540
And let's only time integrate it for a short time.

104
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:03,540
So 0 to, let's say, 0.1.

105
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:07,540
5 psi 0 as initial condition.

106
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:17,540
And I'd like to hold off and plot x and 5 psi...

107
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,540
Okay.

108
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,540
Let's do 5 psi 0.

109
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:28,540
So we are going to overwrite the initial condition using the last solution of ODE 45.

110
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:35,540
And we are going to plot x with 5 psi 0, 1 to 100.

111
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:41,540
Let's use blue and hold on.

112
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:47,540
Plot x 5 psi 0 of 101 to 200.

113
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,540
Let's do red.

114
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:54,540
And let's pause for a little bit.

115
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,540
Pause.

116
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,540
Do I need to draw?

117
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,540
Maybe I don't.

118
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,540
And...

119
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:05,540
So let's see what do we get.

120
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:11,540
So that's the solution of the wave equation we see.

121
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:16,540
Because it's periodic, basically the wave goes out and comes back from the other side.

122
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:25,540
So remember when we look at the eigenvalues of the matrix, we get 1 and minus 1.

123
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,540
Right?

124
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:36,540
What that means is that similar to a linear advection equation which only has one velocity going towards the right,

125
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:40,540
in this equation we essentially have two velocities.

126
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:46,540
One going towards the right with velocity 1, another going towards the left at velocity 1.

127
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:54,540
It's a superposition of linear advection equations with 1 and minus 1 velocities.

128
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:59,540
And of course now we are seeing, because we are doing this for so long,

129
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:04,540
and using central difference, which error is taking its toll over here?

130
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,540
Dispersion error.

131
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,540
Dispersion error, right.

132
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:14,540
So we are seeing some of the frequencies are probably not at the right place anymore after evolving for so long.

133
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,540
But because we are using central difference, we are seeing that the frequencies are probably not at the right place anymore after evolving for so long.

134
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:22,540
But because we are using central difference scheme, there is not much, actually not any dissipation error in this numerical solution.

135
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:25,540
The wave keeps going.

136
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,540
Alright.

137
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,540
Any questions about this?

138
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,540
Yes?

139
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:35,540
What is the physical difference between a dissipation error and a dispersion error?

140
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:39,540
What is the physical difference?

141
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:43,540
Dissipation, it's...

142
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,540
So I think there is a...

143
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:49,540
So the physical meaning of what is dissipation, right,

144
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:57,540
I mean when you say dissipation error, that means you have a numerical error, not physical, that acts like a dissipation.

145
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:00,540
So...

146
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,540
Right.

147
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:04,540
Dissipation means it is diffusing things.

148
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:08,540
It is like the dissipation of heat, for example.

149
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:14,540
Dissipation of heat is if you have a very hot object, the heat is going to dissipate.

150
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:19,540
It means it is going to transfer the high temperature region into the lower temperature regions.

151
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,540
Entropy increases.

152
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:29,540
The hot thing is going to cool down and the cold thing is going to heat up due to dissipation of heat.

153
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,540
Dispersion is different.

154
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:39,540
Dispersion maintains how much energy or how much almost kinetic energy you have.

155
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,540
But like you have different components of the energy.

156
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:46,540
You have different components of the energy going into different places.

157
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:54,540
That's roughly my understanding of what dissipation and dispersion means.

158
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:58,540
Yes?

159
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:04,540
.

160
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,540
Yes.

161
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,540
How do I go back to you?

162
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,540
Good question.

163
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:15,540
The best way to go back to you is to look at both of the solutions.

164
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,540
For example, you have du dx.

165
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,540
Right?

166
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:30,540
If you integrate over the spatial domain for du dx, you are going to recover the solution u up to a constant.

167
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:37,540
And exactly what constant we are recovering, we need to look at the other component, du dt.

168
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,540
To decide from the last time step what is the constant.

169
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,540
To the next time step, what is the constant?

170
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,540
Right?

171
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:48,540
So we know, for example, we know the evolution of du dx.

172
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,540
We know the value of du dt.

173
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:55,540
So we know the averaged, spatially averaged du dt.

174
00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:02,540
And that is going to give us how the constant term, how the average of u is going to evolve as a function of time.

175
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:06,540
So you need to combine, again, combine these two solutions to recover the u.

176
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,540
Any other questions?

177
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,540
Yeah.

178
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,540
Any other questions?

179
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,540
Yeah.

180
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,540
Thank you.

181
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,540
Thank you.
