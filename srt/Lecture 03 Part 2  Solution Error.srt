1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Let me write a hat just to emphasize we have a numerical solution.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
hat, hat, hat.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We want to know what is the error which is u hat minus ua.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
What we know is the truncation error.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What we know is, well we don't know exactly, but we know how it behaves.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We know how fast it goes to zero as delta x decreases.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Actually, no.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Tau is equal to this, not on the numerical solution, but on the analytical solution.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So I'm going to write a here, a here, a here.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The important thing is that the discrete operator and the continuous operator is applied to the same solution when you're looking at Taylor series analysis.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:24,000
All of these analyses only are true when this and this is operated on the same function as this derivative.

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
If there are different functions, it doesn't apply.

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And they have to be analytic solution because only the analytic solution has a derivative.

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The discrete solutions, the ui hats, I mean they are only at discrete points.

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
They don't even have a derivative, a well defined, a uniquely defined derivative.

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So when we do truncation error, we apply this on the analytical solution.

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
All right.

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
But when you look at the solution error.

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And when you.

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And when you derive the evolution of the solution error by taking the analytical solution and the analytical equation and numerical solution and subtract them from each other.

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:20,000
What you get is dui hat dt minus partial ua partial t.

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So the left hand side would be equal to something very similar to the truncation error.

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
But not the truncation error.

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's not the truncation error because the discrete operator, the finite difference operator is operated on the discrete solution, not the analytical solution.

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And the derivative, the analytical derivative is operated on the analytical operator.

26
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So who remembers what we did to resolve that discrepancy?

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You summed and subtracted the same terms.

28
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So that's what we get there.

29
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Both the brain, they were subtracting and they added because.

30
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Exactly.

31
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So I added and subtracted a term that is u analytic.

32
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
i plus 1 plus u analytic.

33
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
i minus 1 minus 2u analytic i.

34
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Divided by delta x square.

35
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So I subtracted this term and I added the same term.

36
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Okay.

37
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So this is the term I added and subtracted which changes nothing.

38
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Right.

39
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Then I copy what I have originally on this equation.

40
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Also subtract derivative.

41
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Now I group here.

42
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I group here.

43
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I get two terms.

44
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:12,000
One of them, which is this term, is exactly equal to the truncation error.

45
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And this term goes like o delta x square.

46
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The first term.

47
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
They are the same operator operated on different solutions.

48
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And the difference between them is actually the discrete operator operated on what?

49
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
On u hat minus u a.

50
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Which is the error.

51
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So here we basically derived what's called the error equation.

52
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So the left hand side is basically de dt.

53
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
D.

54
00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:01,320
dt right this is the left hand side is equal to first of all this term is let

55
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:19,320
me say you ei okay ei so put an i here okay is equal to ei plus 1 plus ei

56
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:28,780
minus 1 minus 2 ei divided by Delta x squared so that's this first parenthesis

57
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:40,920
plus tau i this is called the error equation this is how the error of our

58
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:47,340
numerical solution evolves in time it has two terms one term is contribution

59
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,480
from tau i

60
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:58,980
the other term is a self evolution of this error okay and this is why we need

61
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:07,620
to make sure that this discrete operator itself is stable okay it is stable in

62
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:15,680
the sense that it has to be stable in the sense that if on the last time step

63
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,200
there is a certain amount of numerical error

64
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:24,360
if assuming we have no contribution from tau we have no contribution we have no

65
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,980
truncation error even in the absence of truncation error the error should decay

66
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:34,560
by itself at least it shouldn't amplify itself
