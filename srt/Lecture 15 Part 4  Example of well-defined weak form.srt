1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,840
An example of a coercive bilinear form and a non-coercive bilinear form can be looked at,

2
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:13,900
can be given by just using the Poisson's equation for different boundary conditions.

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:22,720
So case one, the Poisson's equation, a of u, u, this is scary.

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:33,600
Okay, so a of u, u for Poisson's equation is going to be equal to integration from,

5
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:41,180
let's look at the domain from 0 to 1, du, dx, sorry, a of u and v, right?

6
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:48,560
Right, so coercivity, we only need to look at a of u and u, du, dx, dx.

7
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,000
So this is for Poisson's equation with,

8
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:59,860
with u0 equal to u1 equal to 0, right?

9
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:07,020
So this is, we have this boundary condition because when we integrate by parts,

10
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:14,580
we have removed the boundary terms, right?

11
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:22,580
Okay, so let's look at the, let's look at a of u and u,

12
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:31,840
compared to the norm of u squared in H1 norm.

13
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,420
So the norm of u squared in H1 norm is of course equal to integration of u squared

14
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:41,260
plus the derivative of u squared dx.

15
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:49,040
Okay, and so let's see.

16
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:59,960
So we can obviously see the continuity of this because the continuity can be analyzed

17
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,960
using Cauchy-Schwarz.

18
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,560
So if you have u and v, you have, so you can make the inequality here.

19
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,220
But the coercivity is the other way.

20
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:15,060
We can't, we can, we can already see that a of u and u is less or equal to the norm of u squared.

21
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,720
But coercivity needs the other way, right?

22
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,560
We need our a of u and u to be greater or equal to a constant times the norm.

23
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,720
So here we need to use the Poincare's inequality.

24
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:38,720
Poincare's inequality basically says that this term is less than a constant times this term.

25
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:48,720
So, so integration u's, well the Poincare's inequality really says the integration of u minus the u bar

26
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,720
squared dx is less than a constant.

27
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,720
Okay?

28
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,720
So we can say that the Poincare's inequality is less than a constant, called the Poincare's

29
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,720
constant.

30
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:06,720
Let me just say as, let me just say is p, it's the Poincare's constant, du dx squared

31
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,220
dx.

32
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,320
Okay.

33
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:17,720
And the saving grace here is that we can replace, so here u bar is equal to the average of u

34
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,720
in the space, in the space.

35
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:30,960
So we can say that we can basically replace this u bar with zero here because u satisfies

36
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,220
two zero boundary conditions.

37
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,220
Right?

38
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:45,720
So we can, we can say that u bar can be replaced by, let's see, u bar is equal to, let's see,

39
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,720
u bar is equal to, let's see, u bar is equal to, let's see, u bar is equal to, let's see,

40
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,720
2, 0.

41
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,720
This part of the expression is present in the list of these terms that we have learned

42
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,720
for the Poincare's inequality.

43
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,720
And actually this is something that I'm record of sometimes, because I've been using a alphabetic

44
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,720
table, this loop Puerto Iglesias, all of the dy multiplication that we have done,

45
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,720
procedure.

46
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,720
So what does Trainer a, weaken a removed from the judging order here and October

47
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:10,720
15th we found that since I think that this two extra words per typist is

48
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,720
note already.

49
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,720
Further.

50
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,720
It's more, interesting.

51
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,720
After question number two, I think that penalty number, we implicitly afraid of

52
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,720
solution of these whose � sebel volte prime be ever given.

53
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,720
Okay?

54
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,720
So, 밑ıl the equütas coupling, we can sum these this, this up.

55
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,720
And if we get this inverse, we help this.

56
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,720
Now what do we get?

57
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,480
The x goes from 0 to 1.

58
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,500
And for any x, the integral of x prime goes from 0 to x.

59
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:33,100
So we are integrating the derivative in such a triangular shape.

60
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,020
So we can rewrite.

61
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:46,780
We can pull the integration of x prime out and have the du dx and times this x prime times dx.

62
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,140
So we are replacing the integral.

63
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,600
We're integrating over this first.

64
00:04:51,480 --> 00:05:01,320
And the integration over this part is actually integration of this times 1 minus x.

65
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:08,680
Because the length of the integration domain is 1 minus x.

66
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,660
So this is just a trick of when you have double integral.

67
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,760
You can exchange this to integral.

68
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:21,920
And because this is a function of delta x prime.

69
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:27,060
So you exchange the integrals and you get a lot simpler formula.

70
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:39,520
And this allows us to replace this u bar squared with the norm of the derivatives.

71
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:46,740
But through this, we can get the coercivity coefficient being a function of the Poincare constant.

72
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:55,520
So this allows us to bond the integration of u square with the integration of the derivative squared.

73
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,260
So this term can be pulled out as a function of du dx.

74
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,140
And that moves to the right-hand side.

75
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:15,780
So basically, we have integration of u square being less or equal to a certain constant times the integration of a certain constant.

76
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,720
Let's say p prime.

77
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:21,880
So we have integration of u square times the integration of du dx square.

78
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,040
And this is this term.

79
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:29,780
And then I still copy the same second order term, second term.

80
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,080
So that comes here.

81
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:42,060
So that gives us that the square of the h1 norm of u is less or equal to p prime plus 1 times the bilinear form.

82
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,260
Alright.

83
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,760
So that's a sketch of the proof.

84
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,160
We didn't go all the way through.

85
00:06:53,220 --> 00:07:04,600
So a counter example of coercivity is when instead of having derisional boundary conditions, we have Newman boundary conditions.

86
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:12,900
So if we have Newman boundary conditions on both sides,

87
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,300
so du dx,

88
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,760
equal to 0 at,

89
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,860
x equal to 0 at 1,

90
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,460
we're going to see we don't have coercivity.

91
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:29,140
Because a of u and u is going to be equal to 0, 1, du dx,

92
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,580
square dx.

93
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:38,480
And the norm of u square is equal to u square plus du dx,

94
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,100
square dx.

95
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:46,580
It turns out we can have constant functions that are constant between 0 and 1.

96
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,280
Right.

97
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,340
They satisfy the boundary condition.

98
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:56,220
But their bilinear form can be arbitrarily small, actually can be 0.

99
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:01,100
While the h1 norm of u is going to be not 0.

100
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:06,580
So this is an example that we don't have coercivity.

101
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:10,020
And the weak form is not well defined.

102
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:13,140
It's not well posed.

103
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:20,140
So a of u, v equal to l of v not well posed.

104
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:29,140
And this is because if you have 0 Newman boundary conditions at both ends,

105
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:34,140
for Poisson's equation, if you put a forcing into the,

106
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:39,140
if you put a right hand side whose integral is not equal to 0,

107
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,140
then there is no solution.

108
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,140
Right.

109
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:49,140
Well, there is no solution because,

110
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:57,140
because you can, you can integrate the second order derivative of u over dx.

111
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:02,140
This is just the first order derivative of u at 0 and 1.

112
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:07,140
It has to be 0 if we have Newman, Newman boundary condition at both ends.

113
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,140
And because of the Poisson's equation,

114
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,140
this also has to equal to minus,

115
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:14,140
integration of the right hand side dx.

116
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:22,140
So of course, this can be a contradiction because f can be an arbitrary function whose integral doesn't have to be 0.

117
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,140
Right.

118
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,140
So you have a lot of cases where you don't have a solution.

119
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:31,140
And this can, this is reflected in the fact that the bilinear form is not coercive.

120
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,140
Yes.

121
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,140
The derivation is the same.

122
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,140
I mean, the whole thing is still unretaining.

123
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,140
What coercivity is there?

124
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:46,140
What coercivity actually represents the .

125
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:52,140
It means the, so, okay.

126
00:09:52,140 --> 00:10:03,140
It means that it's a sufficient condition to guarantee that a is not singular in some sense.

127
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:09,140
So, so let me give an example of a bilinear form in a finite dimensional.

128
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,140
case.

129
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:17,140
So if u is in x is in Rn and v is in Rn.

130
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:23,140
So, so this, these are also perfectly reasonable spaces, right?

131
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,140
These are linear spaces.

132
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:31,140
And in this case, this a can be represented as a matrix.

133
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,140
Okay.

134
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,140
So a is a n by n.

135
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:43,140
So a is a n by n matrix.

136
00:10:43,140 --> 00:11:02,140
Coercivity, coercivity means that a u transpose, u transpose a v has to be greater or equal to a constant times the norm of u times the norm of v.

137
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:05,140
Right.

138
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:27,140
So if you, if you know the singular value decomposition of a matrix, this basically says that if I can represent the matrix as a singular value decomposition, this is going to be.

139
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,140
So, okay.

140
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,140
So.

141
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,140
So this is a.

142
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:41,140
So both big U and big V, they are.

143
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:44,140
Both big U and big V.

144
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,140
Well, sorry.

145
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:49,140
So coercivity means like this has to be the same for the same U, right?

146
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,140
Sorry.

147
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:54,140
Both big U and big V, they are also normal matrices.

148
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:58,140
So, so U times U and V times V, they are going to be the same.

149
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:01,140
They are going to preserve the L2 norm.

150
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:08,140
So, so it basically says that the singular values cannot be zero.

151
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,140
The singular values cannot be zero.

152
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:19,140
And wait, actually, that's, that's not exactly, that's not exactly the case.

153
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,140
So, okay.

154
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:29,140
So, so it's only, only if a is a symmetric matrix, we can do this because the singular value decomposition is the same as eigenvalue decompositions.

155
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,140
So what we have is U transpose.

156
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,140
So what we have is U transpose.

157
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,140
For only for symmetric matrices.

158
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:44,140
And what this says is for symmetric matrices, the coercivity means the eigenvalues has to be all positive.

159
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,140
Right.

160
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:55,140
So, so for non-symmetric matrix matrices, positive definities of the matrix, I think it's hard to connect with the singular values.

161
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:59,140
So this is a one way for, at least for me to understand.

162
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:07,140
What coercivity means in a, basically by thinking in the finite dimensional case, it's just a matrix.
