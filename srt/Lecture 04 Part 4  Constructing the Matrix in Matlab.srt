1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
Let's first construct the diagonal block.

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:07,720
Okay, so first of all, how big are they?

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,180
How big is each of these diagonal blocks?

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,660
ny minus 1 by ny minus 1, right?

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,520
Okay, so let's first construct these entries on the diagonal.

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:27,980
So before we do that, we need to compute dx is equal to 1 over nx minus 1.

7
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:32,460
dy is equal to 1 over ny minus 1.

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:52,100
So my diagonal block is going to be identity of ny minus 1 times minus 2 divided by delta x squared minus 2 divided by delta y squared.

9
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,620
All right, so my diagonal block.

10
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:01,760
Is just like that for now.

11
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:09,520
Okay, so I need to field in the upper and lower diagonals by 1 over delta y squared.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,340
So I'm going to teach you a different trick as I did last time.

13
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:22,060
This is equal to diagonal block plus a diagonal entry of 1.

14
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,200
So first of all, how many entries do they have?

15
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:32,340
They have two entries, which is ny minus 2, right?

16
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:42,220
So first of all, I construct the ones of ny minus 2 rows and one column.

17
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:47,140
So it's basically a column vector of ny minus 1 ones.

18
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,160
I'm going to divide it by delta y squared.

19
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:57,440
Okay, so I get the same size of row vectors of 1 over delta y squared.

20
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,660
I'm going to make it.

21
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,260
I'm going to.

22
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,360
So this is the second.

23
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,800
This is the first entry of the argument for diagonal.

24
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,460
The second entry is 1.

25
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,720
That means I don't want the exact diagonal.

26
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,260
I want it to be shifted to the.

27
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,540
I think 1 is upper diagonal.

28
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,040
I'm not sure.

29
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,900
Let's take a look.

30
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:15,840
Yes.

31
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,000
You see, this upper diagonal has changed to 9.

32
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,600
Which is 1 over delta y squared.

33
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,400
All right.

34
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,920
So that works.

35
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,480
Now I need to fill in the lower diagonals.

36
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,600
What should I do?

37
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,640
Minus 1 on this.

38
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,700
So I'm going to use the same command here.

39
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,180
But the second argument to diagonal is going to be minus 1.

40
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:45,220
So that helps me fill out the lower diagonal entries.

41
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:46,960
All right.

42
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,160
Okay.

43
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,940
So now I get a diagonal block like that.

44
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,880
How many of these diagonal blocks do I need to have?

45
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,640
Because we can limit them to holes bit Ooo.

46
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,880
So I can cup generated twohoods.

47
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:03,780
That's it.

48
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:04,980
Okay.

49
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,720
So let's continue reading.

50
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,260
Let's see this.

51
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,680
Let's take a look at that.

52
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,140
So usually salography command will be just greaxed.

53
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,540
In that case.

54
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:17,180
Basically, we will be reading what we need to see and how much will take into account in nat looks like alpha and 1.

55
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:21,980
Then we in the sample.

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,080
We just inherited same approach to theaken.

57
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,140
But instead of just talking about how could I methodically sporty trong the default method?

58
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:27,380
Then.

59
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:35,760
So if A is an identity matrix, B is this 2x2 matrix of 1, minus 1, minus 1, 1s.

60
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:44,740
Doing a crown of A and B is going to put the matrix B in a diagonal format of,

61
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,940
basically repeat B by 4 times and put them on diagonals.

62
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,960
So if you look at this example and think of our case, what should we do?

63
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,920
Which matrix is our B? Which matrix is our A in this case?

64
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:09,140
And yeah, B is going to be this matrix we just constructed, right?

65
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:13,840
We want to put that as blocks, blocks, blocks, right?

66
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,220
And A is identity.

67
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:24,220
So let's say my big matrix is equal to,

68
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:31,360
crown of identity of nx minus 1 and this diagonal block.

69
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,400
So now let's take a look at our big matrix.

70
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:44,060
So we have a block over here, we have a block over here, and a block over here, right?

71
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,400
Perfect.

72
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,060
So we have completed construction of the blocks.

73
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,240
And now we need to add the upper and lower diagonals.

74
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,960
So what should we do?

75
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,960
The lower diagonal of B1 delta y squared.

76
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,960
The lower diagonal, which one?

77
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,960
That lower diagonal.

78
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,460
Here?

79
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:07,960
Yes.

80
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,960
It's 1 over delta x squared, right?

81
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,960
It should be 1 over delta, or that one, B1 over delta y squared.

82
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,960
So this lower diagonal is offset by ny minus 1, right?

83
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,960
So if you look at the grid,

84
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,960
it's a range of, right?

85
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,960
It's shifting in a zigzagging fashion.

86
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,960
A shift by ny minus 1 in this case.

87
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,960
So if you go from here, you shift it by ny minus 1.

88
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,960
It's going this, this, and this.

89
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:42,960
It is the same as shifting the x, shifting the i index by 1.

90
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:51,960
So this near lower and upper diagonal is shifting y, the index in y, by 1.

91
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,960
This far lower and upper diagonal is shifting the index in x by 1.

92
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,960
So it should be divided by delta x squared.

93
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,960
All right.

94
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,960
So the way to add them,

95
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,960
we can use the same command

96
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,960
as we used to construct the lower and upper diagonals of the

97
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,960
diagonal blocks.

98
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,960
Except for the size of the matrix is going to change.

99
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,960
So now,

100
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:26,960
it's how many non-zero entries is there in the upper and lower diagonals?

101
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,960
It's now,

102
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,960
it's a lot bigger.

103
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,960
It's now nx minus 2 times ny minus 1.

104
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,960
Right?

105
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,960
So they correspond to blocks of ny minus 1 sizes.

106
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,960
And there are nx minus 2, one of them.

107
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,960
So I'll put this at 1.

108
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,960
And it's also shifted, not by 1,

109
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,960
but by ny minus 1, exactly.

110
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,960
So now, if we look at the matrix again,

111
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,960
it added an upper diagonal entry over here.

112
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,960
Right?

113
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,960
Oh, yes.

114
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,960
I forgot.

115
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,960
So let's repeat this again.

116
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,960
Just to reset.

117
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:24,960
And I need to divide by dx squared.

118
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,960
That's right.

119
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,960
So I get nines.

120
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,960
And lower diagonal,

121
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,960
I just need to put a minus sign on this.

122
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,960
Right?

123
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,960
So I get the lower diagonal again.

124
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,960
So one interesting thing to visualize the matrix is

125
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,960
a command called spy.

126
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,960
So let's spy on the matrix.

127
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,960
Okay.

128
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,960
So you get a plot of the sparsity pattern of the matrix.

129
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,960
It tells you where in the matrix it's going to be non-zero.

130
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,960
So when the matrix gets too large,

131
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,960
you won't be able to look at this again.

132
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,960
But spy can still do that.

133
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,960
So let's use an example.

134
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,960
nx is equal to 32, let's say.

135
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,960
ny is equal to 32.

136
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,960
And let's...

137
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,960
Where can I look at the command line history?

138
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,960
Now...

139
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,960
I'm going to compute this again and this again.

140
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,960
I'm going to...

141
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,960
construct the diagonal blocks.

142
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,960
And I'm going to use Kronecker product

143
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:37,960
to construct the big matrix and add lower and upper diagonals.

144
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,960
All right.

145
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,960
So I got a matrix that may be too big to look at.

146
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,960
But if I can spy on the matrix again...

147
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,960
What I get is this.

148
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,960
So...

149
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,960
So you can barely see,

150
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,960
but you can still see this upper and lower diagonal

151
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,960
that is far away.

152
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,960
And you can see, like, the middle line seems to be slightly thicker

153
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,960
than the upper and lower lines

154
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,960
because it's actually three lines.

155
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,960
You can zoom in.

156
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,960
You can zoom in and you can actually see three lines.

157
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,960
And you see the gap here.

158
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,960
Right?

159
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,960
The gap is when the grid transitions from the end

160
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,960
of one of these...

161
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,960
X columns

162
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,960
and switches to the next X column

163
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,960
starting from J equal to one.

164
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,960
All right.

165
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,960
So you don't have a coupling between this and this

166
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,960
on this row of the equation.

167
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,960
So that's...

168
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,960
what this...

169
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,960
gives you.

170
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,960
All right.
