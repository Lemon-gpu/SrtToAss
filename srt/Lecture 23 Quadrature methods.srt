1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Oh, I have a...

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I have a...

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I have a...

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I have a...

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
No, no, I...

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The other one.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yeah, I have like one of the new masks.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's like 17 dominoes.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Very small thing.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Very small thing.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Ridiculous.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So what's the deal with that thing?

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
No air, no energy?

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Yeah, it only has the...

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It only has the...

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This one at least has a hip in there.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Yeah, okay.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I feel like I'm...

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Your iPhone 7 has a new mat

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and I feel like now I have a thousand dominoes.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Okay.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Okay.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Okay.

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Okay.

25
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Okay.

26
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Okay.

27
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Okay.

28
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Okay.

29
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Okay.

30
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Okay.

31
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Okay.

32
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Have any of you looked at the videos on YouTube?

33
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Did they look okay?

34
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Did the cycle sound okay?

35
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yeah.

36
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Okay, does it read the blackboard alright?

37
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yep.

38
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
iPhone 7.

39
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's a great camera.

40
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Phone, not so much.

41
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Phone, not so much.

42
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yeah.

43
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Okay.

44
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So in this lecture we're gonna

45
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
bring together some of the pieces

46
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
in the first and the second lecture

47
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
and talk about

48
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
second kind equations.

49
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'll tell you a little bit about

50
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
these two types of equations,

51
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
but the end of this is gonna be a numerical method

52
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
that uses the Gauss projector

53
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
that we talked about last time

54
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
to solve integral equations in 2D.

55
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's a very effective technique,

56
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
very widely used in practice,

57
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
but also difficult to extend

58
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
to three dimensions.

59
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So it isn't the only topic we talk about,

60
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
but it is certainly an important one

61
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
and it's such an effective method in 2D.

62
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's good that you know about it, even though it's not a good one.

63
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Even though many of us are probably dealing with

64
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
structures for which 2D doesn't

65
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
really make a lot of physical sense.

66
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm gonna drag on that 14 for a minute.

67
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And I'm just gonna remind you,

68
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
you know, in 2D one of the things that makes it

69
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
difficult to get a handle on

70
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
the physical insight is

71
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
the 2D problem means it's infinite in the third dimension

72
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
and that means

73
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
the Green's function you're familiar with

74
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
with the potential produced by

75
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
a point charge that dies like

76
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
one over the distance turns into

77
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
this log function that was supposed to

78
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
do what you expect it to far away

79
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
or nearby, but it is

80
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
the way you get for the

81
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Green's function and what goes into the integral

82
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
when we talk about calculating

83
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
the potentials from densities.

84
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
We're thinking about the densities,

85
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
it looks like points in the 2D space

86
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
but in three dimensions it means that

87
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
each point corresponds to a long,

88
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
infinitely long, two-dimensional charge.

89
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So,

90
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
we're gonna talk a little bit about these 2D problems

91
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
in particular, we're gonna say

92
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
a little bit about, I'm just gonna remind you

93
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
how we discretize,

94
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
or one of the ways we talk about discretizing

95
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
in 2D and then by the end of this lecture

96
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
we're gonna completely

97
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
abandon this approach

98
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
even though we'll come back to it when we talk about

99
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
3D problems. So the idea

100
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
was if you're doing 2D problems

101
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
then your surface

102
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
for the 2D problem,

103
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
remember we're

104
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
imagining in the

105
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
2D problem that we have

106
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Laplace's equation outside

107
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Laplace's equation

108
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
for the potential outside is equal to zero.

109
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
We have

110
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
a boundary condition

111
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
U in infinity

112
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
goes to zero

113
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
and I apologize for the blinking

114
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
when I think it's

115
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
it keeps on persisting

116
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'll try to do something about it.

117
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And the way we're gonna try to

118
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
represent this solution

119
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
is that we're gonna put densities

120
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
on the surface

121
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
a sigma

122
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
of x where x is

123
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
element of the surface gamma

124
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
and this domain omega

125
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
is our x-serial domain

126
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
and we'll presume that we know

127
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
something like

128
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
the potential that U

129
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
for

130
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
du, dm

131
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
is given.

132
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And we're gonna

133
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
say that the potential is

134
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
equal to this integral of the density

135
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
times

136
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
the Green's function

137
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
integrated over

138
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
gamma

139
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
and that's gonna give us

140
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
this potential. So that's our

141
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
setup and the way we're gonna try to

142
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
deal with this kind of exterior

143
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
problem

144
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
is we're gonna try to solve

145
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
for the densities by making sure

146
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
they produce the potentials or their normal

147
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
derivatives and that's the given

148
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
by the equation of boundary.

149
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So that meant we represented the

150
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
density as piecewise constants on the

151
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
surface and

152
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
we wrote down a system of equations

153
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
by either co-locating

154
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
or using Galerkin methods

155
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
for most of today we're gonna be thinking about

156
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
co-location which is you think of

157
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
alpha as the weights for the base

158
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
assumptions, these piecewise constant densities

159
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
and we're gonna try to set up this system of

160
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
equations where we calculate

161
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
the density

162
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
by putting, making sure

163
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
it matches test points

164
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
and so we have a density

165
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
sigma

166
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
and we'll evaluate its potential

167
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
at some test point

168
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
u of x and we'll match it to the boundary condition

169
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
or if we're doing norming conditions

170
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
we would take the derivative of this

171
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
how would we go about

172
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
taking the derivative? The way

173
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
this is set up is I know the

174
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
potentials and I calculate the

175
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
coefficients of the

176
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
piecewise constant representation

177
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
by making sure it produces

178
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
the potentials that match given values

179
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
of test points. Suppose this is

180
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
a Neumann problem, how would I

181
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
change this in order to be able to

182
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
set up a problem where I calculate

183
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
the, instead of

184
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
matching the potential of these test points

185
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I want to match its normal derivative

186
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
what do I have to do to that system of equations?

187
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
What change do I have to make?

188
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Green's function

189
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So you can think of it as a green's function

190
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
you're gonna have to differentiate

191
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
this potential with respect to the normal

192
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
you're gonna differentiate this potential

193
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
at this point x with respect to the normal

194
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
and you can think of that

195
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
as being another

196
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
green's function which is the normal

197
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
derivative of the potential

198
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
as a function of distance

199
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
so if we're dealing with 3D

200
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
potential dies like 1 over r

201
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
the field, the normal derivative

202
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
dies like what would you expect

203
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
in 3D

204
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
if potential's dying like 1 over r

205
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
what would its normal derivative die

206
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
so we move away from point chart

207
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
1 over r squared

208
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
so we could set all this

209
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
machinery up and we could set up

210
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
a norman problem this way

211
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
we'll talk a little bit about those different

212
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
formulations but today I want to talk about

213
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
another way of thinking about this

214
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
that you use very often in 2D

215
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
that is

216
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
we're not gonna deal with the

217
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
piecewise constant

218
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
centroid co-location

219
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
we instead last time

220
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
we talked about another way

221
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
of representing integral

222
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
and that was using this idea of

223
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
a gauss quadrature algorithm

224
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
and I want to remind you a little bit about this

225
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
so why don't I want to remind you about

226
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
the integral equations

227
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
that was the set up

228
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
these are the integral equations

229
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I also wanted to remind you about a gauss quadrature

230
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
and gauss quadrature would say

231
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I evaluate an integral by using

232
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
a weighted combination with the integrands

233
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
evaluated in test points

234
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
so we have these two ideas

235
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
what gauss quadrature says

236
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
if I want to know the integral of

237
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
some function of x

238
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
integrated over dx

239
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm going to represent it as the sum of

240
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
weights

241
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
and points

242
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
so we're going to have points and weights

243
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
and we're going to figure out the points and weights

244
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
by matching higher order polynomial

245
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
so that was the idea of what we did last time

246
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
we talked about gauss quadrature

247
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
we said we're going to go ahead

248
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
and we can figure out where the points are

249
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
the points are the roots of a polynomial

250
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
and the points are

251
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
and the weights were a solution to a system of equations

252
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
that's what we did last time

253
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
so

254
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
today we're going to put these two pictures together

255
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
but we're going to have to go through a little bit of analysis first

256
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
so

257
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
we have an integral in the top picture

258
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
and we're calculating the integral

259
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
not by using points and weights

260
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
what are we doing in the top case?

261
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
we're going to do this integral by assuming it's

262
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
the integrand is piecewise constant

263
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
in the bottom case we're evaluating the integral

264
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
by points and weights

265
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
now the top one involves calculating

266
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
integrals over lines

267
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
which we can do at the bottom and do quadrature

268
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
but the question is

269
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
so we have these points and weights

270
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
doing the integral and we have this integral

271
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
that we're representing with piecewise constant lines

272
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
it seems like we ought to be able to marry these two

273
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
and in some cases you can

274
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
talk a little bit about this quadrature thing

275
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
because at the end of last time

276
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
there's sort of a punchline about these algorithms

277
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
and I wanted to look at them

278
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
by looking at a few different functions

279
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
so we're going to look at just using

280
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
this gauss quadrature scheme

281
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
this idea of using points and weights

282
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
where the points are the roots of a polynomial

283
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
and the weights are the solutions of this linear system

284
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
this does the exact for very high order polynomials

285
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
and we're going to look at the

286
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
error versus order

287
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
for these test functions

288
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
now as you look at these test functions

289
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
you'll see that I have a function

290
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
where x goes from 0 to 2 pi

291
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
and I want to ask you about these functions

292
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
what can you guess about these functions

293
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
what do you know about them

294
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
before I start writing down the plots

295
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
obviously I'm picking these five functions

296
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
because they're going to do something different

297
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
with these different quadrature schemes

298
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
and I want to point at that

299
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
and make one additional point

300
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
just as a reminder

301
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
of what we did last time

302
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
so what can you tell me about

303
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
the derivatives of these functions

304
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
do any of them have funny behaviors

305
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
when you start taking their derivatives

306
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
so what about the first one

307
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
f1, what can you tell me about the derivative of that

308
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
in particular as we go through 0

309
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
oh sorry

310
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
x goes from 0 to pi

311
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
f1 of x is

312
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
what happens to it

313
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
maybe a divergent point

314
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
somewhere in between

315
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
yeah remember the score where you take the derivative

316
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
the derivative is something to the minus one half

317
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
which means it blows something

318
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
up when the argument is 0

319
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
which it will do

320
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
so we're going to look at some of these functions

321
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I'm going to plot them first

322
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
and then I'm going to ask you about the quadrature of each of these

323
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
so here are all these functions

324
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
on this interval of 0 to 2 pi

325
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
and it just so happens

326
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I picked some of them

327
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
this one with the square root

328
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
you can see which one is the square root

329
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
which color is it

330
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
can you all see

331
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
which one is this one

332
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
that is the square root function

333
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
the one that does this

334
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
that's the blue one

335
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
it was x minus pi

336
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
and we go from

337
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
x equals 0 to 2 pi

338
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
so the argument to the square root

339
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
was going from minus pi to pi

340
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
what about these other functions

341
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
so they all have

342
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
somewhat different properties

343
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
they all look a little smoother

344
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
but they're not the same

345
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
but there are going to be some interesting things about them

346
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
and we're going to look at

347
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
just doing the quadrature algorithm

348
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
and I'm going to compare it to

349
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
this is what's called the trapezoidal rule

350
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
so the trapezoidal rule was

351
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
the midpoint rule

352
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
so you use points and weights

353
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
and it turns out when we're doing something like 0 to 2 pi

354
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
we're kind of at these endpoints

355
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
we're using a half

356
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
we can either shift around or use half weights on the end

357
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
it's equivalent

358
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
we're going to use that particular approach

359
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
to doing this, the trapezoidal rule

360
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
and then we're also going to do

361
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Gaussian quadrature

362
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
we're just going to pick it for a very high limit

363
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
so trap convergence

364
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
that was the second order method

365
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
we use the trapezoidal rule, we use the midpoints

366
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
we expect for all those functions

367
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
to go down, what do you expect the error for it to be

368
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
as you increase the number of points

369
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
if I increase the number of points

370
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
by an order of magnitude

371
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
what do I expect the error to do

372
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
if I use 10 times as many points

373
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
what's the error in the interval going to be

374
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
so again

375
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I'm just looking to see how accurately I've computed this integral

376
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
for each of those test functions

377
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
and all of them

378
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
behave roughly

379
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
like the error is second order

380
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I just use 10 times as many points

381
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
the error drops by a factor of 100

382
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
that's what you'd expect from the trapezoidal rule

383
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
this midpoint rule

384
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
one of them doesn't do that

385
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
guess which one it is

386
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
well alright two of them do it

387
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
one of them does worse

388
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
and one of them does much better

389
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
one that somebody mentioned

390
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
the one that does much better is the periodic function

391
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
there's something about the trapezoidal rule

392
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
and the periodic function

393
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
so we're going to come back to that at the very end of today's class

394
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
this one that does worse

395
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
which one is it

396
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
let me go back and look at those curves again

397
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
which of these curves do you think

398
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
didn't get that kind of second order convergence

399
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
which one would you expect to not do very well

400
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
with the midpoint rule

401
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
the square root one

402
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
yeah the square root one because it has this derivative

403
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
so it's a continuous function

404
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
but its derivative goes to infinity

405
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
and so the slope

406
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
as you go into where the square root shows up

407
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
goes to infinity

408
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
and that even messes up a simple midpoint rule

409
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
what about

410
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
the four-in-a-von

411
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
so that was the trapezoidal rule

412
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
and we don't understand why for the periodic function

413
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
it does this very fast convergence

414
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
and I'm not going to necessarily give you all the details

415
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
of why that's the case

416
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
but its second order convergence

417
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
is sort of what we expect from all these functions

418
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
now I'm going to try using the Gauss quadrature

419
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
where we pick the points and weights

420
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
to get the optimal convergence

421
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
what do you think is going to change in these curves

422
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
what are they going to look like

423
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
are they all going to get better

424
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
so here are the Gauss and quadrature points and weights

425
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
so for this interval

426
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
you can see the points

427
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
are spread out in the center

428
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
and more packed together near the sides

429
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
and the weights also have this non-uniformity

430
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
so they're spread out more in the center

431
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
and they're more heavily weighted in the center

432
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
they're more tightly packed in the ends

433
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
and they're weighted less heavily in the ends

434
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
so if we take those points and weights

435
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
for this is the Gauss-Ludon theorem

436
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
and then use that

437
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
we see the following curves

438
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
y

439
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
so obviously

440
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I didn't pick those functions at random

441
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
because you pick five

442
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
functions out of a bag

443
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
the chance that they will produce

444
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
five different convergence curves

445
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
for Gauss and Ludonga

446
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
that's a very low probability

447
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
so I've obviously

448
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
picked them very carefully

449
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
what's different about those functions

450
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
that might explain this behavior

451
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
so what do we know

452
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
should be true about Gauss-Ludonga

453
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
how fast should it converge

454
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
should it go like

455
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
if I increase the points by

456
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
an order of magnitude

457
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
do I affect

458
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
is it like n squared

459
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
is it like n cubed

460
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
is it second order, third order, fourth order

461
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
which of these curves do you expect to be like

462
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
the Gaussian Legendre

463
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
based on what we talked about last time

464
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
yeah

465
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
to rapidly

466
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
these two very rapidly decaying ones

467
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
that's spectral convergence

468
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
this is a log plot of the error

469
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
versus number of points

470
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
so if you look at the log plot

471
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
the Gauss-Ludonga

472
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
it's spectrally accurate

473
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
which means it has a curve that goes

474
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
faster and faster and faster

475
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
and that was true for only two of the functions

476
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
and not these other three

477
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
what was wrong with those other three

478
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
and why did they have three different convergence rates

479
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
so how did we get the error estimate

480
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
for Gauss-Ludonga last time

481
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
what technique did we use

482
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Taylor series

483
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Taylor series counts on

484
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
the derivatives being

485
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
bounded

486
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
now let's go back and look at those functions

487
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
now alright

488
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
so maybe the square root one

489
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
so you can figure out

490
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
the square root one with that cusp there

491
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
that's probably the one that's really converging slowly

492
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
but what about the others

493
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
the others look pretty smooth

494
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
then you have to look at the analytic form for them

495
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
and you can see the game on play

496
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I have x to the one half

497
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
you take one derivative and you get x to the minus

498
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
one half and that blows up

499
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
you take one derivative and you get x to the one half

500
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
take a second derivative and what happens to the derivative

501
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
what happens to the second derivative

502
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
for the second function

503
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
blows up two in the end

504
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
what about the third function

505
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
how many derivatives do you get to take before it blows up

506
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
you take two and the third derivative blows up

507
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
so now we go back to these functions

508
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
and you can see which is which

509
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
square root function

510
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
three halves function

511
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
five halves function

512
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
right

513
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
so you can see that the derivative is two

514
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
however many derivatives you have

515
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
that don't blow up

516
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
is the order of convergence you get with Gauss-Lavigne curve

517
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
and if the function is infinitely continuously differentiable

518
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
you get this curve

519
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
so you get this curve

520
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
and your function is really smooth

521
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
when you have a derivative discontinuity

522
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
a second derivative discontinuity

523
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
a third derivative discontinuity

524
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
and all is lost in these methods

525
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
so the really great methods

526
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
where your functions have to be really c infinitive

527
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
they have to be continuously differentiable

528
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
and if they are

529
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
and the two functions

530
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
the one that was periodic

531
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
and the one that is infinitely continuous

532
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
and differentiable but not periodic

533
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
both of them have the same function

534
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
that was just a reminder

535
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
ok so

536
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
we now have a couple things

537
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
we have a method for solving

538
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
these two dimensional integral equations

539
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
by breaking the surface up

540
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
and the piecewise constants

541
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
and then solving for

542
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
the weight

543
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
or how we can solve

544
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
how dense each of those line charges are

545
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
and we can use that to discretize

546
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
in 2D and solve

547
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
an exterior Laplace problem

548
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
we're going to talk

549
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
a little bit about

550
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
that and we're going to compare

551
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
a couple things

552
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
then the second thing we have

553
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
is this other way of calculating integrals

554
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
which maybe we could use to calculate

555
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
those line charges

556
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
and

557
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
we're going to see that we can marry

558
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
these two ideas together but only in certain

559
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
circumstances with what are called

560
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Nystrom methods and we're going to talk a little bit about that

561
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
and I'll show you an example

562
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
and this is what you're going to do the project on

563
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
on Wednesday and Thursday

564
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
afternoons, is that what we're finding the slip on?

565
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
or evenings rather?

566
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
so we're going to have one problem set

567
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
there's also a project due so

568
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
we're not going to have your hand in very much

569
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
so please come to one of the evening sessions

570
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
to do the problem set

571
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
you can probably do it there and get checked off

572
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
and then you won't have anything to hand in

573
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
so we're trying to make it so you get a chance to play with it

574
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
these ideas but not

575
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
put a lot of extra work on your queue

576
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
so I want to talk about

577
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
trying to marry these together

578
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
and I want to talk about it in the context

579
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
of thinking about certain kinds of equations

580
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
and we'll

581
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
dig into this

582
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
in a little more detail next week

583
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
we'll talk about

584
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
some more of the details of this

585
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
but for the moment I want to just get at this idea

586
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
of the difference between first and second

587
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
kind equations

588
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
and then we'll do something on second kind equations

589
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
so here's one

590
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
one

591
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
d representation of an integral equation

592
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
so I have a potential

593
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I want to solve

594
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I know it on this integral from minus one to one

595
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
and I want to calculate what the density is

596
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
and the density is plugged into

597
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
this integral whose

598
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Green's function if you want to call it that

599
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
is x minus x prime

600
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
in absolute value

601
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
so

602
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
we want to calculate the density

603
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
and we're given a potential and we want to compute

604
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
the density which we don't know

605
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
and we're going to figure out a density that gives us that potential

606
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
on this unit of infinity

607
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
so how do we do that

608
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
well we do piecewise constant centroid

609
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
collocation

610
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
bless you

611
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
let me do it again

612
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
so

613
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
the piecewise constant centroid collocation

614
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
says we

615
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
for each of these intervals

616
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
we're going to construct

617
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
a density at each of those intervals

618
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
and we're going to pick that density

619
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
so that we

620
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
satisfy this equation

621
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
that is

622
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
it gives us the potential

623
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
at these test points

624
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
and what we have to calculate

625
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
is this integral from

626
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
x j minus one

627
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
to x j

628
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
of x of

629
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
collocation of

630
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
x j minus one to x j

631
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
minus x prime

632
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
ds prime

633
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
so we're going to integrate

634
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
this line integral

635
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
we need to calculate that in order to calculate

636
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
what are these matrix entries

637
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
so we're going to have to calculate

638
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
these intervals

639
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
how do we calculate those intervals

640
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
we need to calculate those

641
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
so how should we calculate these intervals

642
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
we've got to calculate

643
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
we've got a bunch of those to calculate

644
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
we've got to calculate

645
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
how many of these do we have to calculate

646
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
what has to be true for

647
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
how many j's

648
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
for what i's

649
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
and for what j's

650
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
how many of these are going to have

651
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
to be true for each density on each line

652
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
so the density

653
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
in the jth section

654
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
it affects the potential

655
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
of how many test points

656
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
so if i imagine

657
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
i'm going to have to make this

658
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
i'm going to have to calculate

659
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
this integral

660
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
for every test point

661
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
so that's for i equals one

662
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
to n

663
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
and how many values of j

664
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
how many different

665
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
ones of these are going to be true

666
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
what is this going to have to do

667
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
so i take one section

668
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
i imagine

669
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
here's my

670
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
piecewise constant collocation scheme

671
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
here's my interval

672
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
here's my one interval

673
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
this is the jth interval

674
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
and it contributes

675
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
to all the collocation points

676
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
in the problem

677
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
including its own

678
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
so i have for each of these

679
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
intervals i'm going to have to calculate

680
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
this i'm going to have to do this

681
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
for every single interval

682
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
so i've got all these

683
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
integrals to calculate

684
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
i've got one to n

685
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
for each level

686
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
so i have how many integrals

687
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
to calculate

688
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
n, n squared and

689
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
n to the nth

690
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
so i have

691
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
how many integrals

692
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
to calculate

693
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
n to the nth

694
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
how many do you

695
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
how many vote for n squared

696
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
how many vote for n

697
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
oh good

698
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
because truth is democracy

699
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
no

700
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
ok so

701
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
we have this system of equations

702
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
that we're going to generate

703
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
and we could

704
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
calculate these integrals

705
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
how are we going to calculate these integrals

706
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
we're going to calculate these integrals

707
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
we're going to calculate these integrals

708
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
can we use the gauss quadrature scheme

709
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
for those integrals

710
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
why not

711
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
it's just an integral

712
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
it's 1d we know how to do it

713
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
is there going to be a problem

714
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
using the gauss quadrature for that integral

715
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
is that function continuous everywhere

716
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
it's an absolute value

717
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
what does it look like when you cross zero

718
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
it's like this right

719
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
so is that going to have

720
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
infinite continuous derivatives

721
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
no

722
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
the only term we have to worry about

723
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
is the self term

724
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
all the other terms it's fine

725
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
so we can use gauss quadrature

726
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
or you could probably do that one more time

727
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
ok so we calculate these integrals

728
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
then we have this charge density representation

729
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
so we're representing the density

730
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
with a weighted combination of piecewise constants

731
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
so we've got a piecewise constant

732
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
and density representation

733
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
we can go ahead and plug it into the integral

734
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
where we get

735
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
for this collocation discretization

736
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
we get

737
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
all these entries

738
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
we have each one of the entries in the matrix

739
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
takes us from one density

740
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
to one potential

741
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
so we have one column for each density value

742
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
that's taking the jth density

743
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
and calculating its potential

744
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
at all the collocation points

745
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
we have one row for each collocation point

746
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
that's the contribution of every density

747
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
to a particular collocation point

748
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
so if we imagine

749
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
we have all these entries

750
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
and we have these densities

751
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
and we have one collocation point

752
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
they all have to contribute to the collocation point

753
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
all these densities

754
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
so this is one row

755
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
and this is one column

756
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
so you can keep in mind those pictures

757
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
one column says all the dead points

758
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:24,040
one density contributes to all� lou

759
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,300
one row, all the densities contribute to all the collocation points

760
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,600
one column, one density contributes to all the collocation points

761
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,520
and one row all the density contribute to one collocation points

762
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,000
a lot

763
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,700
so that's what the matrix looks like

764
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:37,240
and now we start to refine the discretization

765
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,000
so we have this integral

766
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
we break it up into n sections

767
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
we break it up to 2n sections

768
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,100
we break it up to 4n sections

769
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,000
we break it up communauté sent all the means into a structure

770
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,000
And because we're so used to this, we expect that as we increase the number of sections,

771
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
the answer should get better.

772
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
We should converge to the correct solution.

773
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
And that isn't actually what happens.

774
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:06,000
When you solve this first kind integral equation and you refine the discretization, the answers

775
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,000
actually get worse.

776
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Why is that?

777
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,000
What's happening in this problem that causes that to occur?

778
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Well, it turns out that's just true of first kind integral equations generally.

779
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
We're going to go back and look at that a little bit more carefully, although we're

780
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
not going to focus on it too much today.

781
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
But we're going to look at another type of equation.

782
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,000
So the first kind equation is, I know the output of an integral and I want to figure

783
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
out its input.

784
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I know the potential, I want to figure out the density.

785
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Okay.

786
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,000
So there are many integral equations that turn out, come up with a different form in

787
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:55,000
which you know the potential and the density shows up both inside and outside the integral.

788
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,000
That is, the density shows up directly and also inside the integral.

789
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
This equation is called the second kind equation.

790
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
So first kind means the density shows up only in the integral.

791
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Second kind means it shows up in two ways, inside and outside the integral.

792
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
So it's a very simple equation.

793
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
You just need to look at it from a different perspective.

794
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
What do I mean by this?

795
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
You can just look at it in a different perspective.

796
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
But it's a case of a different kind of equation.

797
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
So what about this equation?

798
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
What's different?

799
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
So we go through and we say, oh, all right, we'll use our piecewise constant centroid

800
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
collocation method, even though in the first kind case it produced a method that, as we

801
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
refine the discretization, the answers did not convert.

802
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
They got worse.

803
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,000
But we're going to do it anyway and see if it works for these kinds of equations.

804
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
And what we see is there's one extra piece to this.

805
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Okay.

806
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:47,340
to this, which is because the density shows up outside, as well as inside the integral

807
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:53,340
equation, we see this sigma ni, the self-term, showing up along with the summation.

808
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:57,240
So all the rest of this looks just like the first kind of equation, and the only extra

809
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,560
piece is the sigma ni.

810
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:05,300
When I write down the matrix that represents the linear system I'm going to solve to compute

811
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:08,080
those coefficients, what's going to change?

812
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,680
What will be different?

813
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:18,600
So this is exactly the same matrix we set up for the first kind of equation.

814
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:24,220
Each column corresponds to the contribution of a density to all the collocation points.

815
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:31,460
Each row corresponds to the contributions of all the densities to a given collocation

816
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:31,820
point.

817
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:36,280
And the extra piece that the second kind of equation added to it is what?

818
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,080
Just these ones.

819
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:47,080
And that's because the second kind of equation had the density showing up both outside the

820
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:51,040
integral equation and inside the integral equation.

821
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,260
So what happens in this case when we find the discretization?

822
00:34:54,260 --> 00:35:00,140
Well, and it's really hard to see in this picture, as you increase the order the answers

823
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,260
get better and better.

824
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:04,260
It converges.

825
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:07,400
The first kind of equation didn't converge.

826
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:07,760
It converges.

827
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:07,880
It converges.

828
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,380
It converges.

829
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:08,880
It converges.

830
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,380
It converges.

831
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:13,820
So we're going to think a little bit about how this happened now, and then we're going

832
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,400
to try to take advantage of that.

833
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:23,100
So the question is, of course, the ones you probably think of or the ones you know are

834
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:26,440
I know the potential, and I want to calculate the density.

835
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,880
These are the ones that often come up when you write them down physically in 3D.

836
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:34,800
But there are other kinds of formulations of those problems that generate second kind

837
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,560
equations, and we're going to do that in a moment.

838
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:48,180
So we need to think about what this integral operator does, and we're going to try to develop

839
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,180
some intuition.

840
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:52,340
I'm not going to be very formal, but I'm going to try to give you some intuition about what's

841
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,280
going on.

842
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:58,040
So what does the integral operator do?

843
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:03,040
When you put something into an integral, you really only get to see what's under the curve.

844
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:09,920
So the area under the curve is kind of an averaging of a function.

845
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:16,660
So we might imagine that this integral operator actually takes lots of functions and produces

846
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:19,240
the same output.

847
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:23,340
If that were a linear system, we'd think of it as being singular, and it is true and singular

848
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,860
in the case of this integral operator.

849
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:32,200
That is, if I imagine a function that is non-zero only at one point, and I put it inside an

850
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:32,980
integral.

851
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:38,280
So instead the term is multiplied by, it doesn't blow up, it doesn't go to infinity, then the

852
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,280
output is zero.

853
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:44,320
The area under the curve for a function like this is zero.

854
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:49,040
So imagine I have a line, and then I put all these needles on it.

855
00:36:49,040 --> 00:37:01,040
So imagine, I don't know, imagine a porcupine compared to an armadillo.

856
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,960
One has a smooth surface.

857
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,880
So these methods can't tell the difference between the two, because the porcupine has

858
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,300
quills, and these quills have no area under them.

859
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:14,200
So from an integral operator, you can't tell the difference between a porcupine and an armadillo.

860
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,140
You can, if you pick it up, you get stuck.

861
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:24,240
And that's sort of the problem, is that when you look at this, you have all these functions.

862
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:30,520
So if I come up with a density that satisfies my integral equation, that is, produces an

863
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,520
output.

864
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,460
And I also have, so if I've got a density that satisfies my integral equation, and I

865
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:43,840
also have all these densities, all these quills, if you like, that I can add to my function,

866
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:47,580
and I can still satisfy the integral equation, because once I plug them into the integral,

867
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,140
they come out as zero.

868
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:54,700
It means if I've got one solution, I have an infinite number of solutions.

869
00:37:54,700 --> 00:38:01,960
So that's why in 1D, when we refine the discretization, we're getting the same thing.

870
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,960
Right?

871
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:07,800
And we're getting this problem that when we do this collocation operation, and we start

872
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:14,480
to refine the discretization, we discover that we're picking up the case of the quills.

873
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:21,720
So we're, imagine taking an integral and making it into shorter and shorter integrals.

874
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:30,840
So we're taking this interval, and we're basically taking these boxcars, and when we refine the

875
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,960
discretization, we take those quills.

876
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:40,460
We take those boxcars and we make them into smaller boxcars.

877
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:42,960
And even smaller boxcars.

878
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:55,700
And as we go down in the discretization, we're getting closer and closer to these functions

879
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:59,140
which are one point, but they're non-zero.

880
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,960
The two quills.

881
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,960
Right?

882
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:02,960
So we have a bunch of them.

883
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,960
And we have lots of them.

884
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,960
Right?

885
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,960
They can be anywhere.

886
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,960
We can have one here in the middle.

887
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,960
We can put a quill, we can put lots and lots of them.

888
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,960
In fact there are an infinite number of them.

889
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:21,960
So we're going to need to be, in a few minutes, a little bit more formal about it, and what

890
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:26,960
we're going to think about is k, the operator, the integral operator, takes functions to

891
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,960
functions.

892
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:31,960
k with an underbar under it takes vectors to vectors.

893
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:36,960
And we're going to have to be a little careful about that because when we do the discretization,

894
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,460
we're going to worry about whether we're talking about the operator, the operator applied to

895
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:45,960
piecewise constant representations, or actually the matrix.

896
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:50,460
So let's have a look at what happens.

897
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:57,420
So we're going to look at the matrix and see what happens as we start to refine the discretization.

898
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:00,960
So it's a little bit hard to see here, but what's happening is when n equals 10, you're

899
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,960
going to have 10 eigenvalues of that matrix.

900
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:07,960
That's the collocation matrix.

901
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,960
So imagine, calculate the eigenvalues when n equals 10.

902
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,960
Calculate the eigenvalues when n equals 20, you'll get 20 of them.

903
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,960
Calculate the eigenvalues when n equals 40, then you'll have 40 eigenvalues.

904
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,460
And then plot them all together.

905
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:28,960
And you'll see that when n equals 10, the first 10 eigenvalues go from somewhere around

906
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,960
2 or 3 down to, I don't know, 10.

907
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,960
So you'll see that when n equals 10, you'll have 10 eigenvalues.

908
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,960
10 to the minus 2.

909
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,960
And then when n equals 20, it goes down a little further.

910
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,960
And then when n equals 40, they go down a little further.

911
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:42,960
And as we refine the discretization more and more, what's happening in the eigenvalues

912
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,960
is they're going closer and closer to 0.

913
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:50,960
So the more you refine the discretization, not only are the eigenvalues going to 0, there

914
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,960
are more and more of them.

915
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:58,960
So if you infinitely refine the discretization, you end up with an infinite number of 0 eigenvalues,

916
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,960
which means the matrix is infinite.

917
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:03,960
And the matrix is incredibly singular.

918
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:09,960
So that's what goes wrong when we try to converge this problem.

919
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:15,960
So what do you think happens to the eigenvalue picture when we go to the second kind of question?

920
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:19,960
What happens to the eigenvalues of a matrix when you add the identity to it?

921
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:37,960
So how many of you know the spectral mapping theorem?

922
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,960
Have you heard the spectral mapping theorem?

923
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,960
The most useful theorem you'll ever learn.

924
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:48,960
It says if I take a function of a matrix, if I want to know the eigenvalues of a function

925
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:53,960
of a matrix, it's the function of the eigenvalues of the original matrix.

926
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:58,960
And that works for any analytic function, any function you can represent with a Taylor series.

927
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:11,960
So if we have i plus a, then the eigenvalues of i plus a equal the eigenvalues of a with

928
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,960
the 1 interval.

929
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,960
This is a function of a matrix.

930
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,960
We're adding the identity to it.

931
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:22,960
And it says that the eigenvalues of this matrix are the same function adding 1 to it to the

932
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,960
eigenvalues.

933
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,960
What happens if I add 1 to those eigenvalues?

934
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,960
Do they go to the 0 anymore?

935
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,960
So now we have this problem.

936
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:39,960
Our first kind of integral equation generates a matrix that is progressively worse conditioned.

937
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,960
And we see it because the eigenvalues are approaching 0.

938
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,960
And the other way to see it is to think of this discretization, this progressively refined

939
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:53,960
discretization, where as we increase the number of sections we're breaking the interval into,

940
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:57,960
they get thinner and thinner and they start to look like needles, like quills.

941
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:01,960
These things that when you put them into an integral you get 0 out of them.

942
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,960
So that's the intuition.

943
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:11,960
And then the great thing about the second kind of equation is it's the same operator plus the identity.

944
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:16,960
Which means all those eigenvalues that are accumulating around 0, what are they going to accumulate around?

945
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,960
1.

946
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:26,960
So what does that mean about the second kind of equation as you refine the discretization?

947
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:34,960
Does it get worse conditioned as you refine the discretization for the second kind of equation?

948
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,960
So what are all the eigenvalues?

949
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,960
So I keep refining and refining.

950
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,960
Finding elements, finding value methods.

951
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,960
What happens as you refine the discretization?

952
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,960
What happens to the matrix?

953
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,960
It gets worse conditioned.

954
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,960
And worse and worse and worse.

955
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,960
Second kind of internal equations, what happens when you refine the discretization?

956
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,960
The operator has eigenvalues that approach 0 and then it's shifted by 1.

957
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:04,960
So it doesn't matter how fine you make the discretization, the second kind of integral equations in fact don't convert.

958
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:11,960
And the way to think about it is when you have the identity plus k applied to a smooth function plus a quill,

959
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:16,960
what comes out, the quill still shows up because it shows up through the identity operator.

960
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:24,960
So that means second kind operator identity plus k can tell the difference between an armadillo and a porcupine.

961
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,960
And you, you have to pick them up.

962
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:38,960
So that simple intuition is behind why when we look at the eigenvalues of the second kind integral equation

963
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:43,960
and we increase the discretization, the first ten, well, the first few are wherever they are.

964
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:49,960
Then, and then the next ten, well, they're by that point really close to 0.

965
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:53,960
And then after that, they all just, all the operator eigenvalues are close to 0,

966
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,960
which means the second kind operator, they're all really close to 0.

967
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:56,960
So that's the first kind of integral equation.

968
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,960
The second kind of integral equation is always close to 1.

969
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:06,960
So if I apply something like a Krylov subspace method to this problem, how badly conditioned is it?

970
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,960
How fast is that going to convert?

971
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,960
Is this an ill-conditioned matrix ever?

972
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:16,960
No matter how fine you make the discretization?

973
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,960
No, it's the second kind integral equation.

974
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:23,960
It's always well conditioned.

975
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,960
Almost.

976
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:32,960
So, we're going to look at some issues about the first eigenvalues, and we'll talk about that in a moment.

977
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:37,960
So, we're going to look a little bit at this theory,

978
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:41,960
and I'm not going to go through the theory in that much detail here in class.

979
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:47,960
I'm going to flip through a bunch of the slides and leave the notes for you on the website.

980
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:52,960
There are a lot of details about tracking the differences between what's the integral operator,

981
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,960
what's the integral operator applied to these basis functions,

982
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,960
and what's actually the matrix.

983
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,960
And we're going to need to track that carefully,

984
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:05,960
and I'm going to sort of wave my hands over some of those details and let you read them,

985
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:08,960
because it's just not that interesting to watch in class.

986
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,960
But you can look at the details, you can go through them,

987
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:15,960
but it's not a good class to exercise.

988
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:19,960
So, we're going to come up with three things.

989
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,960
We have the matrix, which has a bar underneath it.

990
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,960
We have the operator, which has nothing next to it.

991
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:24,960
And the matrix.

992
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:29,960
And the operator applied to a piecewise constant discretization with n basis functions.

993
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:32,960
So we've got these three different operators.

994
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:39,960
And we're going to try to do that so that we can compare the discretization of piecewise constant density

995
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:43,960
to the original operator and write down the difference between them.

996
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:47,960
And that's really what we're going to try to show.

997
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:53,960
We can write down, if we represent the density as a weighted combination of basis functions,

998
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:57,960
where the basis functions in this case were orthogonal.

999
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:01,960
Are the piecewise constant basis functions orthogonal?

1000
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:05,960
If I have two functions, one that looks like this,

1001
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:10,960
and another one that looks like the second case, a shifted pulse,

1002
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:16,960
are these orthogonal to each other?

1003
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,960
Is the integral of basis one times basis two,

1004
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:28,960
equal to zero?

1005
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,960
If I take the product of these two and integrate, is their result zero?

1006
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:33,960
Yeah.

1007
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,960
Okay, so these are orthogonal.

1008
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:38,960
If I start to do rooftop basis functions, they won't be.

1009
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,960
But we're going to assume that just because it makes it a little easier to think about

1010
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,960
how to do things like projecting.

1011
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,960
So we can project a given density onto the basis function

1012
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,960
just by projecting it onto the orthogonal basis.

1013
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:52,960
You don't have to set up a system equation.

1014
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,960
You just project.

1015
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,960
And once we've done that, once we've done this projection,

1016
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:02,960
we can then think about writing down the integral operator in terms of these projections.

1017
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,960
And this is the point where I'm going to wave my hands,

1018
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,960
because at this point you can go through the details of this,

1019
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:12,960
but what we're trying to do is to see some way of comparing the exact integral operator

1020
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:17,960
to what we get when we introduce this piecewise constant density discretization.

1021
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,960
And we're going to see that we get this projection,

1022
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,960
and we're going to have to keep track of that.

1023
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:29,960
But what we get out of this is that we have a representation of,

1024
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:33,960
if we start with a density that's piecewise constant,

1025
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,960
it's a density that's defined everywhere.

1026
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,960
We have an operator that's defined everywhere.

1027
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:39,960
This is not the matrix.

1028
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:44,960
Now it takes a piecewise constant density, which is defined over space,

1029
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,960
and maps it into a potential that's defined over space,

1030
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:51,960
and set it equal to a set of another potential that's piecewise constant.

1031
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,960
These are all functions of space.

1032
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:59,960
We can then compare the two, and we can ask the question.

1033
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:05,960
So if we start with a second kind integral operator,

1034
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:08,960
and then we introduce a discretization,

1035
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:14,960
so that the piecewise constant discretization,

1036
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,960
and we say that the original integral operator is solvable,

1037
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,960
so we say that I plus K inverse is,

1038
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,960
is bounded.

1039
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,960
That means there really is a solution to the second kind integral operator.

1040
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,960
If there is one,

1041
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,960
and we also describe the discrete equivalent,

1042
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,960
that is, we introduce a piecewise constant density,

1043
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,960
and come up with a discrete operator,

1044
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,960
we get these two things.

1045
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:44,960
If we have consistency,

1046
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,960
meaning if the continuous operator

1047
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:50,960
and the operator projected onto the discrete basis set,

1048
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,960
if they apply to any test density,

1049
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:54,960
goes to zero,

1050
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,960
that just says the two operators,

1051
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,960
the discrete and the continuous one,

1052
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,960
do the same thing as the n goes to infinity,

1053
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,960
if it goes to zero,

1054
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:06,960
and we do the same thing with the right-hand side,

1055
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:11,960
then the discretization converges.

1056
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:16,960
So that's all we need.

1057
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:17,960
Now to prove that,

1058
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:18,960
it's a collection of steps,

1059
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,960
and I'm not going to try to drag you through this,

1060
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,960
but I'm going to try to get you through it.

1061
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,960
And it has a collection of technical points,

1062
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,960
many of which are,

1063
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,960
sort of get us lost in the details.

1064
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:35,960
What I want to say is this.

1065
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:42,960
As long as your representation of the integral operator converges,

1066
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,960
that is, it will give you the same result

1067
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,960
as the original integral operator

1068
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,960
when you refine,

1069
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:50,960
that is,

1070
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,960
as long as you have a way of evaluating the integral that's accurate,

1071
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,960
and gets progressively more accurate,

1072
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,960
then the density will converge.

1073
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:01,960
And the accuracy with which you represent the integral operator,

1074
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,960
the rate within that it converges,

1075
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:06,960
will be the same as the way the density converges.

1076
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,960
So, what does this mean?

1077
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:13,960
So, I didn't take you through the details.

1078
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:18,960
It says that if I have a second-count integral equation,

1079
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,960
and I accurately compute the number of points,

1080
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,960
and I accurately compute the integrals

1081
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,960
in the second-count integral equation,

1082
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,960
that's all I have to do.

1083
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,960
As long as I've computed those integrals accurately,

1084
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:30,960
I will get convergence,

1085
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,960
and the rate at which the thing will converge

1086
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,960
is dependent entirely on the rate at which

1087
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,960
the evaluation of the integral converges.

1088
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,960
With that in mind,

1089
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,960
what method should you use to evaluate the integral?

1090
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:49,960
The Gauss plot of the curve.

1091
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,960
Yeah, the Gauss plot of the curve.

1092
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:54,960
Because that gives us exponential convergence.

1093
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,960
That means if we're solving a second-count integral equation,

1094
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:02,960
we should get exponential convergence for the integral equation.

1095
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:06,960
So, this is the thing about second-count equations.

1096
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,960
This is what is so amazing about them,

1097
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,960
and why for years they were very popular,

1098
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:17,960
until the problem with the dense matrices they generated

1099
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:18,960
became an issue,

1100
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,960
and then we switched to methods that produced sparse matrices.

1101
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:23,960
And now we have other methods with sparse Y and Bs,

1102
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:25,960
so we use them again too.

1103
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:28,960
But let's try this out.

1104
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,960
Right, so this is what we're going to do.

1105
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:33,960
We're going to say we have an integral equation.

1106
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,960
We have a second-count integral equation,

1107
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:39,960
and we're going to apply a quadrature to the collocation equation.

1108
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:40,960
So here are my collocation equations.

1109
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,960
Here's my test point, XI,

1110
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,960
here's my Green's function, my unknown density,

1111
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,960
and we're going to replace this integral

1112
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,960
with a graph.

1113
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,960
So we have a quadrature approximation.

1114
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:51,960
We have the evaluation points,

1115
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,960
X prime gets replaced by XK,

1116
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,960
the weights for that quadrature point,

1117
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:59,960
and remember, XI is the collocation point.

1118
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,960
So all we did was to say,

1119
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,960
let's do the integral equation,

1120
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:07,960
let's say we don't know what the density is,

1121
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:09,960
but we can write down what that integral operator is

1122
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:13,960
using the quadrature scheme.

1123
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:16,960
So can I just solve this?

1124
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,960
Well, I got two things.

1125
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,960
I've got, I need the density of the collocation points,

1126
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,960
and I also need the density of the quadrature points.

1127
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,960
Then I only have, so I can pick with n collocation points,

1128
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,960
I can get n equations,

1129
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,960
but I have two n unknowns.

1130
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,960
The density of the quadrature points,

1131
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:37,960
which I have n,

1132
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:40,960
and the density of the collocation points,

1133
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:44,960
which I have another n.

1134
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,960
So,

1135
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:52,960
what should I do?

1136
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:58,960
Where should I put the quadrature points?

1137
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:09,960
So suppose now I decide,

1138
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:14,960
I have this surface.

1139
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:15,960
I have the density on this surface,

1140
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:16,960
sigma of X,

1141
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,960
and I'm going to calculate,

1142
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,960
and I know the potential.

1143
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,960
I know the potential,

1144
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,960
psi of X,

1145
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,960
for X elements of the surface.

1146
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:31,960
And now I say that the potential at X

1147
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:33,960
is given by the density at X

1148
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:36,960
plus this integral

1149
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,960
of some g of X,

1150
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:39,960
comma X bar,

1151
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:41,960
of the density of X bar,

1152
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:44,960
integrated over this gamma.

1153
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,960
Now I say I'm going to do this,

1154
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,960
I'm going to replace this

1155
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,960
with a quadrature representation.

1156
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,960
A sum of w i's,

1157
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,960
g of w j,

1158
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,960
so g of X i,

1159
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,960
comma X j,

1160
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:03,960
sigma of X j,

1161
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:07,960
plus sigma of X i,

1162
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:10,960
is equal to the potential of X i.

1163
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,960
So I'm picking a particular point,

1164
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:15,960
sigma of X i,

1165
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,960
and I'm saying now we're going to pick

1166
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:21,960
these quadrature points

1167
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:24,960
to evaluate the integral.

1168
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,960
And the problem is I have all these test points

1169
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:35,960
and all these quadrature points.

1170
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:38,960
So for each of my collocation equations,

1171
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:44,960
of which I have n,

1172
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:48,960
and for each of my quadrature points,

1173
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:56,960
j equals one to n,

1174
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:01,960
I have n equations in 2n unknowns.

1175
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,960
How can I fix this?

1176
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,960
How can I get it so that I have

1177
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:09,960
only one set of equations?

1178
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:10,960
Well, one set of unknowns?

1179
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,960
I have one set of equations.

1180
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,960
How do I get one set of unknowns?

1181
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,960
You can make the quadrature points

1182
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:18,960
from inside the...

1183
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:19,960
No, you can't.

1184
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,960
You want to put the quadrature points in...

1185
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:22,960
You want to make the quadrature points

1186
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:23,960
and the collocation points

1187
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:25,960
be the same points?

1188
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:26,960
Yeah, but how do we pick

1189
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,960
the collocation points?

1190
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:29,960
What was the rule for picking

1191
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:33,960
the collocation points?

1192
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:34,960
We had a rule for picking

1193
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,960
the collocation points, didn't we?

1194
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:39,960
Well, we had this idea that if you broke it

1195
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:40,960
into piecewise straight sections,

1196
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,960
you should pick the midpoint

1197
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,960
or the endpoint or something like that.

1198
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,960
All right, maybe it's okay.

1199
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:48,960
I have a very good way of picking

1200
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:49,960
the collocation points.

1201
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:50,960
Why not make them equal

1202
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,960
to the quadrature points?

1203
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:59,960
If we do that, what do we get?

1204
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:04,960
If you did this in somewhere in the 1800s,

1205
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,960
you'd get to name the method.

1206
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,960
So if you say,

1207
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:13,960
we've got these collocation points,

1208
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:14,960
and we've got the collocation points

1209
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:15,960
and the quadrature points,

1210
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:16,960
and they're the same.

1211
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,960
If we set them equal to each other,

1212
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:21,960
you get a method that's referred to

1213
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:27,960
as the Nystrom method.

1214
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:29,960
We just go ahead and say,

1215
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:31,960
we'll use as the quadrature points,

1216
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:36,960
we'll just make them the same.

1217
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,960
So we're going to co-locate

1218
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:42,960
the quadrature and collocation points.

1219
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:50,960
Because we've got a very good way

1220
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,960
of picking the collocation points anyway.

1221
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,960
Why not make them the same?

1222
00:57:54,960 --> 00:58:01,960
It gives us a set of n equations and unknowns.

1223
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,960
If we do that,

1224
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:06,960
we're still evaluating the integrals

1225
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:09,960
spectrally accurately.

1226
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:10,960
And what does that mean

1227
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,960
is the convergence of these methods.

1228
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:19,960
So here's the other thing.

1229
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:22,960
So the first time you tell this to a student,

1230
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,960
after, so I used to give out a problem set

1231
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:25,960
where everybody would have to calculate

1232
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:27,960
these line integrals,

1233
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:28,960
and then I'd show them the Nystrom method

1234
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:29,960
and say, well look,

1235
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:30,960
you know all that time you spent

1236
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:31,960
doing those line integrals?

1237
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:32,960
Well that was a waste of time

1238
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:33,960
because you could just give them

1239
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:34,960
the Nystrom methods,

1240
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,960
in which case you only need points and weights.

1241
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:40,960
And oh, that would make people furious.

1242
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,960
So I stopped doing it.

1243
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:46,960
Well it's good for you to calculate integrals

1244
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:49,960
over lines, although maybe not that good.

1245
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:53,960
But not only is the method spectrally accurate,

1246
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:55,960
the piecewise constant collocation,

1247
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:58,960
this is at best a second order method.

1248
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:03,960
The Nystrom method, it's spectrally accurate.

1249
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:06,960
That means when we refine the discretization

1250
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,960
and we look at how well we're converging,

1251
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:11,960
and compare it to piecewise constant collocation,

1252
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:16,960
we get, we'll get a method,

1253
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:18,960
because of the spectral accuracy

1254
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:20,960
of our representation of the integral operator

1255
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:21,960
because of that theorem,

1256
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:23,960
we'll get something that converges

1257
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,960
spectrally accurate.

1258
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:27,960
So here's a Nystrom method

1259
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:30,960
applied to an integral equation.

1260
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,960
And we're looking at the top curve,

1261
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:33,960
which you can barely see it in the curve,

1262
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:35,960
is the piecewise constant collocation scheme

1263
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:38,960
where we broke it up into 4 through 11 integrals.

1264
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,960
And then we did the Gauss-Cobb-Zern-Nystrom

1265
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:42,960
method.

1266
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,960
And by 11 integrals,

1267
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:45,960
we're almost at machine precision

1268
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:46,960
for the Nystrom method.

1269
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,960
And for the piecewise constant collocation,

1270
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:55,960
we barely got the error down to 10%.

1271
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:59,960
But I did something here

1272
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,960
and made it different than the original Green's function.

1273
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:04,960
What did I do?

1274
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:05,960
Why is this Green's function different

1275
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:09,960
from the one I started the lecture with?

1276
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:10,960
Remember the one at the beginning of the lecture?

1277
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:11,960
What Green's function?

1278
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:14,960
It was x minus x prime and absolute value.

1279
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:17,960
And I've changed it to be x minus x prime squared.

1280
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:19,960
Why did I do that?

1281
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:22,960
Because the curve with absolute value

1282
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:25,960
that has a discontinuity in it,

1283
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:28,960
and when you have an integral with a discontinuity in it,

1284
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:31,960
what's true about Gauss-Cobb's curve?

1285
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:33,960
You lose the spectral convergence.

1286
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:37,960
All right, so I used a little sleight of hand

1287
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:40,960
to get the integral to be the same.

1288
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:43,960
I picked the example very carefully.

1289
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:45,960
So the question is now,

1290
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:47,960
is that a practical method?

1291
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:50,960
So we now have this Nystrom method,

1292
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,960
which has exponential convergence.

1293
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,960
And the answer is,

1294
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:55,960
if it has exponential convergence

1295
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:57,960
for non-singular kernels,

1296
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,960
why don't we use it always?

1297
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:01,960
Why don't we teach you anything other than,

1298
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:02,960
why don't we start this lecture

1299
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:03,960
with the first overview

1300
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:04,960
when we talk about panels

1301
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:05,960
and integrating over panels?

1302
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:06,960
Why don't we use it always?

1303
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:07,960
Why don't we use it always?

1304
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:08,960
Why don't we use it always?

1305
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:09,960
Why don't we use it always?

1306
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:10,960
Because it's really good because

1307
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:12,960
it's because most physical problems

1308
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,960
and interests have singular integrals,

1309
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:15,960
singular kernels.

1310
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:17,960
One over r is like a r over r

1311
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:19,960
if you're doing Helmholtz problems.

1312
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:20,960
So, if you're going to match potential

1313
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,960
flow or most of the physical problems,

1314
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,960
you're interested in Laplace's equation,

1315
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:25,960
Helmholtz's equation,

1316
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:27,960
that's the one the PDEs have integrals,

1317
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:29,960
have kernels,

1318
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:31,960
the thing that goes inside the integral.

1319
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:33,960
They do have singularities in them,

1320
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:36,960
which means these Nystrom methods don't work.

1321
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:38,960
Well,

1322
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:46,200
So we're going to stop here and then I'm going to talk a little bit about one

1323
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:51,000
particular case. I'm going to show you a little bit of the details of this in

1324
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:58,900
order to give you a sense of the fact that there are interesting interval operators that do,

1325
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:02,900
for which this is the case.

1326
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:07,900
And we'll do this as part of the project.

1327
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:17,900
So when we think about trying to solve an integral equation, imagine in 2D, bless you,

1328
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:23,900
we're trying to solve a Dirichlet problem. So we imagine that we know the potential at

1329
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:29,900
each point x and it's given to us by an integral of now the 2D Green function,

1330
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:36,900
which I'm going to write as x prime and sigma of x prime d gamma.

1331
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:38,900
So we're going to think of this as,

1332
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:38,940
well, we're going to think of this as a,

1333
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:44,940
we have the pluses equation outside and we want to know the density and we know,

1334
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:51,940
we know the potential on the surface.

1335
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:59,940
And we're trying to solve this problem. This is the Dirichlet problem.

1336
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:13,940
So what kind is this? Is this first kind or second kind?

1337
01:03:13,940 --> 01:03:16,940
So this is first kind.

1338
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:33,940
So we're not going to be able to use our Easter method for the first kind equation because one,

1339
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:38,940
it's only the second kind for which we have that area about the quadr- the,

1340
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:44,940
the integral equation solution picking up the same asymptotic behavior as the,

1341
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:50,940
or the same accuracy as the quadrature. So we can't use it for a first kind equation.

1342
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:53,940
So we're not going to be able to solve this Dirichlet problem.

1343
01:03:53,940 --> 01:04:03,940
What about a Neumann problem? Suppose I have the same interval, the same equation,

1344
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:07,940
and instead I have partial psi, partial n.

1345
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:11,940
And then, it's given, and x is given.

1346
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:23,940
What's the integral equation I write down then?

1347
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:28,940
Well, it's still true that potential is given by the screen function,

1348
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:31,940
multiplied by density.

1349
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:36,940
Except I don't know what this is.

1350
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:41,940
So how can I turn that equation into one that I can use for the Neumann problem?

1351
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:44,940
What could I do?

1352
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:46,940
So here's my Neumann problem.

1353
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:55,940
Just differentiate the whole thing.

1354
01:04:55,940 --> 01:04:58,940
You could differentiate the whole thing. Alright, so let's differentiate the whole thing.

1355
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:02,940
So we're going to calculate d by the n of psi of x.

1356
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:05,940
And we're going to note that this is the n of x.

1357
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:07,940
And we're going to keep track of that.

1358
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:09,940
And we're going to leave that in the moment.

1359
01:05:22,940 --> 01:05:24,940
So is that helping us at all?

1360
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:26,940
What is this thing?

1361
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:30,940
Can I pull the dn dx inside the integral?

1362
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:36,940
Yes.

1363
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:38,940
Can you?

1364
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:40,940
The integration is over a different variable.

1365
01:05:40,940 --> 01:05:41,940
Say again?

1366
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:43,940
The integration is over a different variable.

1367
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:45,940
The integration is over a different variable.

1368
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:47,940
So can I pull that inside?

1369
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:49,940
If I do, what does it mean?

1370
01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:52,940
So I can pull that normal derivative inside.

1371
01:05:52,940 --> 01:05:55,940
But then, what happens to it?

1372
01:05:55,940 --> 01:05:58,940
You have 3n of...

1373
01:05:58,940 --> 01:05:59,940
So now, let's...

1374
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:02,940
Let's imagine what that potential looks like.

1375
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:05,940
And see if we can think out what it might look like.

1376
01:06:19,940 --> 01:06:23,940
So I might expect that if I write down the potential,

1377
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:25,940
as I approach a density...

1378
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:28,940
So I'm approaching... I want to know what the potential looks like.

1379
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:31,940
As I approach this density.

1380
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:37,940
What do I expect the potential to look like as I approach this density?

1381
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:42,940
In 3D, it's easy to think about.

1382
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:45,940
So let's think about it in 3D.

1383
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:49,940
And we can get some intuition from 3D.

1384
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:53,940
And then I'll stop there and we'll do it a little bit more precisely at the beginning of next class.

1385
01:06:55,940 --> 01:06:57,940
What do you think it would look like in 3D?

1386
01:06:57,940 --> 01:06:58,940
So remember that...

1387
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:00,940
I have this density.

1388
01:07:00,940 --> 01:07:05,940
And now this potential is equal to the integral of that density.

1389
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:09,940
x prime divided by x minus x prime.

1390
01:07:09,940 --> 01:07:12,940
Integrated over some shortage.

1391
01:07:12,940 --> 01:07:16,940
Say, x1 to x2.

1392
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:22,940
If I plot this potential...

1393
01:07:22,940 --> 01:07:26,940
...

1394
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:28,940
I can get the potential here.

1395
01:07:28,940 --> 01:07:30,940
So I can look at the potential...

1396
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:31,940
Now, let's see...

1397
01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:32,940
Let's use a different variable here.

1398
01:07:32,940 --> 01:07:33,940
R, where R is...

1399
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:35,940
We're just going to look at the potential on this line, R.

1400
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:40,940
And where R is equal to zero, that's where this line is.

1401
01:07:40,940 --> 01:07:44,940
Although, if we're thinking about it now in 3D, that's not a line.

1402
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:46,940
Oh, I just want to say one.

1403
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:49,940
So here's my charge panel.

1404
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:50,940
I'm asking...

1405
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:52,940
I'm looking at the potential as I approach this line.

1406
01:07:52,940 --> 01:07:55,940
Yeah, then you went off that time, didn't you?

1407
01:07:55,940 --> 01:08:00,420
So we go, we're approaching this charge, and then we're coming out the other side.

1408
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:02,840
If I plot that potential, what's it going to look like?

1409
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:08,460
So suppose this is a positive charge.

1410
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:14,980
Then on, if I hold it this way, so on the right side, what's the potential going to be?

1411
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,060
Is it going to be positive or negative?

1412
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:20,700
If it's a positive charge, I'm looking at the potential as I move away from the panel.

1413
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:22,820
Is the potential positive or negative?

1414
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:24,760
Positive.

1415
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:25,320
Positive.

1416
01:08:26,140 --> 01:08:29,180
If I'm looking on the left side and I plot the potential, what's it going to do?

1417
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:30,300
Is it going to be positive or negative?

1418
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:31,160
Positive.

1419
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:31,880
Positive.

1420
01:08:32,340 --> 01:08:34,560
And in both directions, it's going to do what?

1421
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:35,380
Go up or go down?

1422
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:36,240
Down.

1423
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:37,020
Down.

1424
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:42,180
Right, so this is, again, in 3D, this is what the potential is going to look like.

1425
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:47,400
It's not going to blow up as we actually approach this charge density sheet.

1426
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:53,500
That we proved in the very first lecture by calculating out a hole in it.

1427
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:55,000
So if that's a...

1428
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:01,820
So if that's a plot of the potential as you approach this surface, what does the derivative

1429
01:09:01,820 --> 01:09:03,600
of the potential look like?

1430
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:11,200
So what's it going to do?

1431
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:16,260
As r is increasing, as I approach the panel, as r increasing, what's happening?

1432
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:17,260
The potential is increasing.

1433
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:19,200
What happens to its normal...

1434
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:21,300
The derivative in the normal direction?

1435
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:22,680
Now I have to pick which direction is normal.

1436
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:24,320
So let's say the normal direction is in the normal direction.

1437
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:24,400
Okay.

1438
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:24,580
So what happens if the derivative is in the normal direction?

1439
01:09:24,580 --> 01:09:24,700
Now I have to pick which direction is normal.

1440
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:25,440
So what happens if the derivative is in the positive?

1441
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:27,300
What happens to this?

1442
01:09:27,460 --> 01:09:28,720
So this is the normal.

1443
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:34,320
So what happens when I take the derivative of this potential in that normal direction?

1444
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:39,960
Is it increasing or decreasing?

1445
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:40,400
Is it going...

1446
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:41,780
So now I have to be a little careful.

1447
01:09:41,780 --> 01:09:45,080
So we're talking about perturbing it in the normal direction.

1448
01:09:45,740 --> 01:09:45,940
Right?

1449
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:50,360
So we're going to ask what happens when we look at the derivative potentials

1450
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:52,200
and point a little bit in the normal direction.

1451
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:54,700
So we're going to take the difference between the two.

1452
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:58,580
So if we look at that, it looks like it goes up.

1453
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:01,780
The slope here is infinite.

1454
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:03,800
It goes to some finite value.

1455
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:06,880
Then what happens after we cross the axis?

1456
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:10,500
There's a jump.

1457
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:11,780
There's a jump.

1458
01:10:15,940 --> 01:10:17,220
How big is that jump?

1459
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:35,460
So we're going to do a little bit more with that next time.

1460
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:41,180
I'm sorry, I glossed over a few too many details in the derivation of the convergence theory

1461
01:10:41,180 --> 01:10:43,000
for the second time equation.

1462
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,060
So I'm going to stop a little earlier.

1463
01:10:46,060 --> 01:10:47,880
But I don't want to go any further than this.

1464
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:49,220
But I want to ask this question.

1465
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:54,260
If I calculate this derivative, it has to have this change.

1466
01:10:54,260 --> 01:10:56,100
It has to have this jump in it.

1467
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:57,100
How big is that jump?

1468
01:10:57,100 --> 01:10:59,680
What's it going to be proportional to?

1469
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:00,180
Yeah?

1470
01:11:00,180 --> 01:11:02,300
The charge, the search charge.

1471
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:04,580
Yeah, it's going to be proportional to the density.

1472
01:11:04,580 --> 01:11:07,020
So what do you expect this thing to generate for you?

1473
01:11:11,060 --> 01:11:12,060
So we have this jump.

1474
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:15,040
So we're on the other side of the jump.

1475
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:17,400
The density is going to show up.

1476
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:23,800
So you're going to have some alpha times the density plus an integral of this derivative.

1477
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:24,260
Right?

1478
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:29,260
So you're going to have some alpha times the density plus an integral of this derivative.

1479
01:11:29,260 --> 01:11:33,260
So you're going to have some alpha times the density plus an integral of this derivative.

1480
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:36,260
What kind of equation is this?

1481
01:11:36,260 --> 01:11:39,140
First or second con?

1482
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:41,080
It's second con.

1483
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:41,580
All right.

1484
01:11:41,580 --> 01:11:45,260
So I'm going to pick this up next time because I need to get this far.

1485
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:50,900
And now to have you hang on to it, I need to have some slides so you can see the picture

1486
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:51,740
in a little more detail.

1487
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:53,800
It's too hard to decipher it from my chalk writing.

1488
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:55,460
But I just want to give you the sense of this.

1489
01:11:55,460 --> 01:12:00,240
So what we're going to do next time is we're going to pick up from here.

1490
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:05,180
And we're going to look and see if we ever get second kind equations that we can use

1491
01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:06,180
this Neistrom for.

1492
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:11,180
And we're going to see that Norman problems generate second kind integral equations.

1493
01:12:11,180 --> 01:12:15,740
And those Norman problems generate second kind integral equations we can solve with

1494
01:12:15,740 --> 01:12:17,280
Neistrom methods.

1495
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:22,480
And then we'll end up looking at this issue of what happens when we generate those kinds

1496
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:23,480
of matrices.

1497
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:26,880
And we can figure out something to do with those things.

1498
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:27,880
So we're going to pick this up next time.

1499
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:32,880
But I want to give you this idea that we have this quadrature scheme.

1500
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:38,300
When we use this quadrature scheme in integral equations, we can come up with this Neistrom

1501
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:39,300
method.

1502
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:44,860
But the Neistrom method counts on a kernel that's smooth and a second kind integral equation.

1503
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:48,200
And the ones you naturally write down, the Dirichlet problems you naturally write down

1504
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:52,040
with Green's functions having to do with PDEs, are not second kind equations.

1505
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:53,040
And they don't have smooth kernels.

1506
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:58,120
But I'm going to show you that if you're solving Norman problems, you can do it with

1507
01:12:58,120 --> 01:13:01,120
the, you can generate a second kind equation.

1508
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:04,120
And in 2D, you get a smooth kernel.

1509
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:06,120
And to see that, we're going to need to move one more time.

1510
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,520
So let me stop there, and we'll pick it up next time.

1511
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:13,400
Let me remind you that we're going to do some evening class hours, Wednesday evening and

1512
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:14,400
Thursday evening.

1513
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:15,400
If these don't fit with your schedule, complain.

1514
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:16,400
Because we'll make the next one.

1515
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:17,400
Yep?

1516
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:18,400
Wasn't it Monday, today, Wednesday?

1517
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:19,400
Was it as a...

1518
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:20,400
So we kind of shifted the schedule.

1519
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:21,400
So we kind of shifted the schedule.

1520
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:22,400
So we kind of shifted the schedule.

1521
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:23,400
So we kind of shifted the schedule.

1522
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:24,400
So we kind of shifted the schedule.

1523
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,400
So we kind of shifted the schedule.

1524
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:26,400
So we kind of shifted the schedule.

1525
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:27,400
So we kind of shifted the schedule.

1526
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:28,400
We kind of shifted the schedule.

1527
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:29,400
And so we kind of shifted it around, I think.

1528
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:30,400
Which did you...

1529
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:31,400
Which did we end up with?

1530
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:32,400
So...

1531
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:33,400
It is Wednesday, and Tuesday.

1532
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:34,400
Yeah, I think...

1533
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:35,400
We talked about...

1534
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:37,220
So if it doesn't work for you, we'll do another session on Monday.

1535
01:13:37,220 --> 01:13:41,220
The problem is we can't really have something else to do other than the project that next

1536
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:42,220
week.

1537
01:13:42,220 --> 01:13:46,240
So there were rules about what we're allowed to do in the last week of classes.

1538
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:52,800
But if you can't make the Monday or Wednesday or Thursday of this week, we'll make a session

1539
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:53,400
of Monday.

1540
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:59,400
So anybody who has a conflict, if you can't make one of those days, that's on us.

1541
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:02,400
Just let us know and we'll make an extra session.

1542
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:07,400
And the idea is to try to make this so it's a good experience for you and so that you can try some things out.

1543
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:11,400
Not to add another thing to your queue of many end of term duties.

1544
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:18,400
But please, if Wednesday and Thursday turn out to be problematic to you, and problematic means you have a Friday problem set due,

1545
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:24,400
or anything in that range, any reason you want to push it off to the following week, we'll accept.

1546
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:29,400
So we're not, this is for your convenience, not to be an extra thing.

1547
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:31,400
Alright, we'll pick this up next time.

1548
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:37,400
So when there are evening classes, which days do we have evening classes?

1549
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:41,400
Which days in this week do we have evening classes?

1550
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:43,400
So we'll have them Wednesday and Thursday.

1551
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:46,400
It's Wednesday evening and Thursday evening this week.

1552
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:47,400
And we'll do a...

1553
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:48,400
Okay.

1554
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:50,400
A replacement session Monday evening of next week.

1555
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:53,400
And we'll put another one if that doesn't solve it for everybody.

1556
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:55,400
Okay, and it's here?

1557
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:56,400
Yeah, we'll do it here.

1558
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:58,400
And seven to nine?

1559
01:14:58,400 --> 01:14:59,400
Yeah, seven.

1560
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:00,400
Seven to nine.

1561
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:03,400
And we'll get it posted, we'll make it clear, we'll post it again on the web.

1562
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:07,400
I think we talked about a few different alternatives to do this.

1563
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:09,400
If you make sure it's up on the...

1564
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:11,400
Yeah, it is actually on here.

1565
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:12,400
It is, okay.

1566
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:13,400
Okay.

1567
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:17,400
And there is people who are requesting doing the final project in Council.

1568
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:18,400
So if you are interested, you can do that.

1569
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:20,400
If you are interested, can you just email me?

1570
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:25,400
I just need a count of how many students, so I know how many simultaneous sessions I

1571
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:28,400
need to get on the Council license.

1572
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:29,400
All right?

1573
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:30,400
Thanks.

1574
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:31,400
Is it a jury?

1575
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:32,400
I thought it was a jury.

1576
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:33,400
I thought it was a jury.

1577
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:34,400
I just...

1578
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:35,400
I just...

1579
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:36,400
I just...

1580
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:37,400
I just...

1581
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:38,400
I just...

1582
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:39,400
I just...

1583
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:40,400
I just...

1584
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:41,400
I just...

1585
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:42,400
I just...

1586
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:43,400
I just...

1587
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:44,400
I just...

1588
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:45,400
I just...

1589
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:46,400
I just...

1590
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:47,400
I just...

1591
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:48,400
I just...

1592
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:49,400
I just...

1593
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:50,400
I just...

1594
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:51,400
I just...

1595
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:52,400
I just...

1596
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:53,400
I just...

1597
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:54,400
nasıl...

1598
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:59,400
But, um, I think, our continuity concerns a lot.

1599
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:00,400
Uh, I just feel like...

1600
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:03,400
I don't know if likely because it's important and I wish it was the same, I just feel like

1601
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:04,400
you were interested in technology...

1602
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:05,400
Um, I was looking at the next question about, something like...

1603
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:06,400
Oh, sure.

1604
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:07,400
And also this one, you probably have all of our ....

1605
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:08,400
Oh, , and is this going to be?

1606
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:09,400
