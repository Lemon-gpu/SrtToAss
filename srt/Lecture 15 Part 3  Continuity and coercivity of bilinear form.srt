1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,460
We also need conditions for A. Okay, so first of all, A also has to be

2
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:26,520
continuous in a very similar way. So A, so continuity of A, u and v. So continuity

3
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:32,140
of a linear functional, let's go back to here, says that there has to be a constant,

4
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:38,020
finite constant, for which the value of the linear functional has to be less or equal to

5
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:48,220
the norm. So again, this is not in xv because L of v is to a field. So L of v has to be less than

6
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:56,080
the constant times the norm of that function. So continuity of this is very similar. So A of u and

7
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:56,480
v.

8
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:02,620
The norm of this, or absolute value, let's stick to the real number. So absolute value of this

9
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:11,480
is less or equal to c. So there exists a c such that this has to be less or equal to c

10
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:25,380
times the norm of u times the norm of v for all u and v. Okay, now because it's bilinear,

11
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,340
we need to

12
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:33,680
multiply. So the right-hand side, the bound is also bilinear. It's also bilinear in the sense that

13
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,960
it's not exactly bilinear. So the right-hand side is also a product of its ingredients. So if you

14
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:47,440
scale u by a number, by 2, the bound is also scaled by 2. If you scale v by 2, the bound is

15
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:55,760
also scaled by 2, right? Okay, so the continuity is easy. In order for finite element to be well

16
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,500
posed, we also need to multiply the number of elements. So if you scale u by 2, the number of

17
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,000
elements must be well-pumped and equal to the number of elements. So if you scale u by 2, the number of

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,380
elements must be well-pumped and equal to the number of elements. And we also need this

19
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:03,740
coercivity. That's a word I haven't seen anywhere else, but like this is what's called about a

20
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:20,600
bilinear functional. So coercivity is that there also exists a number b that is finite. So this

21
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:26,340
is only has to be finite, right? The b has to be greater, strictly greater than zero. And

22
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:26,460
that's the right-hand side. So we need this coercivity. So we need this coercivity. So we need this

23
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:32,600
and also finite, such that the other way is true.

24
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:42,600
So A of u and u, so that means if I plug in the same function on these two linear functionals,

25
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:50,240
on these two arguments of the bilinear form, this has to be greater or equal to this b

26
00:02:50,240 --> 00:03:00,080
times the norm of u squared.

27
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,380
So if A...

28
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:11,840
One way to think of a bilinear form is that A is like an infinite dimensional matrix.

29
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,240
So A operated on u and v is like u transpose times that infinite dimensional matrix times

30
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,240
v.

31
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,240
I mean, a matrix.

32
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,240
So I'm going to do this.

33
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:26,820
So a matrix is a bilinear function or a bilinear form in a finite dimensional space, finite

34
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,180
dimensional linear space.

35
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:36,260
You have a matrix A and you have v transpose times A times v, you get a number, right?

36
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:46,520
So this continuity is really for finite dimensional matrix, continuity is automatically satisfied.

37
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,240
For any finite dimensional space, you don't have the problem about continuity.

38
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,880
So but co-versivity in a finite dimensional sense is basically saying that the matrix

39
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,360
is positive definite.

40
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,440
Right?

41
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:07,480
You cannot have u transpose A times u being negative or being zero.

42
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:15,480
So the matrix has to be full rank and it's all the...

43
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,240
So u times A times u transpose A u has to be always positive.

44
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,240
All right.

45
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:29,200
So these are the two properties that needs to be satisfied for finite...

46
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,680
For the weak form to be well-posed.

47
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:41,480
And let's look at why under these conditions the weak form is well-posed.

48
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:46,440
So well-posedness of weak form.

49
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,440
All right.

50
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,440
So let's look at this.

51
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,440
So this is the weak form.

52
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:49,640
This is the well-posedness.

53
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,240
Okay.

54
00:04:51,240 --> 00:05:07,360
So well-posedness of the weak form is that if I have a u satisfying A of u, v equal to

55
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:18,000
L of v for all the v's, then I can bound this u.

56
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,440
I can bound this u because...

57
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:29,440
Because v times the norm of u squared, okay, is less or equal to A of u and u.

58
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,800
Right?

59
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,080
And this can be rewritten as this.

60
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:42,960
It can be rewritten as the norm of u is less or equal to 1 over this b times A u u divided

61
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,960
by the norm of u.

62
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,440
I'm just splitting the u norm squared into norm of u, norm of u here.

63
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,440
Okay.

64
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,440
So this is the normal view.

65
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,440
This is the normal view.

66
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,440
This is the normal view.

67
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,440
This is the normal view.

68
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,440
This is the normal view.

69
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:58,440
But this splitting is interesting because if I substitute this A u u with L of v, and

70
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,440
this is because...

71
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:06,200
This is because of u satisfying the weak form, right?

72
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:13,680
If u satisfies the weak form for any v, and that any v also include u itself, so what

73
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,800
I'm having is L of u divided by the norm of u.

74
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:25,000
And now what is this?

75
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,080
This is like the...

76
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,240
This is what appears in the definition of the norm of the linear functional.

77
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:39,240
This appears in the definition of this linear functional being bounded, or being continuous.

78
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,800
So this is less or equal to 1 over b times the norm of this L.

79
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,800
Right?

80
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,800
Okay.

81
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,800
So...

82
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,200
Now this is...

83
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:57,360
The result is saying that if we have a u that satisfies the weak form, then the norm of

84
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,200
the solution is less or equal to the norm of the right-hand side, the linear functional,

85
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:10,080
divided by the coercivity coefficient of the bilinear form.

86
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,080
Now it also guarantees...

87
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,000
This result also guarantees the solution is unique.

88
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Okay.

89
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So...

90
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
The solution is unique.

91
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Why is the solution unique?

92
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,400
The solution is unique because if I have u1 and u2 satisfying the same weak form, auv

93
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,400
equal to L of v for any v, so that is satisfied by u1 and u2.

94
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,400
So...

95
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,400
So...

96
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,400
So...

97
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,400
So...

98
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,400
So...

99
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,400
So...

100
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,400
So...

101
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,400
So...

102
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,400
So...

103
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,400
So...

104
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,400
So...

105
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,400
So...

106
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,400
So...

107
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,400
So...

108
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,400
So...

109
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,400
So...

110
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,400
So...

111
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,800
So...

112
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,800
So...

113
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,800
So...

114
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,800
So...

115
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,840
So...

116
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,840
So...

117
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,840
So...

118
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,840
So...

119
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,840
So...

120
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,840
So...

121
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,840
So...

122
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,840
So...

123
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,840
So...

124
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,840
So...

125
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,840
So...

126
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,840
So...

127
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,840
So...

128
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,840
So...

129
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,840
So...

130
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,840
So...

131
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,840
So...

132
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,840
So...

133
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,840
So...

134
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,840
So...

135
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,840
So...

136
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,840
So...

137
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,840
So...

138
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,840
So...

139
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,740
Of course, it's continuous.

140
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,600
And the norm of that 0 function is 0.

141
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,480
The norm of that 0 functional is 0.

142
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:31,080
So the norm of u1 minus u2 has to be less or equal to 1 over b times the norm of 0, which is 0.

143
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:40,140
That means the norm of u1 minus u2 has to be 0, which means u1 minus u2 has to be 0, which means u1 is equal to u2.

144
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,340
That means the solution is going to be unique.

145
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,980
All right.

146
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:54,040
It also tells me if I make a small error in the linear functional L, if I perturb the right-hand side by a small factor,

147
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:00,300
the perturbation in the solution can be bounded by the norm of that perturbation on the L.

148
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,120
So that's what I mean by, so the solution is unique and the solution is stable to perturbations.

149
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:13,900
Oh, the zero map is a linear functional, it's not a bilinear form.

150
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,380
Coercivity is a property.

151
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:24,320
So in order for you to define coercivity, you need a to be a function of two functions.

152
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,580
It has to be a bilinear form.

153
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:33,200
So the continuity can be defined on both bilinear form and linear functional.

154
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:41,900
So the zero functional on the right-hand side is a linear functional.

155
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,780
You can define continuity, but you can't define coercivity.

156
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:49,420
Coercivity is satisfied by this A, the bilinear form.

157
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:50,300
Yes?

158
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,660
What is definition of L?

159
00:09:53,780 --> 00:10:00,380
Definition of L is the linear functional in the weak form of the differential equation.

160
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,860
Oh, yeah.

161
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,020
It's the same as L of V, L of V.

162
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:14,320
It's just saying that we have defined the norm of this L.

163
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,440
L is a map.

164
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:21,220
L is a map from a function space to real numbers.

165
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:22,800
Right?

166
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:33,520
So here we define the norm of that map to be the maximum ratio between L of V and the norm of V.

167
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,200
For any possible V you can choose.

168
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,660
That is non-zero, of course.

169
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,020
Right.

170
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,320
Yes?

171
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:41,400
Yes.

172
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:46,360
Your question is, can I have a very large B?

173
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,360
Yes.

174
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,120
So that I can do very small.

175
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:49,920
Very small.

176
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:50,580
Yes.

177
00:10:52,580 --> 00:11:01,700
If I have a large V, if I have a large B, then even a very large perturbation on the right-hand side would give me a small perturbation on the solution.

178
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,940
If I have a small B, then the stability is less.

179
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,300
I have less stability, right?

180
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,280
A small perturbation may make me a large.

181
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,300
Change in the solution.

182
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,260
Yeah, that's right.

183
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,460
So B really determines how stable the solution is.

184
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,140
Oh, the step from here to here?

185
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,120
Okay.

186
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,760
This is because of U satisfying the weak form for any V.

187
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,540
So if I replace V with U, this is also satisfied.

188
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:35,820
Right?

189
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,840
So U is one of the possibilities of any V.

190
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,360
That means A.

191
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,280
A of U, U is equal to L of U.

192
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,860
So A of U, U is equal to L of U.

193
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,000
The others are kept the same.
