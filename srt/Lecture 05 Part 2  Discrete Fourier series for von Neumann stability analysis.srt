1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,960
We have the finite difference approximation, which is dui dt equal to kappa ui plus 1 plus ui minus 1 minus 2 times ui divided by delta x squared.

2
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:24,720
We can also apply the Fourier series on the discrete solution.

3
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:37,920
All right. So here, we remember that u of i is defined as the numerical solution at u times i delta x, right?

4
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:53,820
And if you represent using the same Fourier series, we get a summation over k of u hat of k e to the j k instead of x.

5
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,700
We have a summation over k of u hat of k e to the j k instead of x.

6
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:54,720
We have a summation over k of u hat of k e to the j k instead of x.

7
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,180
We have i delta x.

8
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:04,760
Now you know why we use j for the square root of minus 1, because we have i as the index.

9
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,080
All right.

10
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:18,180
So, but this summation, it actually doesn't make sense to sum over from minus infinity to infinity.

11
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,720
Because of the phenomenon called aliasing.

12
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,900
So what does aliasing mean?

13
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:49,000
Aliasing means that for a particular u k and a different u k that is of a different k, the effect of this term is going to be the same, exactly the same, represented on the discrete grid.

14
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,940
So let's imagine we have a discrete grid.

15
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,100
So let's imagine we have a discrete grid.

16
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:57,880
We have a discrete grid that is 0, delta x, etc., all the way to 2 pi.

17
00:01:58,780 --> 00:01:59,060
Okay.

18
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:11,500
The question, intuitively thinking, if I have one Fourier mode, that is exactly one period.

19
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:12,880
All right.

20
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,020
So that is k equal to what?

21
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,320
1 minus 1, right?

22
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,060
So e to the...

23
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,080
e to the...

24
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,420
jk...

25
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,280
Sorry, e to the ji delta x is a waveform like that.

26
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,460
All right.

27
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:42,260
Now, if I only look at the function value at the discrete points, I can actually draw a different wave that looks exactly the same on these discrete points.

28
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,900
How do I draw that?

29
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,780
Anybody have any idea?

30
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,900
How can I draw a different wave that...

31
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,200
has exactly the same value at these discrete points?

32
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:57,880
Straight lines.

33
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:58,600
Huh?

34
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,780
Straight lines.

35
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:00,940
Straight lines?

36
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,380
But remember, I have to be sinusoidal functions.

37
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,280
Sine of something or cosine of something.

38
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:07,080
Yes?

39
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,180
A 2 pi increase in the frequency?

40
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,940
Anything modulo 2 pi is...

41
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,780
That's a good thought.

42
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,940
But, like, 2 pi is not...

43
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,080
That's a lot of frequency.

44
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,080
2 pi is a period, right?

45
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,080
So you're thinking of increasing the frequency to something that makes it the same?

46
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,080
Anybody wants to come and draw something?

47
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,080
.

48
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,080
That's a very good idea.

49
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:44,080
So we no longer are thinking of functions that are long and smooth.

50
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,080
We're thinking of functions that are...

51
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,080
have a period that is almost equal to one grid point.

52
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,080
Right?

53
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,080
If we draw a function like that.

54
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,080
So we still have maximum being the same,

55
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,080
but we have a function that goes like this,

56
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,080
and back to minus 1,

57
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,080
and come back to here.

58
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,080
It has exactly the same function value.

59
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,080
And now it goes...

60
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,080
keeps on doing that.

61
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,080
It keeps on doing that.

62
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,080
The next time it'll come over.

63
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,080
So this way we have two functions

64
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:25,080
whose frequency is different by what?

65
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,080
Anybody take a guess?

66
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,080
So if this long one...

67
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,080
if this long wave number one has a...

68
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,080
if the long period one has a k equal to 1,

69
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,080
what is the k corresponding to the grid line?

70
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,080
So this is k equal to 1.

71
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,080
This is k equal to what?

72
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:53,080
That makes your 2 pi over delta x plus 1.

73
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,080
Right?

74
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,080
So if you...

75
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,080
if you think of this...

76
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,080
so e to the j...

77
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,080
2 pi over delta x plus 1

78
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,080
times i delta x.

79
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,080
I can expand it into a j of...

80
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,080
2 pi over delta x cancels with this.

81
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,080
So I get a 2 pi times i delta x cancels

82
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,080
plus j i delta x.

83
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,080
Right?

84
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,080
And the first term...

85
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,080
the first term...

86
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,080
and I can write this as...

87
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,080
the exponential of summation is equal to the product of exponentials.

88
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:37,080
And the first part is always equal to what?

89
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,080
1.

90
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,080
Right?

91
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,080
So that means...

92
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,080
when I shift the frequency...

93
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,080
and this happens for any k.

94
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,080
This actually happens...

95
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,080
for any k.

96
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,080
If I replace the 1 by k...

97
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,080
this is...

98
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,080
oh, so this is k i...

99
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,080
sorry, k i delta x.

100
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,080
This is going to be the...

101
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,080
exactly the same.

102
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:07,080
So if I shift the frequency by 2 pi over delta x

103
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,080
or 4 pi over delta x

104
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,080
or 6 pi over delta x,

105
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,080
I have exactly the same...

106
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,080
values at the grid points.

107
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,080
Therefore,

108
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,080
when I expand a discrete...

109
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,080
function...

110
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,080
in Fourier series,

111
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,080
it only makes sense to...

112
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,080
have a k...

113
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,080
go...

114
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,080
in between...

115
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,080
minus n over 2...

116
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,080
and n over 2 minus 1.

117
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,080
Where...

118
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,080
n is equal to...

119
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,080
the number of intervals...

120
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,080
basically 2 pi over delta x.

121
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,080
2 pi is the whole...

122
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,080
length of the interval.

123
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,080
Delta x is the length of each interval.

124
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,080
So n is the number of intervals...

125
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,080
over the domain.

126
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,080
If I, for example,

127
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,080
go all the way to 2 n...

128
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,080
instead of 2 n minus 1,

129
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,080
then I have a duplication.

130
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,080
Because k equal to minus n over 2...

131
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,080
is the same as positive n over 2.

132
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,080
Right?

133
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,080
They are exactly off by n.

134
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,080
Which is 2 pi over delta x.

135
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,080
And we already said...

136
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,080
if I shift...

137
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,080
k by 2 pi...

138
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,080
over delta x...

139
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,080
is the same function...

140
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,080
on the discrete points.

141
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,080
So this is what we call...

142
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,080
a discrete...

143
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,080
Fourier series.

144
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,080
Instead of a continuous Fourier series.

145
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,080
A continuous one goes from...

146
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,080
minus infinity to infinity.

147
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,080
A discrete one.

148
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,080
Because of this effect...

149
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,080
called aliasing...

150
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,080
we always have k go from...

151
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,080
minus n over 2...

152
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,080
to n over 2 minus 1.

153
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,080
Alright?

154
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,080
And...

155
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,080
why is it called aliasing?

156
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,080
There is a...

157
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,080
Anybody play video games?

158
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,080
Nobody?

159
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,080
Okay.

160
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,080
Some people.

161
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,080
So...

162
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,080
So when you...

163
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,080
when you draw a texture...

164
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,080
when you have a 3D video game...

165
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,080
and you draw a certain texture...

166
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,080
very, very far away from you...

167
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,080
the texture is going to contain frequencies...

168
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,080
that is...

169
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,080
that is going to be...

170
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,080
under resolved on the screen.

171
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,080
Like...

172
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,080
think of these grid points as pixels...

173
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,080
on your screen.

174
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,080
And...

175
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,080
think of this wave as...

176
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,080
the color...

177
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,080
or the variation of the color...

178
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,080
on your texture...

179
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,080
that you want to draw on the surface...

180
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,080
far, far away.

181
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,080
What you end up seeing...

182
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,080
is some pattern that has...

183
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,080
nothing to do...

184
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,080
with the texture you are drawing...

185
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,080
but looks like...

186
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,080
just a blob of weird things...

187
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,080
that emerges...

188
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,080
from the far away texture.

189
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,080
And that is called aliasing.

190
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,080
And anti-aliasing is...

191
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,080
one of the key technologies of...

192
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,080
video gaming.

193
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,080
So...

194
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,080
many different ways.

195
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,080
One way is you...

196
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,080
you basically do a...

197
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,080
some sort of smoothing to the texture...

198
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,080
before you draw it.

199
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,080
Another way is...

200
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,080
you actually over-sample...

201
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,080
which means...

202
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,080
I'm going to draw the texture...

203
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,080
at a resolution that is a lot higher...

204
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,080
than my screen resolution...

205
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,080
and then display it.

206
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,080
So there are ways to deal with it.

207
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,080
But this aliasing is the same...

208
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,080
as the aliasing we have in...

209
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,080
solving differential equations.
