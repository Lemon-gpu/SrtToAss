1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
One second.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,120
Actually record this one.

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,720
So for example, if you have a fluid flow problem, what you

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,520
care about is the velocity field and the pressure field.

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:15,120
And sometimes a typical mistake people make is they

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,800
say, what is the velocity input?

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,080
What's the flow rate output?

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:18,760
Things like that.

9
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,880
But they forget to give a pressure constraint.

10
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,640
So then basically it's not a unique solution system.

11
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,800
You could have the pressure adding any constant to the

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,160
entire system and it'll still be the solution.

13
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,640
So in that case, COMSOL either cannot give you a converged

14
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,940
solution or it'll give you an arbitrary solution.

15
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,620
And the better way, a more predictive way of getting a

16
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,520
right result is to add a pressure point constraint on

17
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,940
one of the points, like a gauge fixing.

18
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,200
And then same for the electric problem as well, actually.

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,260
If you do have the current, like input current of 1 amp

20
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,240
and output current, but you don't give a reference point,

21
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,000
then you have the same situation.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,780
So you do want to

23
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,780
have the constraint just one point.

24
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,500
So you can easily do so by right click and then add a

25
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,540
point condition and then add a ground somewhere in the system

26
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,120
or any kind of potential.

27
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,920
And sometimes you actually, for example, don't know what

28
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,620
is the reference point, but then you know kind of like a

29
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:16,580
floating potential.

30
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,400
So we do have other conditions.

31
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,580
I'm not too familiar with the ACDC part of it, but we do

32
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:25,060
have different terminal types, floating potential, and other

33
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,600
things you can use.

34
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,980
But you're very right.

35
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:31,700
So a lot of times in physical world, we think in the very

36
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,120
physics intuition kind of way.

37
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,920
But in the numerical world, then it's interpreted

38
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,860
differently, and you have to think from a mathematical

39
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,920
point of view and how the machine actually understands

40
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,940
those information.

41
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:46,200
Another important point, since you mentioned, is for

42
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,780
numerical solutions, so far can we trust the results?

43
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:54,720
Can we trust that 768, 568?

44
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,660
Maybe.

45
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,860
But I wouldn't trust it to the digits.

46
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,860
So I'm going to try to do that.

47
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:01,860
Because so far, we're using a relatively coarse mesh.

48
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,580
So in numerical studies, what you always want to do is you

49
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:08,480
can start with a coarse mesh so that you solve faster.

50
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:12,020
And then after you do that, refine the mesh a couple times,

51
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,260
actually, more than a couple times, and make sure that the

52
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,840
solution doesn't change according to the mesh density.

53
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,760
Then you know you actually eliminated the numerical

54
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,940
artifacts, and you're actually looking at a converged

55
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:21,720
solution.

56
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,340
Of course, the engineers have different tolerances of errors.

57
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,840
So you'll see the asymptotic limits as you refine the mesh.

58
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,360
And then you can determine, oh, just use less memory and be happy

59
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,640
with that 5% error.

60
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,420
So that is your call in terms of how fine, eventually, you want

61
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,780
to match the geometry.

62
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,740
There would be another approach, which is actually under the

63
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:46,520
solver setting, a more automatic way, which is to add adaptive

64
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,780
mesh refinement.

65
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,900
So basically, what it does is, depending on what error estimate

66
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,840
you gave, what tolerance you gave, it'll automatically insert

67
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,860
mesh points where necessary, say, where the gradient is high, where

68
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:56,860
the gradient is high.

69
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:57,860
You know, where the gradient is high.

70
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,740
So where you see a lot of things happening.

71
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:03,440
Then that is going to be more memory intensive.

72
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,500
But it's going to be more efficient in terms of

73
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,920
determining where to insert a mesh.

74
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,800
Because otherwise, you can do a local refinement in the manual

75
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,440
way, which will take you more time in terms of choosing which

76
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,980
region to refine and how fine to actually, how many

77
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,240
iterations to refine.

78
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,000
So yeah, something that comes in handy.

79
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,860
All right, so that's the second physics.

80
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,480
We'll go through the third physics really quick.

81
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,220
By, again, right click on component one, add physics.

82
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:36,780
And we are going to choose structural mechanics, solid

83
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,880
mechanics in phase, add it to the component.

84
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,820
So by now, you already know the drill, right?

85
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,040
You close the physics panel.

86
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,300
You have the solid mechanics here.

87
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,880
You have three default nodes, a default boundary condition.

88
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,760
Sorry, default boundary condition, free to move

89
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,620
everywhere, default governing equation of linear elastic

90
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,140
material.

91
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:57,480
If you want to change that, add non-linearity or pre-structural.

92
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,080
And if you want to change that, add non-linearity or pre-structural.

93
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,060
And you can also do it by using the thermal stress, or thermal

94
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:03,480
stress.

95
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,620
You do the right click on the material.

96
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,380
So in this case, we're going to just add a thermal expansion.

97
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,120
And say the temperature calculation for thermal

98
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,560
expansion comes from the heat transfer physics.

99
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,340
And then that's it.

100
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:20,040
So that's how we tied the second physics to the third one.

101
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,700
And then the free to deform everywhere, again, that's not

102
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,800
enough constraint.

103
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,800
Another example, actually, for constraint

104
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,040
is the number of degrees of freedom there are if it's a

105
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,300
rigid body.

106
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,620
More or less rigid.

107
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,560
Six, that's right.

108
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,160
Yeah.

109
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,800
So how do you have a unique solution?

110
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,400
You need six constraints.

111
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,740
So a typical way is people fix one point.

112
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,240
That eliminates three degrees of freedom.

113
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,560
Then the second point, you say you can only move in one

114
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,100
direction, so in case the structure actually expands.

115
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,300
But it will still stay on the same axis.

116
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,800
So that eliminates another two.

117
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,800
And then another rotational one.

118
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,300
And then the third point, you say you can only move in one

119
00:04:59,300 --> 00:04:59,800
direction.

120
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,800
So that eliminates the six degrees of freedom.

121
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,800
So that's how you eliminate the six degrees of freedom.

122
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,800
Or if you know that the shape on one end doesn't change,

123
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,800
you can actually glue the entire surface to another surface,

124
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,800
say a fixed surface.

125
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,800
So that will, of course, be sufficient for eliminating

126
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,800
the uncertainty here.

127
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,300
All right.

128
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:24,300
So in this case, we're going to just use the fixed constraint

129
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,180
on the two feet.

130
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,620
Actually, I could use the drop-down feet.

131
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,860
If you want to show that you can just, say,

132
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,440
use a please plate in particular, and then

133
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,320
each point may have two points, actually.

134
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,320
We've just given you theHệ IQ.

135
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,200
And so that's that much of dürfen excited about the

136
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:36,900
question after all.

137
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,560
And we think it's prettyigned.

138
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,060
Obviously, it's very easy to read the question form

139
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:40,440
here.

140
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,080
And it's so simple.

141
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,440
Instead of learning it's usuallyators that these

142
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,720
ones are adding, that's what we're seeing here in the

143
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,140
uni.

144
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,340
So what I mean to say is thisíd be theしま

145
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,860
needs all three off airplanelett.

146
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,220
So that means we have two dimensions.

147
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,600
It includes x, y, z components and a

148
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,560
way to contaminate every plane in each photosensitive

149
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:54,720
inals.

150
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,560
So that's how you compute it on your own.

151
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:55,620
I think it's for doing.

152
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,420
Bye-bye.

153
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:02,240
Well, so far it's actually a two-way coupling between physics number one and two, but a

154
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,600
one-way coupling between physics two and three.

155
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,960
So what I could have done is in the study step, I can use step one to solve for physics

156
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,120
one and two, and then step two to solve for physics three, use the information from step

157
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,120
one.

158
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,280
But in this case, the memory requirement is very minimal.

159
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,940
So how am I going to do the visualization for the third physics?

160
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:27,100
I could right-click on the surface plot of the temperature, add a deformation plot, use

161
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,880
the deformation to show the XYZ component deformation.

162
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,720
So you see what's the straight line, the initial shape, and the shady part.

163
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,180
After deformation, it's actually exaggerated by 53 times.

164
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:41,240
I can change that to one.

165
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,920
So you have a very small gap between the initial shape and the after deformation shape.

166
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,960
Of course, you can exaggerate it.

167
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,580
Any questions for the third physics?

168
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:51,920
Adding the third physics?

169
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:55,620
So more stress and analyze the structural deformation?

170
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,000
One second.

171
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,120
So coming back to the slice.

172
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,920
So so far, I hope I showed you the workflow where to find the different buttons.

173
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:14,140
I mostly used the model builder because the ribbon was actually introduced later, so I'm

174
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,700
more used to the older version of it.

175
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:21,580
But hopefully so far I showed you how to solve a coupled phenomena, how to introduce the

176
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,340
coupling.

177
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:26,800
And by now you understand there's no limitation how many physics you can choose and what kind

178
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,800
of coupling you can implement.

179
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:33,400
Even for a single physics, it's a very useful or simple tool to have because you have the

180
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:38,500
same workflow for all the physics that you also show in the UFO score.

181
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,340
And then I mentioned that anywhere you can type in constants, you can type in all the

182
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:46,080
other different things, numbing expressions, function calls.

183
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,080
You can add user-defined equations.

184
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,080
I haven't showed that yet.

185
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,080
Oh, and parameterization.

186
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,080
I want to quickly show that.

187
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,080
It'll be in the next slide.

188
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:51,580
Okay.

189
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,580
It'll only take a minute or so.

190
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:57,860
So a lot of times people want to compare different designs.

191
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,580
Actually let me disable this multi-physics node.

192
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:08,200
It was introduced with the second set of equations I introduced.

193
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,100
So my expansion, I'll disable that as well.

194
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,100
Okay.

195
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:16,380
So this was the working version of my last computation, the model.

196
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:21,080
So what happens if I want to try a few different designs and see which one gives me the peak

197
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,080
temperature, the highest peak temperature on one of the shoulder points?

198
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:31,080
So what I'll do is in geometry, I want to use a parameter to control that distance,

199
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,760
extrusion distance, so the thickness of it.

200
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,200
So just call it thickness.

201
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,720
Of course it's going to turn red because it's not defined anywhere.

202
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,580
In global definitions, I can add parameter list.

203
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:48,080
And here I'll say thickness 0.2.

204
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,080
And then I can go to the study.

205
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,080
Okay.

206
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,200
So in the study node, add a parametric sweep.

207
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,600
So now here pops the entire list.

208
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,420
Right now I only have one parameter.

209
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:03,720
And I'll say instead of 0.2, run me three cases, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4.

210
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:10,200
Or you can use the range button right here, typing the beginning and end, what's the step.

211
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,640
And now you've computed, it's essentially going to run the same problem three times

212
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,140
with a different geometry.

213
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:20,080
And every step is going to build a new geometry, build a new mesh, assemble a new system matrix,

214
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,420
and then give me a solution.

215
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:26,700
And it's going to put all the three solutions in one solution data set, as three separate

216
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,700
frames.

217
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,600
So if I want to run an animation that loops through that three frames, I could actually

218
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,180
do that.

219
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:38,440
Of course in time-dependent problems, you save the solution every certain seconds, and

220
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,400
then you can run the animation of that as well.

221
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,580
All right.

222
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,320
So now you've finished computing.

223
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,200
So now you see, for example, if I look at the temperature plot.

224
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,200
So you can see that the temperature plot is now running.

225
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,200
So now you can see that the temperature plot is running.

226
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,080
Okay.

227
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:57,500
So I could choose a different parameter and here the plot is going to update the visualization.

228
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,220
And I said I want to look at the temperature information at the shoulder point.

229
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:04,640
So let me first find out what's the coordinate of that shoulder point.

230
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,540
I'm going to add a measure under geometry.

231
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:14,800
I'm going to measure a point, 0.250.2.

232
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,700
And then what I'll do is in the solution data set, so the solution we have saved so far,

233
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:29,820
I'm going to right click, add a cut point 3D, type in 0.250.2, and choose that parametric

234
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,820
solution.

235
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:35,580
So I'm going to plot the information on that particular point.

236
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:41,500
I'll add a derived value of point evaluation, use this data set, evaluate the temperature

237
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,300
information.

238
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,540
So now it shows me what's the thickness and what's the temperature on that particular

239
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,540
point.

240
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,540
Okay.

241
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,600
So here I have a graph, shows me where the highest temperature is.

242
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,060
It shows up at the point four case.

243
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:58,480
Of course, it's only a small variance among the three cases.

244
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,480
So what should we do?

245
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,220
Run a batch refinement study, right?

246
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,220
Remember?

247
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:07,920
So after then you'll be confidently saying which one actually gives me the highest temperature

248
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,140
down.
