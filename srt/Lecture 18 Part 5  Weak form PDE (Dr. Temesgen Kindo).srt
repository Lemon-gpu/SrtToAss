1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,660
So then the other form is the general form PDE. This is also a template and the

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:18,760
template is this first equation. So it's shorter, it has fewer terms, but it's

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:26,340
more general. Basically what we specify here is E, D, and gamma,

4
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,620
applicate gamma, and the source term. And then the same templates, you have

5
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:38,280
templates for boundary conditions. So let's see how this will fit. If you

6
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:44,760
compare for example the general form template and the coefficient form

7
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:53,280
template, the coefficient form, if you have a source term, I mean an absorption

8
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,320
term like Au, for example, there isn't really a way

9
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,920
to put that term in the journal form, but what can you

10
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,720
do? You can always move it to the source term. The source

11
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,460
term can take anything.

12
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,780
You can write anything that didn't fit in the template,

13
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:12,180
you can fit it into the source term.

14
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,920
But either of these two templates, you can use them.

15
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,260
But then in the WIT form, what you get is nothing.

16
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:26,960
You get blank, and you have to directly specify your WIT form.

17
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,000
So here, you're getting more, basically you're removing the

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,060
training wheels in terms of how much control you have, but then

19
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,300
of course when you are working with the WIT form, you need to

20
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:43,920
be familiar, you need to be comfortable with first taking

21
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,700
the strong form, deriving it into a WIT form, but you get

22
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,100
extreme flexibility.

23
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,220
Since there is no template, you can do whatever you want.

24
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:52,260
.

25
00:01:52,260 --> 00:02:01,800
I should probably skip this slide.

26
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,220
You have seen this, right?

27
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,000
You start with strong form.

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,200
If the strong form was zero, you can multiply it by any

29
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,100
weighting function, and it should be zero everywhere.

30
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,660
If you integrated it, it should be zero for any weighting

31
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,560
function.

32
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,860
Of course, you pick the space of the weighting and the

33
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,220
solution, but skipping that.

34
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:31,760
So you can use integration by parts, Gauss divergence theorem

35
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,360
to move this to the boundary, and that's what you will have

36
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,460
for the WIT form.

37
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:42,460
The only thing is now how do I specify the W's when you are

38
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:46,020
specifying, now when you are typing, so far we were typing

39
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:50,860
quantities in terms of the dependent variables.

40
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,180
So saying U.

41
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:55,620
If you are solving for U or T, if you are solving for T.

42
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,920
But now here, we have a second variable, and the way you specify

43
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,480
in console is if you call the variable U, then when you want

44
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,220
to access the weighting function associated with that equation,

45
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,280
you're going to say test of U.

46
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,580
So or if your independent variable was M, then for W, you

47
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:22,140
will write test M. So the test operator basically

48
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:27,180
says I am taking the weighting function associated with this

49
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,180
primary variable.

50
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:33,600
There is a blog article if you are interested in this that

51
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:38,800
explains in detail how to implement WIT forms.

52
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,180
But you basically have a choice between WIT form, strong form,

53
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:47,900
and for the strong form, you can have the coefficient form, the

54
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,880
general form, and other forms as well.

55
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,100
Like for example, you can do the classical

56
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:56,300
PDA interfaces for things like Laplace equation, which are

57
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,180
commonly encountered.
