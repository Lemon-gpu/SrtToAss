1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:06,000
So remember, the starting point of a scalar conservation law, discretizing a scalar conservation

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,680
law is the what form?

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,200
Is the integral form because this is the only form that makes sense.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,680
The only form that doesn't involve d dx of any discontinuous functions.

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,680
Right?

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,520
I mean, if you remember when we do finite difference, we are using Taylor series to

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,780
analyze the accuracy of our discretization.

8
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:36,180
And in the Taylor series, we, no matter how high order the scheme is, we have a remaining

9
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:45,560
term that is proportional to delta x to the whatever power times the certain derivative

10
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,800
of this function.

11
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,800
Right?

12
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:56,460
For example, a second order scheme, the error term would be proportional to delta x squared

13
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,760
times maybe the third order derivative.

14
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,200
So, the third order derivative of the function may be the fourth order derivative of the

15
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,760
function, depending on what is the differential operator.

16
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:12,420
But the thing is, when you have a discontinuous solution, the third order derivative is what?

17
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,420
Is infinite.

18
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,420
Okay?

19
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,420
Is infinite.

20
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,920
The fourth order derivative is infinite.

21
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:25,340
So the order of accuracy doesn't, Taylor series order of accuracy doesn't make any sense anymore.

22
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:29,760
So no matter what you do, you get potentially infinite amount of error.

23
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,740
And use the integral form.

24
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:43,640
Use the integral form to avoid the potential problems with finite difference.

25
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:52,000
F of u at b minus f of u at a equal to zero.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,800
Okay?

27
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,500
And let us divide the whole equation by b minus f of u at a.

28
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,500
Okay?

29
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,500
So, we have the integral form.

30
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,500
So we have b minus a.

31
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:09,620
So, if you divide this, the integral of the solution over a small range by b over a, we

32
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,560
get the average.

33
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,220
The average value of u inside b and a.

34
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:28,480
So d dt of u bar, okay, over b and a plus f over the left, on the right side of the

35
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,480
domain.

36
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,500
Okay?

37
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,500
So e to the right minus f left equal to zero.

38
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,500
Okay?

39
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,500
A plus f over the right minus f left equal to zero.

40
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,280
Apply, oh sorry, over b minus a.

41
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:43,040
So apply this in a domain discretized in small intervals.

42
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,000
Delta x, two delta x, three delta x.

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,880
And this is N delta x.

44
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:55,260
How many, how many of these averages do we have?

45
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,260
So be very careful.

46
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,260
We just go wrong.

47
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,260
We need some more.

48
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,260
No, we don't want any more.

49
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:03,820
about the distinction between finite volume and finite difference. In finite

50
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:08,620
difference, depending on boundary conditions, we may have n-1

51
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:13,840
unknowns, we may have n-plus-1 unknowns, we may have n unknowns if the two sides

52
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,700
have different boundary conditions. For finite volume, we always have n

53
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:28,000
unknowns, the number of intervals. So let me write this as u-bar-1, so

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:36,100
the first self-average u-bar-2, etc., u-bar this would be n, what I have is

55
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:52,120
d u-bar-i dt plus b-minus-a would be delta x, right. And this is the flux at the

56
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:57,220
right side of the interval, i, which I call i-plus-half because it's

57
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:57,980
writing

58
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:07,580
between the interval i and i plus 1. Now we use integers to denote the cells, and

59
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:17,980
the grid points now become like second-class citizens. So we use the half-fractional

60
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:23,900
numbers to denote them. Like in finite difference, the grid points are first-class citizens. We use

61
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:29,820
integers to denote them. In finite volume, that's not the case. We reserve the integers to denote

62
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:36,780
the cells and the boundaries. They are less important. We use fractional indices.

63
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:45,340
Minus f of i minus half equal to zero. All right, so this is our finite volume scheme,

64
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:53,820
and this is exact. So there is no approximation yet in this derivation.

65
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,580
Now let's start our approximation.

66
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:12,700
The approximation needs to be there because the f is evaluated at the grid points.

67
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:23,660
So this f i plus 1, for example, is equal to f of u at x i plus half, right? x i plus half is

68
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:33,820
the grid points. And we don't have them in finite volume. We only remember the cell averages.

69
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:41,980
So we have to do some kind of interpolation. So this is what we have to interpolate.

70
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:49,580
So there are two types of interpolations. One type is to interpolate the u, the solution,

71
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:53,500
and apply the flux on top of the interpolated solution.

72
00:05:53,900 --> 00:06:03,260
The other way is to compute the flux directly on the cell averages and then interpolate the flux.

73
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:07,580
So either way is a perfectly fine finite volume approximation.

74
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:15,920
For example, I'm just going to give a very elementary example that is we call the central flux scheme.
