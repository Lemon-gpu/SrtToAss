1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,540
So phi of r should be exactly equal to 0 whenever r is less than 0.

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:10,200
Okay, let's then figure out if the positive part of this proposal works.

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,240
We only considered a case where r is equal to 1,

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,020
and we know that phi is equal to 1 is the appropriate value.

5
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,040
So let's consider two cases when phi is less than 1,

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:30,440
when r is less than 1, greater than 0, and when r is greater than 1.

7
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:35,880
So let's first consider this case when r is between 0 and 1.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,640
So just to draw this case, r is less than 1 means let's look at the definition.

9
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,380
It means the difference between ui and ui minus 1,

10
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:55,020
the difference between ui plus 1 and ui is less than the difference between ui and ui minus 1.

11
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:59,400
So the slope is higher on the left than on the right.

12
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:05,260
So ui, ui minus 1, and ui plus 1.

13
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:09,280
So this is the case when I have r between 0 and 1.

14
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:16,840
Okay, so the question is when I want to reconstruct the solution at i plus half

15
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,940
using ui minus 1 and ui,

16
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,840
how should I guarantee that the solution would never overwrite?

17
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,040
Well, I should.

18
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,040
To the existing maximum or minimum.

19
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:36,540
The proposal we had before, the blue proposal, is whenever r is greater than 0,

20
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:42,040
which is the case, we are performing a linear reconstruction up to here.

21
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,040
Would that guarantee a non-increasing local maxima?

22
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:53,040
No, because the ui plus 1 could possibly be a local maxima.

23
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,680
Right?

24
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:02,040
So in this particular case, phi equal to 1 actually does not guarantee monotonicity.

25
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,040
In this case, phi has to be less than what?

26
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,040
r?

27
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,040
Well, it's not easy to figure out.

28
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,040
Actually, let me write the condition here.

29
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,040
So the reconstructed value u at i plus half,

30
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,040
I think I used the red here, ui plus half left,

31
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:36,040
is equal to ui plus ui minus ui minus 1 divided by delta x times delta x over 2 times phi.

32
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,040
Right?

33
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,040
Okay.

34
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:47,040
And this has to be less or equal to ui plus 1 for monotonicity reasons.

35
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:53,040
Now, if I look at this inequality and move that ui to the right-hand side,

36
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:59,040
what we get is ui minus ui minus 1.

37
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:07,040
These two delta x's cancel, we get over 2 times phi is less or equal to ui plus 1 minus ui.

38
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,040
Right?

39
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:17,040
And we divide this on both sides to get the inequality for phi.

40
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,040
We get phi is less or equal to 2 times ui plus 1 minus ui

41
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:28,040
divided by ui minus ui minus 1, which is exactly 2r.

42
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:36,040
So phi has to be less than 2r in this range.

43
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:44,040
If I draw it, if this is half, 2r at r equal to half is equal to 1.

44
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:51,040
And this is the upper limit for what phi could be within this range.

45
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,040
Alright?

46
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,040
Does it make sense?

47
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,040
Okay.

48
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,040
So this part doesn't work.

49
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,040
This part could still work, right, in your proposal.

50
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,040
Alright.

51
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:10,040
So this part of the domain I can't be.

52
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,040
So this is what this says.

53
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:20,040
So I already know less than 0, I have to be exactly 0,

54
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,040
and I have a slope of phi equal to 2r.

55
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,040
It has to stay underneath.

56
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,040
And at r equal to 1, I know I have to be phi equal to 1.

57
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:37,040
So the other case is when r greater than 1.

58
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:48,040
So for r greater than 1, we have conditions we want to satisfy is the so-called symmetry of the flux reconstruction scheme.

59
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,040
Okay.

60
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:58,040
So when we try to compute, so phi of r,

61
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:08,040
so when we multiply phi of r times ui minus ui minus 1,

62
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:18,040
we want it to be the same as phi of 1 over r multiplied by u plus 1 minus ui.

63
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,040
So that gives us a symmetric scheme.

64
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:29,040
That is, when we flip this x-axis,

65
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:36,040
so this is symmetry,

66
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:45,040
because if we consider the x-axis to go that way,

67
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,040
and if we look at a scheme that is,

68
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,040
if we look at a discretization that has i-th grid point here,

69
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,040
i plus 1 grid point here,

70
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,040
and i minus 1 grid point here,

71
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,040
so this going backwards,

72
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:00,040
we are still going to have exactly the same type of reconstruction.

73
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:09,040
Here r, remember r is defined as ui plus 1 minus ui over ui minus ui minus 1.

74
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,040
So if we flip the axis,

75
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:16,040
if we flip the i plus 1 and i minus 1, r becomes 1 over r.

76
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,040
And,

77
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:22,040
ui minus ui minus 1 becomes ui plus 1 minus ui.

78
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,040
So we should have flipped over,

79
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,040
we should have,

80
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,040
the symmetry means if we flip this over,

81
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,040
the solution we get should be equal.

82
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,040
I think there may be a minus sign somewhere.

83
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,040
But like,

84
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,040
what this tells us is that,

85
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,040
what this tells us is that,

86
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,040
ui,

87
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,040
okay,

88
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:51,040
what this tells us is that if you divide both sides by ui minus ui minus 1,

89
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,040
what we get is,

90
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,040
phi of r,

91
00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:00,040
would be equal to r times phi of 1 over r.

92
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,040
Right.

93
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,040
And,

94
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:08,040
if we have in the range of r goes from 0 to 1,

95
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,040
phi is less than 2r,

96
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:14,040
that translates into the case when,

97
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,040
the argument of phi is greater than 1.

98
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,040
Because if you take r in between 0 and 1,

99
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,040
1 over r is greater than 1.

100
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,040
And if phi has to be less than 2r,

101
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,040
when r is,

102
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,040
being between 0 and 1,

103
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,040
so if this is less than or equal to 2r,

104
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,040
it means,

105
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,040
when,

106
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,040
it means when 1 over r is greater than 1,

107
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,040
phi should be less than,

108
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,040
what?

109
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,040
should be less than or equal to 2, right?

110
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,040
If you,

111
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,040
so there is r here,

112
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,040
there is r here,

113
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,040
if you divide on both sides,

114
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,040
it means phi of 1 over r has to be less than or equal to 2.

115
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,040
So,

116
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,040
there is another line that caps the value of phi,

117
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,040
when r is greater than 1.

118
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,040
So this is the region,

119
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,040
where,

120
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:09,040
we are going to get monotonic schemes.

121
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,040
So,

122
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,040
we are going to get monotonic schemes.

123
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,040
Alright?

124
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,040
Alright?

125
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,040
But,

126
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,040
here is the question.

127
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,040
If I keep phi equal to 0,

128
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,040
all the way,

129
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,040
is that good?

130
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:26,040
It satisfies both phi of r less than 2r and phi less than 2.

131
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:31,040
What requirement does phi always equal to 0 not satisfy?

132
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:37,040
It also satisfies the criterion that phi is equal to 0 when r is less than 0.

133
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,040
Yes,

134
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,040
I think that's a good question.

135
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,040
So,

136
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,040
I think that's a good question.

137
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,040
Yeah,

138
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:48,040
it doesn't satisfy that phi has to equal to 1 when r is equal to 1.

139
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,040
And that is for second order accuracy.

140
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,040
Right?

141
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,040
So,

142
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:59,040
choosing a phi always equal to 0 is actually going to get us a monotonic scheme.

143
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,040
But,

144
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,040
it doesn't have second order accuracy.

145
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,040
It's first order accurate.

146
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,040
And it turns out,

147
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,040
if we analyze the criterion for second order accuracy,

148
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,040
we get two more regions that we cannot be in.

149
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,040
These two more regions are,

150
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,040
if you draw a straight line,

151
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,040
so this is phi equal to 2r,

152
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,040
this is phi equal to r.

153
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,040
If you also draw a line that is phi equal to 1,

154
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:29,040
the two additional forbidden regions is here.

155
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,040
So we cannot,

156
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,040
if phi goes into here,

157
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,040
we don't have second order accuracy.

158
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,040
We also don't allow phi to be in here.

159
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,040
So if phi is here,

160
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,040
we don't have second order accuracy.

161
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,040
So if phi is here,

162
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,040
we don't get second order accuracy.

163
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,040
So the only region we can get both a monotonic scheme

164
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,040
and a second order accuracy is within this region.

165
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,040
Is,

166
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,040
is for phi greater than 1,

167
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,040
phi has to be,

168
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,040
oh, is for r greater than 1,

169
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,040
phi has to be greater than 1

170
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,040
and less than the minimum of r,

171
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,040
and 2.

172
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,040
So for phi less than 1,

173
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,040
for r less than 1 greater than 0,

174
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,040
phi has to be greater than r

175
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:27,040
and less than the minimum of 2r and 1.

176
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,040
So these are the two criterions

177
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,040
we have to satisfy for a second order

178
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,040
and a monotonic scheme.

179
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,040
So now we can start

180
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,040
discussing several possible choices.

181
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,040
Do you have a question?

182
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,040
Question here?

183
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,040
Okay.

184
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,040
So the first choice is the most,

185
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,040
is the one that gets us to second order accuracy

186
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,040
while being as close

187
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,040
to the piecewise constant reconstruction as possible.

188
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,040
What is that?

189
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,040
Remember, phi equal to 0

190
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,040
means piecewise constant reconstruction.

191
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,040
Right?

192
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,040
Not using the slope at all.

193
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,040
So how do we get second order accuracy

194
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,040
being the green region

195
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,040
while be as close to phi equal to 0 as possible?

196
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:22,040
No question we have to trace through this 0 line.

197
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,040
In this region, I can't be state 0,

198
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:29,040
but I can stay at r, phi equal to r.

199
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,040
While in this region,

200
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:35,040
I can stay at phi equal to 1, always.

201
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,040
Right?

202
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,040
So the,

203
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,040
this is called the mean mod limiter.

204
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,040
So mean mod

205
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,040
of r

206
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,040
has three pieces.

207
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,040
It can be 0, it can be r, it can be 1.

208
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,040
It's 0 when r is less than 0.

209
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,040
And it's r when

210
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:02,040
r is less or equal to 1, greater or equal to 0.

211
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:06,040
And it's 1 if r is greater or equal to 1.

212
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,040
So that's the first type of limiter

213
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,040
that is going to give us

214
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,040
second order accuracy and monotonic.

215
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,040
There are also other limiters.

216
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,040
For example, the other extreme

217
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,040
is to stay as high as possible.

218
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,040
Right?

219
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,040
It's the other scheme using the green one

220
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,040
goes like this.

221
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,040
It stays 0.

222
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:36,040
Still, any working limiter has to stay 0

223
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,040
for r less than 0.

224
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,040
Then it traces the upper limit

225
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:46,040
of the allowable region.

226
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,040
So instead of three pieces,

227
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,040
it has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 pieces.

228
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:58,040
So this limiter is called a super b.

229
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,040
It has five cases.

230
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,040
It is either 0,

231
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,040
in this range is 2r,

232
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,040
in this range is 1,

233
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,040
in this range is r, and 2.

234
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:12,040
So it can be 0 or 2r,

235
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,040
or 1 or r or 2,

236
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,040
depending on if r is greater than 0,

237
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,040
or r is in between 0 and half,

238
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:25,040
or when r is between half and 1,

239
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,040
and if r is between 1 and 2,

240
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,040
and r greater than 2.

241
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,040
All right.

242
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,040
So this is tracing the upper limit

243
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,040
of the contour of this allowable region.

244
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,040
And you can see that both type,

245
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,040
both mean limiter and super b limiter,

246
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:52,040
so this is super b,

247
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,040
they are piecewise continuous.

248
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,040
They have many discontinuous pieces.

249
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,040
And that is,

250
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,040
sometimes is not the most desirable behavior

251
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,040
for differential equation solvers.

252
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:12,040
When people want as little non-smoothness

253
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,040
as possible in their discrete solver,

254
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,040
they usually choose something in between

255
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,040
that align, that go smoothly

256
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,040
over all these regions

257
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,040
and stay in the allowable region always.

258
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,040
This type of,

259
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,040
the first type of this limiter

260
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,040
is constructed by Van Leer.

261
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,040
And, you know,

262
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,040
it's also,

263
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:40,040
so this limiter is called the Van Leer limiter.

264
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,040
It is only,

265
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,040
it only has two pieces.

266
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:48,040
Again, it is 0 when r is less or equal to 0.

267
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,040
But when r is greater than or equal to 0,

268
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,040
it has the same function,

269
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,960
2r divided by 1 plus r.
