1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
So today we will be talking about equation based modeling using console physics.

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:13,200
On Monday what you will see was a general introduction and using the built-in

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,880
physics based interfaces to solve different physical problems but

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:23,400
sometimes the models you want to solve might not be already built in into the

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,900
software but you might have your ordinary differential equation or partial

6
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,940
differential equation that models that process and so what we're talking about

7
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:40,320
today is how to enter those equations and how to pick the appropriate

8
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:47,640
interface and how to couple different PDs together if you have a couple of PDs

9
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:55,320
system. My name is Tamis Sagan, you can call me Tami. I work in the console as an

10
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,000
application engineer.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,880
Primarily I work for Microsoft and I work for Microsoft and Microsoft is a

12
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,040
traditional software development company that is primarily focused on

13
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,660
structural mechanics and equation based modeling. So today we will be mostly

14
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:14,440
talking about equation based model. Now, console under the hood is really a

15
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:21,440
system for solving partial differential equations numerically. This can be linear

16
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:27,000
equations, nonlinear equations, scatters, systems but the idea is if we build the

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:35,720
if we build the infrastructure to solve an arbitrary system of PDEs or ODEs and algebraic

18
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:42,840
equations then we would be able to handle a lot of problems that are encountered in science and

19
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:50,360
engineering. Some other software sometimes start with solving a certain area saying okay we want

20
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:55,800
to solve a heat transfer problem or we want to make a fluid flow or we want to make structural

21
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:02,680
mechanics simulation package and the way we went about it is we want to make a PDE solver

22
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:09,240
and an ODE solver and anything most problems coming down form anyway then you can handle

23
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:16,840
them. So some of the more popular partial equations here the Maxwell equations at the bottom Navier-Stokes

24
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:23,800
equation at the top heat transfer, chemical interaction engineering, acoustic, Schrodinger's equation, the

25
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,240
elasticity equation.

26
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:25,740
So

27
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:36,680
the way this works then is under I mean on top of these PDEs we build physics based interfaces

28
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:44,840
for structural mechanics or electrical chemical thermal fluid and whenever you are designing any

29
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:50,920
device or analyzing most realistic problems there is going to be more than one of this

30
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,960
involved. If you are doing fluid structure interaction

31
00:02:53,960 --> 00:03:01,240
you would need to couple structural mechanics with fluid flow. This happens often for example

32
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:08,040
if you are doing biomechanics and you want to analyze flow in blood vessels and then also

33
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:13,480
analyze stress in the arteries and couple that then you would need to do fluid structure

34
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:19,960
interaction. Or if you have doing a chemical reaction problems where the reaction generates or

35
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,600
consumes heat,

36
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:31,320
and also where reaction kinetics is temperature dependent you want to couple equations for chemical

37
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:39,800
and reaction with thermal equations. So there can be more than one of this that are combined and a lot

38
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:47,960
of this commonly understood multiphysics couplings are already built in into a console and a lot of the

39
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,880
problems that you might be interested in solving are already built in. I hope much of this will be

40
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,920
understood by the next lecture. Thank you.

41
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:59,160
One day you did the micro-remister beam example. This is what me and did.

42
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,520
It transfer electrical and I think structural mechanics and the couplings you needed there

43
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:11,640
were already built in so you just needed to click and add them and console would add the

44
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:16,200
necessary equation. But when you are doing research, when you are doing development,

45
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:23,080
often the equations you are interested in solving may not be part of what is built in

46
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:23,640
or maybe part of the solution. So I think that's a good question.

47
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:28,760
Maybe part of it is built in but there is a missing part. Maybe you are doing a structural

48
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:35,240
mechanics problem where the material behavior has a certain evolution law and that material

49
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:40,280
evolution law is not built in but structural mechanics in general is built in. So then what

50
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:47,480
you can do is just add your evolution equation as a PDE and couple it with the existing physics-based

51
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:52,840
interface. That is how most of our users do work when they

52
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,920
use equation-based modeling. It's rare that people will do everything from scratch using

53
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:04,360
equation-based modeling but obviously you don't want to reinvent the wheel. Part of it is already

54
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:10,440
there and the part that's missing you can add using user-defined equations. So

55
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:17,880
user-defined equations you use them when what you're interested in solving is not

56
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,680
in there or sometimes you're actually just curious to work directly with the equations.

57
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:29,880
Other times maybe you are a professor and if you are a grad student then just give it to them and

58
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:37,560
they should make it for you. But in any case we'll be talking about how then to implement your own

59
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:49,560
equations in Comsol. So the way it works is there are multiple templates for entering the equations

60
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,160
for ODEs, for PDEs and there are more than one ways.

61
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:58,120
So the first way is to use the equation-based model. So you can use the equation-based model

62
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:04,520
to enter PDEs. We'll talk about them. But the biggest thing is that you don't need to write

63
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:12,600
subroutines or anything like that. You just write your PDEs directly and that makes it faster for

64
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:18,600
you to try out different ideas when you're going well maybe the equation behaves this way. Maybe

65
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,640
there is this term I want to keep or maybe there's this other term I don't want to give.

66
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:28,600
So whenever you do that if you can directly prescribe your equations it makes it easy.

67
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:34,840
And these equations can be nonlinear, linear, transient or stationary. You don't have to

68
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:42,280
worry about that. Of course since you are taking a take a numerical analysis class you won't worry

69
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:49,880
about that. But in a more when you're using software to solve physical problems to solve to

70
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,760
develop a device.

71
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:58,280
So the first thing that you want to do is quickly test your ideas. And then of course later on you

72
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:06,120
can tweak once you have made the major decisions about your physics. So the way we will go about it

73
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:13,080
today is we'll talk about the mathematics interface first. Then I will focus on partial differential

74
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:17,480
equations, how to prescribe partial differential equations and boundary conditions when you are

75
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,480
using equation-based modeling.

76
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:24,920
So this is a very simple process. We will start with the first one. So we will start with the

77
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:33,080
differential and algebraic equations. Then we will do a demonstration of a thermal curing problem.

78
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:39,800
This is a heat transfer problem with a slightly non-standard material evolution law. So the way we

79
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:46,200
would normally solve this console is use the built-in equation the built-in heat transfer

80
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,880
interface for the heat transfer part.

81
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:58,920
So we will start with the thermal curing and couple them. But today for the for medical reasons what we will do is we'll do all of it using equation-based modeling.

82
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:09,720
We'll talk a little bit about what happens when you're working with axisymmetric components.

83
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:17,800
We'll talk a little bit about integral equations. We'll talk about verification.

84
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:26,760
And validation when you are using any of the built-in physics-based interfaces such as heat transfer

85
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:35,640
or structural mechanics or microfluidics or pipe flow in console. And this is true about other

86
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:44,520
packages as well. They would have done a verification of the fact that they have implemented

87
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,160
the right equation and whether it fits.

88
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:54,760
If weather works correctly by comparing it with either analytical solutions or experimental data.

89
00:08:54,760 --> 00:09:00,760
Now you are putting your own equations and you don't have anything like that to rely on the

90
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:07,640
veracity of your equations. So we want to talk about how is it that then you can test

91
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:14,920
you are doing the right thing. You are solving the equation correctly.

92
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,640
And finally we'll go to the next slide.

93
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:23,320
So I will give you homework. Your professor wanted us to give you homework so we'll do that.

94
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:32,360
I will be asking you questions along the way and feel free to ask me any questions.

95
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:39,000
Don't wait until the end if anything in this whole conversation just stopped me and asked.

96
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:46,040
I have a couple of hats that I will give away either for good answers or really good questions.

97
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,800
And I'll let you decide.

98
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:53,960
Any questions so far?

99
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,000
Asking if you can get the hats isn't a good question.

100
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,720
Any other questions is legit.

101
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:01,660
Okay.

102
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,400
So let's start with how console deals with this.

103
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:12,360
When you, you have seen this Monday when you start a new problem.

104
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:17,800
You have to select the physics after you have specified your special dimension with everything.

105
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,400
3D, 2D, 1D, or 2D over 1D axis and metric.

106
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,960
You select the physics.

107
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:32,040
And here you see the ACDC, which are different interfaces for electrical and magnetics,

108
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:37,080
electromagnetic in general, or the fluid flow, heat transfer, semiconductor structural mechanics.

109
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,240
And at the end there is this node mathematics.

110
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:47,320
And that is where you go when you want to add your own equations rather than using the built-in

111
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,680
interfaces.

112
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:57,160
Now when you go to the mathematics interface, then there are choices within it.

113
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:05,000
So you could be specifying PDs, you could be specifying ODEs, you could be doing optimization

114
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,760
and sensitivity analysis.

115
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:11,160
We have this classical PDs branch.

116
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,800
That is really a replica of the PD interfaces.

117
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,760
But things like this.

118
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,800
And then you have the other interfaces.

119
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:22,040
Things like Laplace equation, Poisson equation, Helmholtz equation.

120
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,560
People often use them.

121
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:28,680
So we want sort of a prepackaged option for those.

122
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,240
So that's what you get under classical PDs.

123
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:38,520
If you are solving a problem with a moving domain or with a moving interface, we have

124
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:44,200
a mathematical level set and phase field interfaces that you can use.

125
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,720
So for example, if you're having a heat transfer problem with space change.

126
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,040
We already have a heat transfer with space change interface built in.

127
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:57,960
But this is when you are adding your own phase field or level set type mathematics.

128
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:06,760
Then the form branch for solving problems on moving domains and other interfaces.

129
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:12,760
So what we will be talking about today is what we get in the PD interfaces and in the

130
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,520
OE and DA interfaces.

131
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,160
And as you see there in the PD interfaces.

132
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:23,320
You have a couple of different options to specify your PDs.
