1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,260
So the reason we are defining the sub-left space is because it's the kind of sub-left space that we can define the weak form of the differential equations.

2
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:27,120
So for example, in our previous Poisson's equation, we derived the equivalent form of the Poisson's equation,

3
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:35,360
that is, integration of the product between the derivative of a test function and a solution,

4
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:42,100
plus the integration of the test function times the right-hand side, is equal to zero.

5
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,880
So that was an example.

6
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,220
And in order to say this is equivalent to the differential equation in some sense,

7
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,760
we need to restrict both u and v into a space.

8
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,820
And in our previous example, we directly went to a finite dimensional space.

9
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:06,620
But of course, going to a finite dimensional space makes an approximation.

10
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,120
It makes an approximation to the differential equation,

11
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,120
and through this...

12
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,260
this weak form.

13
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,260
But if we don't restrict the u and v to a finite dimensional space,

14
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:22,260
but restrict it to a sub-left space, which is infinite dimensional,

15
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:27,260
we can say that the solution recovers the solution of the differential equation exactly.

16
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,260
Okay.

17
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,260
So...

18
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:39,260
So the weak form of the equation is to...

19
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:52,260
the weak form of the Poisson's equation is the following.

20
00:01:53,260 --> 00:02:01,260
So find a solution u in H1 of A and B.

21
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,260
H1 is the sub-left space we defined earlier.

22
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,260
Such that...

23
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,260
for all v,

24
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,260
we call it test function,

25
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:14,260
we call it test function within the same space.

26
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,260
Okay.

27
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:24,260
This box is true.

28
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,260
Right?

29
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:32,260
Which is like the integral plus the integral equal to zero.

30
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,260
So this box is the same as this box.

31
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,260
So this is the weak form of the Poisson's equation.

32
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,260
And it's a weak form because...

33
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,260
if...

34
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:47,260
if f is regular enough,

35
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:51,260
so if f is a smooth function, let's say, or continuous function,

36
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,260
then we have a twice-differentiable u, right?

37
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:00,260
Because if f is a function,

38
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,260
actually any function,

39
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,260
then the second-order derivative of u has to be equal to that function,

40
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,260
which means, of course, that u is twice-differentiable.

41
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,260
If that is the case,

42
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,260
then the solution of the weak form

43
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:19,260
is equivalent to the solution of the strong form of the differential equation.

44
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,260
But it is weaker in the sense that...

45
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,260
if f is not a function,

46
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,260
so it holds,

47
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:33,260
even if f is not a function,

48
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:39,260
even if f is a distribution,

49
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,260
it is a function instead of a function.

50
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,260
And...

51
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:48,260
for example, what is an example of a distribution that is not a function?

52
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,260
Hm?

53
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,260
Sorry?

54
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:55,260
A Dirac, right, or a delta function, a Dirac delta function.

55
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,260
So for example,

56
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:03,260
let's say f of x is equal to a Dirac delta function x minus 0.5,

57
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:07,260
and our domain is in 0 and 1.

58
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,260
Okay?

59
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:11,260
We can see that it doesn't make sense to say

60
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:15,260
the second-order derivative of u plus a delta function is equal to 0,

61
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,260
but it does make a lot of sense to say

62
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,260
this integral is always equal to 0.

63
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:25,260
Because if f is a Dirac function,

64
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:29,260
then what is the integral of f times v?

65
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:34,260
It's just the value of v, right?

66
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,260
It's just the value of v at 0.5.

67
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:43,260
It's perfectly well-defined, right?

68
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,260
Okay, so in this case,

69
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,260
what we are going to get,

70
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,260
so let's figure out what we are going to get here.

71
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,260
So what we get is that

72
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:56,260
the integration of a and b of any v times,

73
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,260
not any v, partial v partial x,

74
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:01,260
partial u partial x dx,

75
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,260
has to be equal to v at 0.5.

76
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:12,260
Okay, so what does this tell us?

77
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,260
It tells us that the u,

78
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:23,260
so it tells us that u is not twice differentiable.

79
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,260
We are going to solve it later.

80
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,260
We haven't defined the boundary conditions yet.

81
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:31,260
But it tells me that u has to be a piecewise linear function

82
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:37,260
and this derivative has to be discontinuous at 0.5.

83
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,260
To see this,

84
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:46,260
let's define a boundary condition for this equation.

85
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,260
For example, let's define

86
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:54,260
with u equal to u equal to 0.

87
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:58,260
So let's define a most trivial boundary condition.

88
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,260
And what we need to do is,

89
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,260
this boundary condition is,

90
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,260
we are going to talk about later,

91
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:06,260
is an essential boundary condition that restricts

92
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,260
this,

93
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:11,260
that shrinks the space.

94
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:14,260
So we call it h1 0

95
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:20,260
because this is equal to all the f within h1,

96
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,260
a and b,

97
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:27,260
such that f0 is equal to f1 is equal to 0.

98
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:31,260
So all the functions that satisfy a certain boundary condition.

99
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:34,260
Right, so it's even a smaller space.

100
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,260
So then for all the v in the same space,

101
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:41,260
which is also have to be satisfying the boundary condition,

102
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,260
we have the,

103
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:48,260
we have the weak form to be true.

104
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:59,260
Okay, so now if we know both u and v satisfy the boundary condition.

105
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:05,260
Okay, and so here what we can see is that

106
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:11,260
one way for this to be always true is for u to be a linear function

107
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,260
in both.

108
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,260
So, so for this to be true,

109
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:27,260
u has to be linear in 0 and 0.5 and 0.5 and 1.

110
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:32,260
Because a linear function means the derivative is going to be a constant.

111
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,260
Right.

112
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:39,260
A constant times the derivative of v integrated between 0 and 0.5

113
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:43,260
is going to give me the value of v at 0.5.

114
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:51,260
And so let's do this.

115
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:59,260
So the integral of a and b of these is going to be equal to,

116
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,260
so let's say a is equal to 0, b is equal to 1.

117
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,260
Okay.

118
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:07,260
So b is equal to 1 is going to be equal to from 0 to 0.5

119
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:22,260
of du dx left times dv dx times dx plus du dx right.

120
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:26,260
So, so u is going to be split into two halves.

121
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:31,260
So u is going to be like that.

122
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,260
Okay.

123
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:36,260
And it has to satisfy the boundary conditions.

124
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:46,260
And you get partial v partial x dx 0.5 to 1.

125
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,260
So what we ended up getting is that,

126
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:57,260
so du dx,

127
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:01,260
so du dx at the left is basically 2.5.

128
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:07,260
So basically 2 times u, u at 0.5, right?

129
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:14,260
Because this is 0.5, this is 1, and this is u at 0.5.

130
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:21,260
If you divide by 0.5, you get the slope at the left times v at 0.5.

131
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:26,260
And the other quantity is the slope of u is negative.

132
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:29,260
So minus u times 0.5.

133
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:38,260
And the integral of v dv dx over the second half of the domain,

134
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:41,260
because v is also satisfied the boundary condition 0.

135
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:45,260
So it's going to be minus v at 0.5.

136
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:59,260
And with that summed together, we have 4 times u at 0.5 times v at 0.5.

137
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,260
Right?

138
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:07,260
So what we are doing is that we have constructed a u that is in H1.

139
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,260
Right?

140
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:13,260
u is in H1 because u is a hat function.

141
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,260
It's continuous.

142
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,260
The square is integrable.

143
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,260
The derivative of u is also integrable.

144
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,260
It's no longer continuous at 0.5.

145
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,260
It's piecewise constant.

146
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,260
But the square of that is still integrable.

147
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:29,260
So we constructed a u that is not twice differentiable,

148
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:32,260
but in H1.

149
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:39,260
That satisfies the weak form for a right-hand side being a delta function.

150
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,260
Right?

151
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:45,260
So to get the u, this is equal to v at 0.5.

152
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:52,260
That basically means u at 0.5, this has to be 1 fourth.

153
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,260
Right?

154
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:57,260
So with u equal to 1 fourth,

155
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,260
this is going to be equal to v at 0.5,

156
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,260
which is the right-hand side we want.

157
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:05,260
So we constructed a v that goes from 0 to 1 fourth

158
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,260
when x goes from 0 to 0.5 and then goes down to 0.

159
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:11,260
That satisfies the boundary condition.

160
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:17,260
It satisfies the weak form for f.

161
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,260
That is a distribution.

162
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,260
That is not a function.

163
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,260
So the weak form is weaker in that sense.

164
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,260
It's somewhat...

165
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:33,260
The sense of that is similar to how we change the strong form,

166
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:37,260
the differential form, to the integral form in finite volume.

167
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,260
Right?

168
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,260
In finite difference...

169
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:43,260
In finite element, we also transform the equation to a weak form

170
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,260
using integration by parts like that.

171
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:48,260
And the weak form is weaker in the sense that

172
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:52,260
the exact equation, differential form,

173
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,260
does not have to make any sense.

174
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,260
Make any sense, even.

175
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:59,260
For right-hand sides that are not even a function.
