1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,240
So linear action equation, we have partial u, partial t, plus a big U, partial small u, partial x equal to 0.

2
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:25,800
Fourier analysis of the continuous equation, I think we did it in the beginning, we no longer do it here.

3
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,920
And we directly do our Fourier analysis to the discretized equation.

4
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:38,820
Okay, so, and as we did our first project, we know a more accurate way of discretizing the central,

5
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:44,740
or the spatial derivative is through the central derivative, right?

6
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,080
So that's, what's the order of accuracy of that?

7
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:54,360
It's going to be second order instead of the first order if you do it in one side, right?

8
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:55,780
So this is equal to 0.

9
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:05,440
And now we expand the Ui, just the Ui in Fourier series and also discrete Fourier series.

10
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:16,280
Minus n over 2 and n over 2 plus 1, U hat k times e to the jk i delta x.

11
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,940
So, with this, the left-hand side becomes

12
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,780
summation of k, and then we have the left-hand side becomes summation of k,

13
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:32,020
dUi dt times e to the jk i delta x.

14
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:43,300
And this term becomes U still 2 delta x, still summation over k, still U hat of k,

15
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,920
but this becomes different.

16
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:53,300
jk i plus 1 delta x minus e to the jk i minus 1 delta x.

17
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,300
Right?

18
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,880
So now, this is equal to 0.

19
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,340
So, again, matching coefficients.

20
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:13,700
This needs to be added to this times this needs to be 0.

21
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:21,180
So, dUi dt plus big U times U hat of k.

22
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,780
Oh, let's also expand this to be er.

23
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:33,780
So, this is equal to E to the jk i delta x times e to the jk delta x minus e to the minus jk delta x.

24
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:34,140
Right?

25
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:40,340
So, this is basically extracting, expanding this i plus 1 and i minus 1

26
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:47,240
into exponential of summations, which is equal to the product of exponentials.

27
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,140
Right?

28
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:49,480
Okay.

29
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:55,780
So, now we have e to the jk delta x minus e to the.

30
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,720
minus jk delta x over 2 delta x equal to 0.

31
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:08,220
Again, we can write this as an ODE equal to minus, in this case,

32
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:20,480
U 2 delta x e to the jk delta x minus e to the minus jk delta x times Uk hat.

33
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,480
Now, this is no longer a real equation.

34
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,800
This is a real number.

35
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,800
This is a complex number.

36
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,300
All right?

37
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,380
This is a complex number now.

38
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,560
And this complex number, we can write it out.

39
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,200
The cosine and cosine actually cancels.

40
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:47,120
We get a 2j of sine of k delta x term divided by 2 delta x,

41
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:52,980
which is equal to j times sine k delta x divided by delta x.

42
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:53,300
Okay.

43
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:53,980
Okay.

44
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:54,980
Okay.

45
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:55,320
Okay.

46
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:55,580
Okay.

47
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:55,640
Okay.

48
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:55,780
Okay.

49
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:55,860
Okay.

50
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:55,920
Okay.

51
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:55,940
Okay.

52
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:55,960
Okay.

53
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,120
Okay.

54
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,180
Okay.

55
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:56,600
Okay.

56
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:56,800
Yes?

57
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,000
Why do we have an i x j u?

58
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,600
We already expanded u in Uk.

59
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,640
Oh, it's Uk.

60
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:05,920
Yeah.

61
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,280
Sorry.

62
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,480
We already expanded Uk.

63
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:08,840
Right.

64
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:09,340
Yeah.

65
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:09,740
Thank you.

66
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,260
Thank you for correcting me.

67
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,400
Yes.

68
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,020
Yeah.

69
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,780
We already expanded.

70
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:15,920
Okay.

71
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:20,760
So, this is equal to that.

72
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,300
And we need to multiply a minus u onto that.

73
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,800
That is the lambda we'll be using.

74
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,800
Okay.

75
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,760
So, can somebody look at this lambda and tell me, can I use forward order on this?

76
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:42,460
Can I use the same time integration scheme I used to solve this discretized differential equation?

77
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,800
Yes?

78
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,800
No?

79
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,800
Yes?

80
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,800
Well, it's dependent on u, so if you have a constant time set, there's a chance that

81
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,800
u might fit through i.

82
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,640
But, it's going to be u.

83
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,640
It's going to be u.

84
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,640
It depends on u.

85
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,640
Remember, I have a j here.

86
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,640
Last time, my lambda is purely real.

87
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,640
This time, my lambda is purely imaginary.

88
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,640
Right?

89
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,640
So, this is my lambda.

90
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,640
For different case, my lambdas are here and here.

91
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,640
This is where my lambdas are.

92
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:19,640
And the maximum I can get, because sine can get to 1 and minus 1, the maximum I can get

93
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,640
is u over delta x.

94
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,640
Okay.

95
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,640
So, that's my lambda.

96
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,640
And, that's the last one.

97
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,640
Okay?

98
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,640
So, I have u over delta x and minus u over delta x.

99
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,640
So, these are my lambdas.

100
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:40,640
And, do you remember where delta t times lambda has to be for forward order to be stable?

101
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,640
So, this is real of lambda.

102
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,640
This is imaginary of lambda.

103
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:52,640
If we multiply by delta t, this will be delta t and delta t.

104
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,640
And, forward order is stable only on this.

105
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,640
Right?

106
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,640
Minus 1, minus 2.

107
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:04,640
Forward order is only stable over this domain.

108
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:12,640
So, we have an unstable situation if we use forward order for this equation.

109
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,640
Okay.

110
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:21,640
You actually expect to get unstable solutions if you use forward order with a central difference

111
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:28,640
discretization of advection scheme, of advection equation.

112
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,640
Is there any part of the analysis that is surprising to you or not clear?
