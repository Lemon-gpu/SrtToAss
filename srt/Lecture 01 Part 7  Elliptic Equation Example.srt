1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So the second equation we are going to look at is another limiting case. So that's actually limiting case number two.

2
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:18,040
An elliptic equation. So that is the case where u is equal to zero and t goes to infinity.

3
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:27,240
We have just said that when u is equal to zero, we get the heat equation.

4
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:36,040
If we have f equal to zero. And as t goes to infinity on that heat equation, we recover a constant.

5
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:42,080
So that is in the case where we don't have a right-hand side f.

6
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:54,800
If we do have a right-hand side f, the equation becomes kappa times partial square u partial x squared plus f is equal to zero.

7
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,880
And we can in general study the case where kappa is equal to one.

8
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:07,880
Because if kappa is not equal to one, as long as it is non-zero, we can divide the whole equation by kappa.

9
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:12,880
And we replace f with f divided by kappa. And we get the same thing.

10
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,880
So let's remove this kappa from this equation and study that.

11
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,880
This equation is called the Poisson's equation.

12
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:40,240
And the solution to that equation can also be analyzed using Fourier series.

13
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:46,240
So in this case, we only have x. We don't have t.

14
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,240
And strictly speaking, this is an OD. We should have d instead of partials.

15
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,240
But most of the time when we talk about Poisson's equation,

16
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,240
we are describing the Poisson's equation as a partial square.

17
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,240
And we are discussing multiple dimensions in space.

18
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:05,240
So let me write this as a partial, even in the one-dimensional space case.

19
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:10,240
We are going to expand u of x using Fourier series again.

20
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,240
k equal to minus infinity to infinity.

21
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:21,240
u hat of k, u to the i kx.

22
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:27,240
And the second derivative is going to become b.

23
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:34,240
So we are going to have minus k is equal to minus infinity to infinity.

24
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:40,240
k square times u hat of k times e to the i kx.

25
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:45,240
Okay. I'm also going to expand f, which can be a function of time,

26
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,240
using Fourier series.

27
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:55,240
We have f hat of k instead of u hat of k for the coefficients of f.

28
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:03,240
Now, matching the two sides of the equation, both using Fourier expansion,

29
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:08,240
we have, if we plus that equal to zero,

30
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:17,240
what we have is k square of u hat of k has to equal to f hat of k.

31
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:24,240
Okay. So what does that mean?

32
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,240
What does this equation mean for k equal to zero,

33
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:34,240
for k equal to a small number, small can include negative or positive,

34
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:43,240
for small absolute value k, and for a large absolute value k?

35
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:48,240
For k equal to zero, we can see that f hat of k has to be zero.

36
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:53,240
Otherwise, we don't have a solution.

37
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,240
That's because the domain is periodic.

38
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:01,240
And as we take t to infinity for the heat equation case,

39
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,240
the f is like a heat source.

40
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:10,240
It's like a source of thermal energy that pumps into the domain.

41
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:16,240
So if you have a non-zero average or a non-zero integral

42
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,240
in the amount of heat you pump into the system,

43
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,240
then the temperature is going to keep increasing to infinity

44
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,240
or keep decreasing.

45
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,240
So if you have a non-zero average or a non-zero integral

46
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,240
in the amount of heat you pump into the system,

47
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,240
then the temperature is going to keep increasing to minus infinity.

48
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,240
You don't have a steady state solution,

49
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,240
which is what this equation is describing,

50
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,240
a steady state solution.

51
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,240
You will only have a steady state solution

52
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,240
if f hat of zero is equal to zero.

53
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,240
So that's the first thing this equation tells me.

54
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,240
f hat, for the other case, it can be arbitrary value.

55
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,240
And then I can have a solution u hat of k

56
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:09,240
is equal to f hat of k divided by k square.

57
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,240
Right.

58
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,240
So it takes the Fourier components of f

59
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,240
and divide it by k square.

60
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,240
Divided by small number for small k

61
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,240
by a big number for big k.

62
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:28,240
This is almost a filtering in space,

63
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,240
a low pass filtering in space.

64
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,240
Because it takes the very high weight numbers,

65
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:40,240
takes the very oscillatory components of f

66
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,240
and decrease that by a large factor

67
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,240
while taking the smoother components of f

68
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,240
and decrease that only by

69
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:56,240
a smaller factor.

70
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,240
So this is a,

71
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,240
some variation of this, this equation

72
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,240
has been used in numerical methods

73
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,240
to serve as a filter, a low pass filter.

74
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,240
And this is called a differential filter

75
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,240
because it uses a differential operator

76
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,240
to achieve the effect of removing

77
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,240
the high frequency components while preserving

78
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,240
the low frequency components.

79
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,240
All right.

80
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,240
So that's the effect of the second limiting case

81
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,240
of time goes to infinity while the u is equal to zero.

82
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,240
Question?

83
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,240
What's the condition that you wrote next to the bracket

84
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,240
when equals zero?

85
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,240
Oh, I'm saying these two terms added together

86
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,240
has to be equal to zero.

87
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,240
Okay.

88
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,240
Yeah.

89
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,240
So that's substituting these into the differential equation,

90
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,240
into the Poisson's equation.

91
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,240
Thanks.

92
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,240
Okay.

93
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,240
Any other questions?

94
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,240
Thanks for clarifying.

95
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,240
Yeah?

96
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,240
Why is there only a steady state solution

97
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,240
if f naught is equal to zero?

98
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,240
Why is there only a steady state solution

99
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,240
when f naught is equal to zero?

100
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,240
This is because if f naught is not equal to zero,

101
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:20,240
okay, so for example, if f is equal to one as a constant,

102
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,240
that means f naught is equal to one and all the other f hats

103
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,240
are equal to zero.

104
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:34,240
If you actually add the time derivative term,

105
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:43,240
so let's actually analyze the other case.

106
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,240
Okay.

107
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,240
So if you write down a partial derivative of t

108
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,240
is equal to kappa partial square u,

109
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,240
partial x square plus f,

110
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,240
and let's say u naught,

111
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,240
u of x, t equal to zero is equal to,

112
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,240
is equal to any, let's say is equal to zero

113
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,240
and f of x is equal to a constant one.

114
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,240
Okay.

115
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:17,240
What is the solution going to be?

116
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,240
Can you just look at the initial condition?

117
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,240
The right hand side and the equation

118
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,240
and guess what the solution should be?

119
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,240
Linear growth.

120
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,240
Linear growth.

121
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:34,240
I would have u of x and t equal to t, right?

122
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,240
That solution is always a constant of in space,

123
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,240
so the second of the derivative in space goes to zero

124
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,240
and the time derivative is always equal to one

125
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,240
which matches the right hand side.

126
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,240
So I would have linear growth.

127
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,240
Okay.

128
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,240
And by the principle of linear superposition,

129
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,240
if you have any initial condition and any f,

130
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,240
as long as the f naught term is not equal to zero,

131
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,240
you can express the solution as a linear combination

132
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,240
of a solution that has f equal to zero

133
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,240
and another solution that is equal to this.

134
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,240
So that solution with f naught is equal to zero

135
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,240
is going to stay bounded

136
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,240
and this solution grows

137
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,240
to infinity.

138
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,240
So when you perform linear superposition

139
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,240
of these two solutions,

140
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,240
you're going to get a solution that goes to infinity.

141
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:34,240
So there doesn't exist a steady state solution.

142
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,240
Yes?

143
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,240
Could you please go to the previous slide?

144
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,240
This might be a very long question,

145
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,240
but the baseline counterline,

146
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,240
isn't that one fully dictating that f naught should be zero?

147
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,240
Because with p equal to zero,

148
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,240
we have zero.

149
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,240
So zero equals f zero.

150
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,240
Yes.

151
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,240
Isn't that just that?

152
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,240
Yes.

153
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,240
That's a mathematical way of answering the question

154
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,240
why f hat of zero has to be zero.

155
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,240
And the physical way to answer the question

156
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,240
is what I was describing.

157
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,240
Yeah.

158
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,240
Any other questions?

159
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,240
So in this case,

160
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,240
f is only an explicit function of x

161
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,240
rather than some function of u?

162
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,240
Oh, yes.

163
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,240
In this case,

164
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,240
f is a function of x only.

165
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,240
It's not a function of u.

166
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,240
Yeah, that's right.

167
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,240
And if f is a function of u,

168
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,240
then especially if f is a nonlinear function of u,

169
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,240
then we get into the field of nonlinear differential equations

170
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,240
that cannot be analyzed using Fourier series.

171
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,240
Yeah.

172
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,240
All right.

173
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,240
Any other questions?

174
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,240
And that's a great case for solving the equation numerically.

175
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,240
Thank you.
