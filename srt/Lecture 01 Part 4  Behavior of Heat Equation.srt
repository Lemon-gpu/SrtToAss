1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,760
So we're going to look at these equations individually, but before that, let's take MATLAB

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:23,720
and look at the evolution, the behavior of this equation as we draw it.

3
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,540
So do you see the fonts clearly enough?

4
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:33,220
Do you see what I'm typing clearly enough?

5
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,380
Okay.

6
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,640
So first of all, I need two parameters, u and kappa.

7
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:45,560
So this is to help you understand the behavior of this equation when the right-hand side

8
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,840
f is equal to zero.

9
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:55,580
So let's look at our first case when u is equal to zero and kappa, let's say, is equal

10
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:56,580
to one.

11
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:57,580
Okay.

12
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:58,500
So let's look at it.

13
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,400
Let's look at this, the behavior of this equation.

14
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:07,020
What I'm going to do is I'm going to ask one of you to come over here and draw a particular

15
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,180
initial condition on the screen.

16
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:15,360
And this is going to demonstrate how the solution is going to evolve as a function of time.

17
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,000
So initial condition is t equal to zero.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,880
And after you draw the solution, you just draw it from the left to the right or from

19
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,200
the right to the left.

20
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,240
And this is periodic.

21
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,340
So the domain is periodic.

22
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:33,020
Whatever is here should also be here.

23
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:37,280
And you should see how the solution evolves as time increases.

24
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,580
So can I have somebody, brave person, to come over here to draw an initial condition?

25
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,580
Please.

26
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,580
Thank you.

27
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,580
What's your name again?

28
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,580
Happy.

29
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,580
Happy.

30
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,580
Okay.

31
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,580
Thank you.

32
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,580
Thank you.

33
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,580
Thank you.

34
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,580
Thank you.

35
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,580
Thank you.

36
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,580
Thank you.

37
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,580
Thank you.

38
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,580
Thank you.

39
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,100
Thank you.

40
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,340
Thank you.

41
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,340
Thank you.

42
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,340
Thank you.

43
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,340
Thank you, Happy.

44
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,340
And the solution you draw, what happens?

45
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:09,100
Can somebody describe to me what happens after Happy draws the initial condition?

46
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,340
It's smooth out.

47
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,340
It's smoothies out very quickly.

48
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,340
Right.

49
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,580
So the solution, Happy went, Happy was drawing the solution.

50
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:25,020
Some people was smiling, laughing because he was drawing a very jaggy, very non-smooth

51
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,020
solution.

52
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,460
And as soon as he pulls the hand, you see the solution is going to be smooth.

53
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:27,720
And you can see that the solution is going to be smooth.

54
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:27,820
Right.

55
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:34,820
So the hand, as time starts to increase, the solution becomes smooth very, very fast.

56
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:35,820
Right.

57
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:36,820
Okay.

58
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,820
Very good.

59
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,500
So, Happy, I want to ask you a question.

60
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:54,820
If I don't want that to happen, if I want the solution to decrease, to smooth out in

61
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,820
a much slower rate.

62
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,820
Okay.

63
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,820
What should I change over here?

64
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,820
I think you should lower the value of kappa.

65
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,820
I should lower the value of kappa.

66
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,820
That's exactly right.

67
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:11,820
So because kappa is multiplied on this second order derivative term, and we are going to

68
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:19,820
see later, it controls how much diffusion or how fast, how strong this term is in smoothing

69
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,820
out the solution.

70
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,820
All right.

71
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,820
So let's change it dramatically.

72
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,820
By a factor of a thousand.

73
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:34,820
And can somebody else come and draw a different solution, initial condition, and see how the

74
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,820
effect is?

75
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,820
Please.

76
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:41,820
I almost got a cramps here.

77
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:47,820
So I'm going to start with this one.

78
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,820
Okay.

79
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:49,820
So this is the initial condition.

80
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,820
I'm going to start with this one.

81
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:51,820
So I'm going to start with this one.

82
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,820
I'm going to start with this one.

83
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:53,820
And then I'm going to start with this one.

84
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,820
So this is a ì»¤ exploit in terms of the spiritual URL system.

85
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,060
So I'm going talk about Lao's

86
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,060
Star using .

87
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:56,520
Sorry.

88
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:56,820
This is a

89
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,820
sou Yummy egg the

90
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:02,820
oy

91
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,820
Or the

92
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,820
Great.

93
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,820
Yes.

94
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,820
I mean, I can open this today.

95
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,820
I can open it and I can have the following.

96
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,820
It says,

97
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,820
And that's what I'm doing.

98
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:29,340
and if you look very carefully you should see for example if you observe

99
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:36,720
here you should see the solution is smoothed out very very slowly right so

100
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,240
this here it is increasing slowly and here for example the peak is going to be

101
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,400
dropping very very slowly so that's the effect of copper when you make copper

102
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:58,100
smaller the strength of the diffusion gets a lot smaller so let's analyze that

103
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:04,020
using what's called a Fourier series
