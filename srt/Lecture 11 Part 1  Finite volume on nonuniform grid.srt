1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Find a volume on non-uniform grid.

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:11,120
Still we have a single spatial dimension, but the space is now divided by a non-uniform set of grid points.

3
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:24,360
So we have x0, we have xn, and we have x1, x2, and the spacing between the axes are no longer going to be uniform.

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:36,080
If you think of the way we formulated finite volume, there is practically no difference between how we are discretizing a uniform grid and a non-uniform grid.

5
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:42,380
We are still going to define a u1 here.

6
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:52,100
So let me rename the grid points to be x of half, x of 1 and half, x and 2 and half, 3 and half, etc.

7
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,340
And this is going to be n and half.

8
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,580
So we still have our volumes being named integers.

9
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,940
Particularly, we define ui as the cell average.

10
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:12,460
Now the cell size is x of i plus half minus x of i minus half.

11
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,020
We no longer have a uniform delta i.

12
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:23,880
So let's call this delta x of i, the size of the ith cell.

13
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:32,740
So we have integration over x i minus half to x i plus half of u times dx.

14
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,040
We have a volume average like that.

15
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,220
Remember, the integral form of the equation applies to any interval.

16
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:52,000
So if we apply the integral form of the equation, we get dui dt would be equal to 1 over delta xi.

17
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,220
The derivative of...

18
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,200
the total amount of quantity inside that volume.

19
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:07,160
The derivative of that is the flux at i minus half minus the flux at i plus half.

20
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,080
Right?

21
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:18,120
Now, we still are going to use finite volume approximation to approximate these fluxes.

22
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:23,460
And the approximation would work in very similar ways.

23
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,860
Okay?

24
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:32,500
And that is going to give us the same kind of finite volume solution as we had before.

25
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,420
So, for example, let's work it out for a very simple scheme.

26
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:50,660
So let's copy the same DTT burgers we worked on in the last lecture to the DTT of a non-uniform grid.

27
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,760
Okay.

28
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,520
Let's try it out.

29
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,560
So we need to get this very simple.

30
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,060
Okay.

31
00:02:54,060 --> 00:03:01,000
We're gonna name it now uniform.

32
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,220
So the input of that we need to make a grid.

33
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:10,720
So let's make a worst possible grid for ourselves.

34
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:19,780
Let's make n equal to let's say 100 and let's just make x to be a random.

35
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:24,140
Is it rand or random?

36
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,600
Rand maybe?

37
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:34,420
Okay so x is basically a random set of points within 0 and 1.

38
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:41,120
Actually I want to make it n-1 because that's the interior points and I want to append 0

39
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,940
and 1 in the beginning.

40
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,440
So x I would make 0 in the beginning.

41
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,760
I want to sort x in the middle and I put 1 there.

42
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:59,080
So if I plot x it's basically a pretty non-ideal set of points.

43
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:05,420
So let me plot x and 0s 101.

44
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,800
Plot it like that.

45
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,120
So this is gonna be our grid points.

46
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,320
In some places it's terrible, some places it's white.

47
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:18,080
Okay so let's try it with that.

48
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,760
Let's make x to be globals.

49
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:26,980
So that I can use this in the function.

50
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:32,940
So let me make global x.

51
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,580
n is still gonna be a length of u, that's right.

52
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:45,040
And dx is now x of 2 to n minus x 1 to n minus 1.

53
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,480
So this is my dx which is no longer a constant.

54
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,160
But a length of 1.

55
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:49,660
Okay.

56
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,020
So I'm gonna make this a length n array.

57
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:59,220
So we are gonna be performing the reconstruction.

58
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:08,460
So for simplicity let's make our reconstruction to be, let's make our limiter to be 0 for

59
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,460
now.

60
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,800
Okay.

61
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,640
Because when we have a non-uniform grid we need to also adapt our limiter with the different

62
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,640
x, i's.

63
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,820
For example when we compute our slope.

64
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,060
So we have a non-uniform grid.

65
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:19,160
Okay.

66
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,460
So we have a non-uniform grid.

67
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:19,560
Okay.

68
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:19,660
So we have a non-uniform grid.

69
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:19,720
Okay.

70
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:19,740
Okay.

71
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,080
So that means we need to also adapt our complete grid, so we have 2 large and common

72
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,520
and single units.

73
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:23,640
Okay.

74
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,020
So we need to also adapt our complete grid.

75
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:24,220
Okay.

76
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:24,500
So we need to also adapt our complete grid.

77
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,580
And also the slope needs to be, the slope needs to be considering half of the delta

78
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:32,800
x in 1 cell plus the half of another delta x in another cell, right.

79
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:39,540
So because if we have a non-uniform grid, the slope from here to here needs to be taking

80
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:44,800
half of the slope, half of the grid size, into adjacent cells.

81
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,460
But let's avoid that complexity for now.

82
00:05:49,460 --> 00:06:06,840
So, if we avoid that complexity, we are going to reconstruct basically our U plus half left

83
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:12,400
is going to be the solution, the cell average on the left of the interface.

84
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,340
U plus half right is going to be the solution cell average at the right of the interface.

85
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:23,720
We are still going to apply good enough scheme and this is going to be dot divide.

86
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:30,780
So everything else is going to be pretty much the same.

87
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:44,580
So in MATLAB, let's compute x center to be x1 to n minus 1 plus x2 to n divided by 2.

88
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,320
And let's say our U0 is sine of x1.

89
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:52,320
So we have 2pi times x center.

90
00:06:52,320 --> 00:07:01,260
If we plot x center, U0, this is still our initial solution, the same as what we had

91
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,320
last time.

92
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:16,640
So now let's solve it using ODE45, DDT non-uniform, 0 to let's say 0.5, using U0 as initial condition.

93
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,080
We have a solution.

94
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:33,320
So let's plot x center and U to see what the solution looks like.

95
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,320
Right.

96
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,320
Okay.

97
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,320
So that's what the solution looks like.

98
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,320
It's still a first order accurate scheme.

99
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,320
And because we have a non-uniform grid.

100
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,320
We have a non-uniform grid.

101
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,320
We have a non-uniform grid.

102
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:54,880
So the amount of dissipation we are experiencing depends on where the sharp feature of the

103
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,080
solution lies.

104
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,880
If the sharp feature of the solution travels through a bigger cell, we experience more

105
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,320
dissipation error.

106
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:07,600
If it travels through a smaller cell, we experience less dissipation error.

107
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:16,080
So the solution goes not...so the dissipation no longer acts as if it's a constant amount

108
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,080
of dissipation.

109
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:23,640
It's a little bit weakly, but like we still get a solution that looks pretty good.

110
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,640
All right.

111
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:31,780
So this is how we can apply finite volume schemes in the non-uniform grid.

112
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:37,680
Really minimum change to what we have to do on uniform grid.

113
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,240
The limiter would require you to do a little bit more work adjusting the different grid

114
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,200
sizes, but still minor change.
