1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,340
So the same person, Godunov, who has proposed the way to reconstruct the flux at interfaces,

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,680
proved an impossibility theorem.

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:21,360
He proved that it is impossible to construct a scheme that is monotonic.

4
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:30,360
So monotonicity means the total variation is less or equal to zero,

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,020
which means the monotonicity of total variation over time.

6
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:41,620
So the total variation has to be monotonically non-increasing over time.

7
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,200
So that's what it means.

8
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,720
And his theorem works for even the simplest conservation laws,

9
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,720
that is, the linear.

10
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,160
Linear advection equations.

11
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,900
And he said a linear one-step second-order accurate numerical scheme,

12
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,220
even for a linear equation, cannot be monotonic,

13
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,560
cannot decrease total variation,

14
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,440
unless the CFL number is integers,

15
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,180
which can only be achieved everywhere

16
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:21,080
if the C is a constant everywhere.

17
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:34,360
So this condition is only feasible for constant C,

18
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,360
which is linear equations.

19
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,360
So an example for this is if this is exactly equal to one,

20
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,360
so if sigma is equal to one,

21
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,360
which means we are discriminating against the C,

22
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,060
and there's a constant C.

23
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:58,080
Well, from the

24
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,840
region,

25
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,860
and here we are,

26
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:07,820
we're perceiving x in ay cross x in divided by t,

27
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,200
and we'reåš•meo2 ay cross c is minus x.

28
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,700
Here's a couple of case studies,

29
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,940
to be Noah's example.

30
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,320
Wheep we're vezes x,

31
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:19,740
next.

32
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,140
Deputy.

33
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:20,440
Cream.

34
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:20,760
Gis.

35
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,220
The distance.

36
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:37,500
So if sigma is equal to 1, that means my delta t times c is exactly equal to delta x, which means this term is going to cancel with this term.

37
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:50,240
What I get is phi of n plus 1i is exactly equal to, and this is exactly equal to phi of n at i minus 1.

38
00:02:51,220 --> 00:03:07,100
So in a space-time solution, so if this is t, this is x, I'm saying the grid points at the next time step is equal to the grid points here.

39
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,880
Which is completely reasonable because the characteristics are exactly aligned with the grid points.

40
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,540
So the solution here is exactly equal to the solution here, and I get exact solution.

41
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:27,580
But this is artificial because this scheme would only work for linear vector equations.

42
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:37,540
This is, I can only set my delta t and delta x to be at a constant ratio.

43
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:44,380
Set my CFL number to be a constant integer only when c is a constant, right?

44
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:51,200
So this is, these are special cases that I can get second-order accurate numeric.

45
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:59,300
So I can only get the same number of numerical schemes that wouldn't work for nonlinear conservation laws.

46
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,920
Right, does that make sense?

47
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:18,720
So, Goodanoff's order barrier theorem says that if you rely on the linear scheme for solving linear equations,

48
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,920
Then you cannot get more than x.

49
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,220
So you have to define first-order accuracy.

50
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:31,220
If you also want to preserve the monotonicity of total variation.

51
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:37,220
So it tells us that we must go to a nonlinear scheme.

52
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:43,220
Okay, we must go to a nonlinear scheme even for solving linear equations.

53
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:49,220
And a nonlinear scheme means if you add two solutions,

54
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,220
You get a solution.

55
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:59,220
You get a flux that is not equal to the summation of the flux getting from these two individual solutions.

56
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:05,220
In a finite volume, that's what it means by a nonlinear scheme.

57
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:10,220
So the Goodanoff's theorem says that if you want second-order accuracy,

58
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:16,220
You can either sacrifice monotonicity, which creates Gibbs phenomenon,

59
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,220
Or you have to go to a nonlinear scheme.

60
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:31,220
Only first-order schemes can have both monotonicity and linearity.
