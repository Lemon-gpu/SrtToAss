1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,620
I think in your project 1, a lot of you are formulating your problem into optimization problems.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,500
And for those of you who were not lucky and you formulated your objective function,

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,840
if you formulated your problem into a very high-dimensional optimization problem,

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,040
you notice that the optimization problem can be very difficult to solve.

5
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:24,560
Low-dimensional optimization problem with a few parameters,

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:32,280
for example, if my n is equal to 2, I should be able to solve these problems with no difficulty.

7
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:40,020
But you can imagine for very complex functions, I may need a large n to have a good approximation.

8
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:45,080
So it's not trivial how to solve general optimization problems of high dimensions.

9
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:52,360
But if I define the distance in a particularly good way,

10
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,360
the optimization problem...

11
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,760
can turn out to be very easy to solve.

12
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:04,860
So, for example, if I define the distance between two functions f and x to be the following.

13
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:15,220
To be the square root of the integral over domain, let's say a and b, f minus x squared.

14
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,840
Maybe I shouldn't use x here.

15
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,180
So f and g, let's say, dx.

16
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,120
Square root.

17
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,840
All right, that's the least squares distance, right, between the functions f and g.

18
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:49,100
Okay, so if I want to minimize over all the possible g's that is in the space big X,

19
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,840
that kind of minimization is called...

20
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,560
a projection.

21
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,560
Because it is looking for the minimum...

22
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,060
Because it is looking for the minimum distance in the L2 sense between f and g.

23
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,560
So let's figure out why is it called projection.

24
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,560
It is called projection because of the following.

25
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,060
So let me say I have one point in space.

26
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,360
Let's say this point.

27
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,560
Like the tip of my pen.

28
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,560
And the space I want to...

29
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,560
The space of g in which I want to...

30
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,560
So let's say this is f.

31
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,560
Okay.

32
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,560
And I want to find a g within...

33
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,560
On the table that has a minimum distance to g.

34
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,560
How should I find it?

35
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:49,560
What is the special relation of that minimum distance g with f?

36
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,560
.

37
00:02:52,560 --> 00:03:01,560
Yeah, I can just drop my pen and the point on which it lands is that g, right?

38
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,560
Or in other sense, I'm drawing an orthogonal...

39
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,560
I'm drawing a line that is orthogonal.

40
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,560
I start with f and I go into the space in an orthogonal way.

41
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,560
Once I hit the space, I find g.

42
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,560
Right?

43
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,560
It's that simple.

44
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,560
.

45
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,560
So the orthogonality can be expressed like that.

46
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,560
Orthogonality to a space...

47
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:37,560
So let's say if I go from f to g, that is g minus f.

48
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,560
g minus f is the vector from f to g, right?

49
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,560
The vector from f to g is orthogonal to the space x.

50
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:55,560
It's defined as for any g prime in x,

51
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:04,560
g minus f times g prime is integrated to zero.

52
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,560
So that's the meaning of orthogonality.

53
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,560
And the reason is the following.

54
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,560
So if I find a particular g that minimizes that distance,

55
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:21,560
it also minimizes the squared distance.

56
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,560
That should be pretty obvious.

57
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,560
Right?

58
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,560
And so let me just call this g star

59
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,560
because g is the result of this optimization problem.

60
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,560
So then for any g, I can express...

61
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,560
Let's define...

62
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,560
So g star is the minimizer.

63
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:55,560
Let's define g prime being the distance between g and g star.

64
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:01,560
Then this can be represented as integral of f minus g,

65
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,560
which is equal to g prime plus g star.

66
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,560
.

67
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,560
Yeah.

68
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,560
g prime minus g...

69
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,560
So yeah, g is equal to g prime plus g star.

70
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,560
d x.

71
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,560
And that, because of the property of the square,

72
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,560
that's very special.

73
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,560
That's why we design our objective function to be f minus g square.

74
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:32,560
I can expand this into f minus g star square

75
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:39,560
minus 2g prime times f minus g star

76
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,560
plus g prime square.

77
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,560
d x.

78
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,560
Right?

79
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,560
So I'm just expanding these perfect squares.

80
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,560
Okay.

81
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,560
And you can see that this term,

82
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,560
because of g prime square integrated,

83
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,560
is always greater than zero.

84
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,560
So as long as I can make the second term

85
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,560
to be equal to zero...

86
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:13,560
So if integration of a times g of g prime

87
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,560
times f minus g star d x is equal to zero,

88
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,560
then the left-hand side is always greater than this.

89
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:29,560
f minus g square d x is equal to integration of a and b,

90
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:37,560
f minus g star square d x plus g prime square d x.

91
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,560
And this is always greater than this,

92
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,560
and it is only equal when g prime is equal to zero everywhere.

93
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,560
Right?

94
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,560
Almost everywhere.

95
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,560
So that means

96
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,560
if I can have this equal to zero for any g prime

97
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,560
in that linear space,

98
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,560
then I know that f...

99
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,560
I know that g star is the minimizer

100
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,560
of this distance function,

101
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,560
distance square, distance function.

102
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,560
Let me write that down.

103
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,560
So...

104
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,560
Which is also saying that

105
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,560
g star minimizes

106
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,560
the squared distance function

107
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:35,560
among all the g's in the linear space.

108
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,560
Right?

109
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,560
So what I have done,

110
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,560
I have transformed the optimization problem.

111
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,560
To an equality problem.

112
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,560
So...

113
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:54,560
So the optimization problem...

114
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,560
Optimization problem has been transformed

115
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:07,560
into an equality problem

116
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,560
for r g prime,

117
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,560
in x.

118
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,560
Okay?

119
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,560
Does it make sense?

120
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,560
And now remember that

121
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,560
if I can express

122
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,560
the x...

123
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,560
If I can express r possible g prime in x

124
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,560
as a linear combination of the basis

125
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,560
of the space x,

126
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,560
then...

127
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,560
I get

128
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,560
a linear equation for numbers,

129
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,560
and...

130
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,560
I also have finitely many numbers.

131
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,560
So the reason for that is...

132
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:55,560
If I can express...

133
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,560
g star is equal to a summation of

134
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,560
i goes from 1 to n

135
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,560
of...

136
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,560
Let's say, ai times x i,

137
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,560
where...

138
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,560
x i...

139
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:18,560
is a basis...

140
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,560
for...

141
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,560
So let me avoid using x.

142
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,560
Let me use phi.

143
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,560
Because x I want to use as space.

144
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,560
It's a basis for phi.

145
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,560
It's a basis for x.

146
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:36,560
Okay?

147
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,560
Then...

148
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,560
this equal to 0 becomes...

149
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,560
Okay.

150
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,560
So also for any g...

151
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,560
So...

152
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,560
If I...

153
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,560
If I enforce this equality for any g prime in x,

154
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,560
and all these phi i's are also in x,

155
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,560
right?

156
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,560
All the basis functions are members of the space.

157
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,560
So...

158
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,560
So this...

159
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,560
I can simply enforce...

160
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,560
that...

161
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,560
phi i...

162
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,560
times f minus...

163
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,560
summation of ai times phi i...

164
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,560
dx...

165
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,560
equal to 0.

166
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,560
And the reason I use phi i here...

167
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,560
So let me just use phi j here,

168
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,560
because I used i for this...

169
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,560
for this summation.

170
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,560
So the reason I substitute phi j...

171
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,560
into g prime...

172
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,560
is because...

173
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,560
if I can have this equation satisfied...

174
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,560
for all the phi j's...

175
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,560
then...

176
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,560
this equation is linear with respect to phi j.

177
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,560
I can...

178
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,560
multiply any b j onto this equation...

179
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,560
and sum over j...

180
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,560
to get...

181
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,560
the same equation for any g prime.

182
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,560
Right?

183
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,560
So then...

184
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,560
if I...

185
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,560
if I have this...

186
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,560
then...

187
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,560
for any g prime...

188
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,560
that can be represented as...

189
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,560
any j goes from 1 to n...

190
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,560
b j times phi j...

191
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,560
the integration of a to b...

192
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,560
of...

193
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,560
b j...

194
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,560
can be pulled out of the integral...

195
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,560
times phi j...

196
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,560
f minus summation of...

197
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,560
a i phi i...

198
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,560
dx...

199
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,560
is equal to 0.

200
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,560
Because...

201
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,560
all the integrals are equal to 0.

202
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,560
So...

203
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,560
a linear combination...

204
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,560
of these integrals...

205
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,560
is for sure equal to 0.

206
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,560
Right?

207
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,560
Questions?

208
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,560
Yeah.

209
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,560
Both g prime and...

210
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,560
g star...

211
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,560
are the same.

212
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,560
They are.

213
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,560
So...

214
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,560
we've already...

215
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,560
taken...

216
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,560
a few more steps...

217
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,560
to get...

218
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,560
the same...

219
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,560
linear space x...

220
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,560
down to the same...

221
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,560
linear space x.

222
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,560
Very good point...

223
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,560
for the projection to work.

224
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,560
So...

225
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,560
now...

226
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,560
remember I have...

227
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,560
transformed...

228
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,560
the optimization problem...

229
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,560
to an equality problem...

230
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,560
for any g prime.

231
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,560
Now I have...

232
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,560
transformed the equality problem...

233
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,560
to...

234
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,560
this...

235
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,560
equality.

236
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,560
Right?

237
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,560
To...

238
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,560
to an equality problem...

239
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,560
for any...

240
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:40,920
equality problem for a finitely many vj's.

241
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:48,460
So here, up to now, I have arrived n equations, one equation for each j.

242
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:55,680
For n unknowns, because the ai goes from 1 to n are unknowns, right?

243
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,640
n equations, n unknowns, that enables me to solve it.
