1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
Okay, now here I'm only using two grids.

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:12,240
How about more? The way to involve more

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:21,480
grids is on here. So here, instead of only

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,520
performing iterations on the cost grid

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,040
calling Gauss-Seidel, I'm going to make a

6
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,520
decision of whether just to Gauss-Seidel

7
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:33,680
or call multigrid further on. So what I

8
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,080
will be doing is that I still initialize

9
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,400
du to zeros and here I have a condition.

10
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:46,160
If the size of RC, let's see the first

11
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,380
dimension, is less than what? First

12
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,040
dimension, if I have a 2 by 2, I mean the

13
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,420
only thing that makes sense for me to do

14
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,500
any iteration would be the size

15
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:04,780
would be less or equal to 4, right? So

16
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:08,040
if the size is equal to 3, that means I

17
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,280
have a single grid point in the middle I

18
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:18,060
want to solve. So then I do that. Else I

19
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,700
do du equal to multigrid of du and RC.

20
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,500
So I'm calling this the same function recursively.

21
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,660
So I'm calling this the same function recursively.

22
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,280
So now let's see what we get.

23
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:38,400
Okay, u is equal to u0 again. For i goes

24
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,260
1, 2, 5. Let's do another five iterations.

25
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:49,800
u is equal to multigrid ue. Okay, I'm

26
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:55,300
done and let's make figure. I am show u

27
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,780
title multigrid.

28
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:03,560
Here is what I get. So this is

29
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,500
this is like the true solution that I

30
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:12,320
have on here and the solution is not

31
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,440
new folder. I want to view the folder. The

32
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,920
solution is coming from an image.

33
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,600
Solution is coming from image airplane dot

34
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,620
outside of. So this is the image and

35
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,580
this is the image I copied for the

36
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,320
solution from and made my right hand

37
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,340
side according to this as an exact

38
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,820
solution. And we see like after five

39
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,680
iterations of multigrid, we get pretty

40
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,080
much the solution right. So if you think

41
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,840
of how many regulations is equivalent to

42
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,720
First of all, the cost grid iterations is

43
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,520
a lot more cheaper and I'm performing 10

44
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,520
iterations on every grid level. So 120 English digits.

45
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:03,800
means there are 10 levels right so 10 times 10 means each multi-grid iteration

46
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:10,800
is like a hundred iterations including from the closest to find it's great and

47
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:22,120
if you didn't have multi-grid and you just performing 500 Gauss-Seidel

48
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:31,600
iterations first of all it will take longer because all of this 500 is gonna

49
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:47,200
be on the finest grid and second if I am show the U title 500 Gauss-Seidel okay

50
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,240
it still hasn't finished but once it finishes you can see that

51
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,100
not finished but it's still going to be on the finest grid and then you can see

52
00:03:52,100 --> 00:04:00,020
the only slower but the effect of 500 Gauss-Seidel is not nearly as good as

53
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:09,420
five iterations of multi-grid still going on okay right 500 iterations of

54
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:16,200
Gauss-Seidel we only get this and with multi-grid we have a cheaper 500

55
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,140
iterations we get almost the exact solution
