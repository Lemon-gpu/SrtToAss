1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,680
So let's start with a simple example of what we analyzed before. So partial u

2
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:16,600
partial t equal to partial v partial x and partial v partial t is equal to

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,360
partial u partial x. So that is the equation derived out of the wave

4
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:31,560
equation. We analyzed I think two lectures before. So once you have such

5
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:37,500
equation and you want to discretize it in a finite domain, what is proper

6
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:45,020
boundary condition to set? Can we use a similar characteristic analysis on that?

7
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:50,600
Yes? No? Does this equation have a single

8
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,340
character?

9
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:58,220
Does it have characteristic speed? Does it have characteristic speed? Well let's take a look.

10
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:05,320
One thing we can do is we can write this as partial partial t of u and v

11
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:16,860
equal to a matrix times partial partial x of u and v. Right? The matrix is just

12
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,580
one one zero zero.

13
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:27,340
A way to analyze the characteristic speed of this equation is by performing

14
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,840
an eigenvalue analysis...

15
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:41,580
...to find out the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix. And what are

16
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:46,860
the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix?

17
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:47,840
One.

18
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,440
Royках?

19
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:48,660
One.

20
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,360
Stein?

21
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:49,660
coordiner?

22
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:49,960
해� ancestral?

23
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,420
k leishman causing? Is there someone who knows this?

24
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:50,460
pych?

25
00:01:50,460 --> 00:02:04,540
eigenvectors. So eigenvectors is basically lambda times the same vector equal to

26
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:12,000
this times the same vector, right? So for example, if I plug in 1 and 1, what do I

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:22,740
get? I get, I mean matrix vector multiplication, I get 1 and 1, right? Okay,

28
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:29,580
so lambda is equal to 1 in that case. What if I multiply the same thing using

29
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:40,440
1 and minus 1? Alright, matrix vector multiplication 1 times 0, 1 times minus 1,

30
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,600
I get minus 1 here.

31
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:49,520
1 times 1 minus 1 times 0, I get 1 here. Which is, if I pull the minus sign out of

32
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:56,420
here, it's equal to minus 1 times the same vector, right? So I get two eigenvalues,

33
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:02,300
1 and minus 1. The corresponding eigenvectors are 1, 1 and 1 minus 1. In

34
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,480
general, it's not obvious, as obvious as this, you need to follow up MATLAB and

35
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,120
put the matrix into this and call eig to figure out what are the eigenvalues I

36
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,540
I

37
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:11,580
I

38
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:18,080
have to find the eigenvectors. But in this case, it's just a 1 minus 1, and we can use

39
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,800
these eigenvectors, use the eigenvectors to recombine this equation to perform linear

40
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:29,420
combinations of u and v to decouple them, make them scalar equations. Why do we need

41
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:38,720
to do that? We are doing that, we decouple these equations so that we know which linear

42
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,520
combination of the,

43
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:49,360
variables should I set on the boundary? Which other linear combination should I

44
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:59,480
leave it alone? Okay? Because, for example, on the left boundary, on the left

45
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:06,280
boundary, the characteristics corresponding to 1, 1, which is, let me do the analysis

46
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,460
here. So this is equal to that, and so the eigenvalues, which are the eigenvalues, are

47
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:16,120
the eigenvectors. So the eigenvalue eigenvector analysis makes it possible for me to express

48
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:28,780
this matrix as a, as a 1 minus 1. So, so, so let me, I don't have enough space to write

49
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:41,400
it down here. So this analysis tells me that if I multiply the same matrix 0, 1, 1, 0, times,

50
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:47,660
not only this 1, 1 vector but also this 1 minus 1 vector. So these two columns are basically

51
00:04:47,660 --> 00:05:01,080
these two eigenvectors. This would give me, this would give me 1 and 1 on the first column

52
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:10,740
and minus 1, 1 on the second column. But if I still write it as, if I still write it as

53
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,240
this, I need to write it as 1 minus 1. So I just need to write it as 1 minus 1. And,

54
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:18,000
I need to multiply this column by minus 1, which can be done by, which can be done by

55
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,820
1, 1, 1 minus 1. If I want to multiply the first column by 1, I want to put a 1 here.

56
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:30,740
If I want to multiply the second column by minus 1, I put a minus 1 here. Right? So this

57
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:37,320
is the proper representation of these, these eigenvalue eigenvectors in matrix. So we want

58
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,580
to insert this matrix.

59
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:50,600
Onto here. So what we want to do is we want to multiply this by 1, 1, 1 minus 1 times

60
00:05:50,600 --> 00:06:02,840
1, 1, 1 minus 1 inverse. Right? Partial, partial t of u, v is equal to the, the matrix

61
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:09,320
times the first matrix is exactly the right hand side of this eigenvalue eigenvector relation.

62
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:09,920
So it is going to be equal to the first matrix.

63
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:18,960
And it is going to be equal to the, to this 1, 1, 1 minus 1 times 1 minus 1. So this is

64
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,300
equal to the left hand side. And I still have an inverse over here. So I still have a 1,

65
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:38,040
1, 1 minus 1 inverse times partial, partial x of u and v. So there is an inverse here.

66
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,660
So if I move.

67
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,360
This matrix two to the left hand

68
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:48,800
side. What I get is a partial partial tee

69
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,620
off. Let me see if I can compute the.

70
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:58,900
Inverse, a, easily, so the inverse this matrix is.

71
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:02,160
The, the determinant is 1 minus 1,

72
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,100
which is minus minus one séins 1,

73
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:08,240
so determinant it's minus two inverse of this matrix.

74
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,120
I should-.,

75
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:16,120
should be the 1 over determinant times...

76
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,120
So I want to switch these.

77
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:26,120
So I still have 1, I still have 1, minus 1 and 1 here. Is that right?

78
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:35,120
No, that's not right. I think I still have 1 here, minus 1 here.

79
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:41,120
If I take the inverse of the matrix, multiply it on the left-hand side and right-hand side of both equations,

80
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:49,120
I get d dt of half of...

81
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,120
So this multiplied by this u and v...

82
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:58,120
Half of u plus v, and the column is...

83
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:04,120
Half of u minus v would be equal to 1 minus 1

84
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,120
times...

85
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,120
Partial x. I also multiply the inverse inside this.

86
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,120
Half of u plus v, half of u minus v.

87
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,120
Right?

88
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:22,120
So this is how we can use the eigenvectors to decouple this equation.

89
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,120
So u plus v over 2 is...

90
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,120
The time derivative is only a function of u plus v over 2.

91
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,120
The time derivative of u minus v over 2 is...

92
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:42,120
Only a function of the same function, u minus v over 2.

93
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:49,120
And the first component, u plus v over 2, propagates at a characteristic speed of plus 1.

94
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,120
The other component, u minus v over 2, propagates at a characteristic speed of minus 1.

95
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,120
So one goes towards the right, one goes towards the left.

96
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:03,120
So let me impose the boundary condition at x equal to 0.

97
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:13,120
On the left side of the domain, which combination of variables should I specify the boundary condition for?

98
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,120
And which combination of variables should I not enforce any boundary condition?

99
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,120
Yes?

100
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,120
Specify for u plus v.

101
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,120
Specify for u plus v, which propagates towards the right.

102
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,120
Alright.

103
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,120
And u minus v should be left alone.

104
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,120
Can u though?

105
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,120
Suppose I only have information about the function u.

106
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,120
What should I do?

107
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,120
I know u minus v should be left alone, right?

108
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:47,120
So I can compute what is locally u minus v.

109
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:53,120
And now if I have the function u, if I have information about function u,

110
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:59,120
and I have the value of u minus v over 2, which comes from inside the domain,

111
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,120
then I know what to set about u plus v.

112
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,120
Right?

113
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:13,120
So the value u minus v, I should grab the information from inside the domain.

114
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:19,120
I have value of u, which I know what it is.

115
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,120
That allows me to set what is u plus v.

116
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,120
And again on the right, I have information, let's say again I have information of u,

117
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,120
and I know what is the value of u plus v from inside the domain.

118
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,120
Right?

119
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:37,120
That allows me to set u minus v over 2.

120
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,120
Good question.

121
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,120
So if you have, if you are doing finite difference scheme,

122
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,120
you know what is the value on the first grid point inside the domain.

123
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,120
Right?

124
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,120
So depending on how many order of, what is the order of accuracy you want to achieve,

125
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:57,120
you can either just take the value of one, like one grid point inside the domain,

126
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,120
or you can take several values and interpolate or extrapolate.

127
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,420
Right?
