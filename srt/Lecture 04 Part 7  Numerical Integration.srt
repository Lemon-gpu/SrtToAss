1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
And one of the things I asked you to do which actually has nothing to do with numerical PDE's per se

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,580
but like is used a lot in numerical methods is I was asking you to

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,720
look at how uniform

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:21,200
the temperature is and I want to also minimize how much water you are using

5
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,960
So the amount of water you're using is a integration

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:33,140
from let's say 0 to T and by the way if you want to compute the average amount of water per unit time you would be

7
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:38,420
dividing that by 1 over T times U of T dt

8
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,460
So if you have a function either analytical or numerical

9
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:48,640
You can you should also be computing the integral

10
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,040
So I want to I want to get a sense of how many people already know how to integrate

11
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:54,680
numerically functions

12
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:54,940
up

13
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,940
, so I want to get a sense of how many people already know how to integrate numerically functions

14
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,940
like that

15
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,600
It's like half of the class so I'll say a little bit on that

16
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,560
The I

17
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:14,940
would only teach one way of doing numerical integration for now that is a

18
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:22,360
trapezoidal rule so if this is UT and this is T equal to 0 this is T equal to big T

19
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,920
if you use a

20
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,980
Something like finite difference you have you did you can discretize the function at

21
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,820
grid points

22
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,820
so 2 Delta T

23
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:38,140
etc up to T is equal to n times Delta T and

24
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,880
You have a function like this and the value of the function is known at these grid points

25
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:54,480
The trapezoidal rule is very simple it is approximating the integral of the function

26
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,220
which is the area under this curve

27
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,300
by many small trapezoids

28
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:08,220
So basically that means linking the every pair of grid points using a straight line

29
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:16,480
Okay, and count how much area is beneath this straight line and this straight line

30
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,620
So for example if you have u0 and u1 and u2 here

31
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,920
What is the area?

32
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,480
behind

33
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,180
This trapezoid where this is 0 Delta T. This is u0 u1

34
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,380
Yes

35
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:52,100
Exactly so that's how much area is under this curve, so how much area is under the summation of all these

36
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,860
all these uh all these uh all these uh

37
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:58,480
Linear lines, what is the summation of all the areas?

38
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,540
It's basically a summation over you can pull Delta T out

39
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:09,540
it's going to be a summation of I goes from 1 to n of

40
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:17,020
Ui minus 1 plus ui so that's a very good approximation of this integral

41
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,180
And if you want you can go back and do Taylor series analysis and convince yourself

42
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,860
This is actually

43
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,640
second-order approximation

44
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,380
Yeah

45
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:39,120
At least the second-order approximation depends on how smooth the function is right so so this is a

46
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,320
This is what you can use to do the projects. I

47
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:51,040
Don't think today. I have time to go to intuitive methods so the rest of 10 minutes. I will see if

48
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,520
Anybody wants to ask additional questions on the project?

49
00:03:54,860 --> 00:04:01,860
I want to say about this one. Yeah, we just focus on continuous functions. So no impulse functions are like periodic ones.

50
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,860
Like as they turn the water on, then it turns off, then it turns back on.

51
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,860
Like you do not have like that at all.

52
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:13,500
It's up to you. It's up to you. So even if you do piecewise continuous functions

53
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:19,840
It's also pretty easy to use this to integrate if you let's say turn this off at this point and turn it on again

54
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,640
You can just focus on integrating this part of the solution.

55
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,640
Right?

56
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:31,740
So there is there is nothing that prevents you to do piecewise continuous functions

57
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,540
And also it also allows you to do non-uniform

58
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:41,940
spacing in time so for example if you use ODE45 to integrate your ODE

59
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,440
ODE45 is going to return you an array of time steps or time points, right?

60
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,680
And there is no guarantee it will return you a uniform array of time points

61
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,600
so instead of having

62
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,800
a constant delta t the modification would be

63
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,780
non constant

64
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:06,260
Delta t would be summation of i goes from 1 to n of delta t i

65
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:14,300
ui plus 1 or ui minus 1 plus ui over 2 so this would be a

66
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:20,320
same integral with non-uniform time steps
