1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,240
Okay, so now I defined my basis functions that way. Let's start to derive the linear form.

2
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:29,260
So I'm going to represent my solution u h being a linear combination of i goes from 1 to n, n being the number of interior grid points of u i times phi i.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,480
Okay, phi i are the piecewise linear and continuous functions I was just visualizing.

4
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,460
So what we need is the bilinear form on a h and v.

5
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:53,660
And here I can substitute v by any of these basis functions v j has to be equal to l of v j.

6
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:58,380
If I have this satisfied, then I can make any linear combination.

7
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:58,840
Let's say.

8
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:06,120
Of these equalities and get the same equality for any v in the same linear space.

9
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,320
Okay, so for j goes from 1 to n.

10
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:25,100
So the left-hand side, I can use the bilinearity of u and expand this by pulling the summation and all the coefficients out.

11
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,200
So it's going to be a summation.

12
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:38,400
Over i u i times a of phi i and phi j is equal to l of phi j.

13
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,040
Right.

14
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:51,140
So then our tasks, our task is to evaluate this and call this a i j and evaluate this and call this b j.

15
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:58,040
Then what I get is the matrix a times my solution u u 1.

16
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,820
And then what I get is the matrix a times my solution u u 1.

17
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,640
And then what I get is the matrix a times my solution u u n.

18
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,280
And then what I get is the matrix a times my solution u u n.

19
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,520
Is going to be equal to the vector b.

20
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:09,920
That allows me to solve for the linear combination coefficients u i.

21
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:15,040
Which turns out to be the height of these basis functions.

22
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,460
Right.

23
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,520
Questions so far?

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,500
Okay.

25
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,500
Now let's figure out how to evaluate these a i j's.

26
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:28,840
So.

27
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,600
Phi.

28
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,200
So a i j is equal to a of phi i phi j.

29
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:36,200
Right.

30
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:44,740
Which is equal to the integral of the domain of the gradient of phi i dot product with the gradient of phi j.

31
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,500
Again, this is going to be a very sparse matrix.

32
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,560
Because let's just go back into MATLAB.

33
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:57,680
And.

34
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:57,760
And.

35
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,280
Visualize this one.

36
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,180
And let's hold on.

37
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,260
Let's make a v also equal to the zeros.

38
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,780
Let's make a v into an arbitrary other.

39
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,540
Let's say a hundred is equal to one.

40
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,140
Let's do another choice of.

41
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,600
Of this with v.

42
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:21,860
Okay.

43
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,060
Right.

44
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,780
So I get two basis functions.

45
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,500
One is the blue one.

46
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,580
One is the yellow one.

47
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,640
So if i and j are equal to one hundred and two hundred.

48
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,960
What is a i j in that case?

49
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,920
It's going to be zero because if we look at the formula for a i j.

50
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:46,740
It is the integral integral of the entire domain of the gradient of phi i times the gradient of phi j.

51
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:52,780
And the gradient of phi i and phi j has no overlap in the areas where they are non-zero.

52
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,380
Okay.

53
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,880
So for example the yellow one is only non-zero in.

54
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,880
One two three four five elements.

55
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,880
Five of these triangles.

56
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,880
The blue one is less clear.

57
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,880
Maybe six.

58
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,880
Yeah.

59
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,880
Blue one I think is six.

60
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,880
But like they are.

61
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:17,880
Each one is only going to be non-zero in the triangles that shares that particular point.

62
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,880
Okay.

63
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,880
So now it's a little bit more complex than the one dimensional case.

64
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,880
In one dimensional case.

65
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,880
And a basic function is only non-zero in two areas.

66
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,380
Okay.

67
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:26,880
So.

68
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,880
It's going to be non-zero in two elements.

69
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,380
Right.

70
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,380
Left and right.

71
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:36,380
In this case each basis function is going to be non-zero in a small number of elements.

72
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,880
But that small number is no longer going to be a constant.

73
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,880
It depends on.

74
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,880
The yellow one has five.

75
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,880
The blue one has six.

76
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,880
Okay.

77
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,880
So but anyway.

78
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,880
These are going to be equal to.

79
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,880
Integration.

80
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,880
It's going to be.

81
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,880
Split that up into summation of elements.

82
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,880
So elements.

83
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,880
So.

84
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,880
Let's say k.

85
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,880
In the elements.

86
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,880
Integration over omega k.

87
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,880
So omega k is the kth triangle.

88
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,880
Gradient phi i.

89
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,880
Gradient phi j dx.

90
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,880
This is good because.

91
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,880
Over each element.

92
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,880
Both.

93
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,880
Phi i and phi j are linear.

94
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,380
So.

95
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:25,880
The.

96
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,880
Gradient phi i and the gradient phi j.

97
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,380
They are.

98
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:28,880
What.

99
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,880
Constant.

100
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,380
Right.

101
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:30,880
So.

102
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,880
Then I can write this as.

103
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,880
Summation of k in the elements.

104
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,880
Gradient of phi i.

105
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,880
In that element.

106
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,880
With gradient of phi j.

107
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,880
In that element.

108
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,880
Times the area.

109
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,880
Of that element k.

110
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,880
Okay.

111
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,880
So.

112
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,880
So.

113
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,880
So.

114
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,880
So.

115
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,880
So.

116
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,880
So.

117
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,880
So.

118
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,880
So.

119
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,880
So.

120
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,880
But.

121
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,740
Up to now.

122
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,120
All calculus.

123
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,520
Is.

124
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:00,880
Gone.

125
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,880
Only thing left is.

126
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,420
Geometry.

127
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,540
And algebra.

128
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,640
Alright.
