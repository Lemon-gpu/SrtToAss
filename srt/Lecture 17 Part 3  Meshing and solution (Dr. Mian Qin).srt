1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,500
So now we finished defining physics number one, I can move on to the mesh node.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:10,300
There is always going to be a default mesh. If I click on build all, it will build me a mesh.

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:15,500
And I could actually look at the details by right-click and edit physics-induced sequence.

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:23,000
So in this case, this particular free tetrahedral mesh was generated with the sequence with some predefined level of normal.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You could, you know, further refine it or make it coarser.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You could also more accurately control it via the custom option and define what's the maximum, minimum mesh size,

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and also what is the growth rate and curvature.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
If there's narrow region, how many layers on average you want to have in terms of mesh in that narrow region.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So in this case, it's a uniform size everywhere in the entire domain.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
But of course, we know that's not always the most effective way or efficient way of meshing.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
For example, if you do have a high gradient close to a certain,

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
surface, we know that there is a lot of say like electric double layer in that region and the concentration gradient is really high.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Then what happens is you do want to further refine the mesh close to that particular surface.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So in that case, I could add a size node under the free tetrahedral and choose the size node to control on the boundary level.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So the levels here are domain 3D boundary, in this case is 2D and 1D and 0D for the adjunct point.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Of course, you have a different definition.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So you can have a different definition of domain where you have a 2D geometry.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Then the boundary is actually an edge.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So in this case, we're going to say I want to refine the mesh close to this boundary number 1.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I want to use the extra fine mesh here.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So you see that the mesh around the surface is actually refined.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Of course, you can see even better with the further refine.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And then you can change that to mesh size node as well.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And this is the mesh number 1.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
If you do say,

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I know this geometry is actually,

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
extrusion geometry,

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
so it has the same thickness everywhere.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What if I want to use a different mesh type?

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So you can right click on a component 1,

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
add a different mesh.

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So now you have mesh number 2.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Say I actually want to use a free,

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
let's do a free triangular mesh on the side surface.

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And then I could add a swept mesh for the domain.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And for the sweeping,

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I want a distribution of 10 layers.

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So why is this useful?

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So if you do have a high gradient in the y direction,

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
and less gradient in the x and z direction,

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
so this way it allows the mesh to be,

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
element to be still very reasonable,

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
only, you know, 480 domain elements.

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
But meanwhile, you have much better resolution in the y direction.

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So if there is a high gradient,

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
you can resolve it.

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And also, when you have a very thin structure,

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
then you do not want to use too fine a mesh that's combined,

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
confined by the,

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
the,

51
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
the,

52
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
the,

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
the,

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
confined by the smallest dimension you have.

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
In this way,

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
you can actually match the thin structure fairly well.

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And meanwhile, keep the mesh element size

58
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
on the other dimensions reasonable.

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
All right.

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So just the,

61
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
the other mesh options,

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
of course, are available through the right click of the mesh as well.

63
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So you see, for fluid flow,

64
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
one of the very useful features is a boundary layer mesh.

65
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So especially when turbulence happens,

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
you do want to resolve the wall regions,

67
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
the close to the wall,

68
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
you know,

69
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
the boundary layer mesh.

70
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And you can also use the boundary layer mesh to

71
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
find the boundary layer mesh.

72
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So that's where you can define the boundary layer mesh and specify how many layers you want,

73
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
how much do they stretch per layer,

74
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
adjacent layer,

75
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
and then what is the initial layer thickness.

76
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So it is actually a default option.

77
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
We have a fluid flow physics and the default mesh controlled physics would have the boundary layer added already.

78
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
All right.

79
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So that's about the mesh.

80
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Then we can look at a study.

81
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So right now there is a study,

82
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
step one,

83
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
stationary,

84
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
and stationary solver.

85
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
If you do want to look at a solver settings,

86
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
you can show default solver.

87
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
We can expand it and see that's the dependent variable we're solving for.

88
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
We know that in the model wizard,

89
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
the component one dot V,

90
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
uppercase V,

91
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
we're just directly uppercase V.

92
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
That's the actual potential.

93
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's a stationary solver we're using.

94
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
There is a relative tolerance that's been specified here.

95
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
There is,

96
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
you can,

97
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
whether to show the results while the solver is moving.

98
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So that's actually useful

99
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
when you have a longer computational time

100
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
and you can see what's the current solution

101
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
without waiting until the end.

102
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
There is a,

103
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
let's see what other things you need to know.

104
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The fully coupled solver is the one that's being used right now.

105
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's using a linear solver of iterative solver

106
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
and more iterative solver details right here.

107
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's a multigrid solver with some pre-smoother,

108
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
post-smoother,

109
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
and core-smoother.

110
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So most of the time you don't have to change the default solver.

111
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Especially so far as you know,

112
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
this is a linear problem.

113
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So we know already that it's going to solve in one iteration.

114
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
All linear problems solving in one iteration

115
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
because you go down a tangent

116
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
and you go through the straight line

117
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
and you find that solution

118
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
or error estimates to the minimum

119
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
directly through that one iteration.

120
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So it's a mump solver that's being used now.

121
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The other direct solver includes the

122
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Parisol, Spools, and Dense Matrix solvers.

123
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And let's see what else.

124
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So basically a lot of times you do want to,

125
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
and the nonlinear method is a Newton-Raphson iteration.

126
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So you already know that.

127
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Let's see.

128
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So I would say the tolerance,

129
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
the termination technique right now is by default

130
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
is set to be tolerance.

131
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So basically you can choose between tolerance or iterations.

132
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
So either, for example, terminates after 25 iterations

133
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
or when the tolerance criteria is met.

134
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So the two concepts here is the relative tolerance

135
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
and the nonlinear.

136
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And then the absolute tolerance.

137
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So the loser of the two is going to be in effect.

138
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And then when you do want to refine the solution,

139
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
you do want to refine, for example,

140
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
type of extra zero here,

141
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
you know, to tighten the tolerances.

142
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
But of course that comes at a cost of

143
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
more computational cost.

144
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So it's always a balance between the two.

145
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So in this case we all know it's going to solve.

146
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So we're going to right click on study one and hit compute.

147
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
So here it shows the program.

148
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And here it shows how much physical memory

149
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
and the virtual memory that's in use.

150
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And now we solve for the potential, how it disputes.

151
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
By default comes already generated a plot group for me.

152
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Just to show you how this works,

153
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
you can always right click on results,

154
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
add a 3D plot group.

155
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And in the 3D plot group,

156
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
you can add any type of a plot

157
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
that you think would be able to nicely visualize this.

158
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
For example, instead of the slice plots,

159
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
the multi-slice plot,

160
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I could do a single slice.

161
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
In the, let's do a xy plane.

162
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Actually a yz plane.

163
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
And just one slice.

164
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So this is how the potential looks like

165
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
in the cross-section.

166
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I could make the slice interactive

167
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
and basically just scan through the geometry

168
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
to see what is the local potential distribution.

169
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You could also do like a,

170
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
just a cross-section xz plane

171
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
of one slice.

172
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
So that shows the total.

173
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So that shows you where the potential goes from 0

174
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
to the other end,

175
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
the higher end, 0.2 volts.

176
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
On top of the slice plot,

177
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
you could also add, for example, an arrow volume.

178
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So I'm going to use the arrows to show how the current flows.

179
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So I'm going to use maybe 20 points in the x direction,

180
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
just one point in the y direction,

181
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
and 10 points in the z direction.

182
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So now I have the arrows flowing from the high potential end

183
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
to the low potential end.

184
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
The direction of the arrow, of course,

185
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
is where the density goes, the current flows.

186
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And then the length of the arrow

187
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
is actually proportional to what is the local density.

188
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
There is some singularity around the shoulders

189
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
because of the sharp transition.

190
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
The electric currents cannot make a perfect sharp turn

191
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
because the divergence has to equal to 0.

192
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So you can also, for example,

193
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
add on top of the arrow volume a color expression.

194
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Say use the color to represent what's the current density.

195
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
So you can type in a replace expression

196
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
and find the current density norm.

197
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So now the color actually shows what's the magnitude.

198
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You can change the color table

199
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
so that it doesn't mix with the other one.

200
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So different visualizations you can do.

201
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Any questions?

202
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
What we have done so far with the single physics problem?

203
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
All right.
