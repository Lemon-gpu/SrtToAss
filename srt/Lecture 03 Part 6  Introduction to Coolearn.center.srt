1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
So this is a previous project done in Virginia Tech, so in another university.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:12,760
So basically, you have a code that is going to evaluate your solution.

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,720
So you can look at the project description over here.

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,100
So this is a demo project.

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,460
Please write a function with a function name, computer lab 5.

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:29,720
So whatever you write, the function name should be the same as what the project name is,

7
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,740
which in this case is computer lab 5.

8
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,940
And you can see that this code calls the computer lab 5, which is the function you wrote.

9
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,360
And then it assesses the result.

10
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:50,200
If it's not equal to, this is a dummy case, if it is not 256, it tells you your solution is wrong, otherwise it's right.

11
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:58,080
So for example, you can come into the room, you can say code up takes one x,

12
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,640
and you say, okay.

13
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:04,840
My result, you need to say result is equal to computer lab 5.

14
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,160
So the syntax is the same as what you would do in MATLAB.

15
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,720
Say 256.

16
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,420
Somebody is also, okay.

17
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,020
Then you can run it.

18
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,360
It says your answer is right.

19
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:24,360
So I see a lot of people are in the room, so can you just change the result to something else and run it?

20
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:24,440
Okay.

21
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,700
T-plant.

22
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,180
Yeah, 25.

23
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,080
And yeah, it says your result is wrong.

24
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,280
So click this one to look at the result.
