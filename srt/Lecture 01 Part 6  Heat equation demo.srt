1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,740
So let's draw this case. Even if I draw a very jaggy case, the solution decays.

2
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,900
And you can see different components decay at different rates.

3
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,420
The very jaggy components decay very, very fast.

4
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,160
And the relatively smooth components decay very slowly.

5
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:43,520
And at this point, it looks almost like a constant plus a small amplitude sinusoidal wave.

6
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,920
A sinusoidal wave is k equal to 1 and minus 1, right?

7
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:53,680
So at this point, and the k equal to 1 and minus 1,

8
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,600
they decay this.

9
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,660
This is among the slowest decaying components of the Fourier series.

10
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,680
And even that slowly decays at the end, we're going to see it's going to be a constant in space.

11
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,520
So that is the behavior of the heat equation in periodic domains.

12
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:15,560
All right.

13
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:21,720
Any questions?

14
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,480
Pardon?

15
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,100
Can I have kappa to be positive?

16
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,660
Can I have kappa to be, you mean negative?

17
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,460
So here, yeah, so here the kappa is positive.

18
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,180
If you have kappa to be negative, what happens?

19
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:49,660
Instead of exponential decay, you have exponential growth, right?

20
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:54,580
That means if you have a sign error in your code,

21
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,740
that makes kappa somehow negative, what are you going to have?

22
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,100
You're going to have infinity pretty soon, okay?

23
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:13,820
Because for the larger case, the exponential growth now is going to be very, very fast.

24
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,540
Actually, the finer the mesh is, which means the larger k can be containing your solution,

25
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,640
the faster you are going to grow to infinity if you have a negative k.

26
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:32,720
So that can be, that is the result if you have a negative k, okay?

27
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,980
Exponential growth is very fast.

28
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,760
In a computer, within a few iterations, you are going to see numbers like 10 to the 100,

29
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:46,040
10 to the 200, and the floating points can only go up to 10 to the,

30
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,060
double precision floating points can go to 10 to the 300.

31
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,520
And beyond that, you're going to get infinity, okay?

32
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:53,640
Okay.

33
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,580
Okay.

34
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,640
That's what you're going to see in computer code.

35
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,000
And if you do some operations with infinities, you're going to get not a number.

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So in your code, I'm sure at some point you are going to see infinities and not a numbers.

37
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,340
That can be a cause of exponential growth,

38
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,540
very fast exponential growth in your computer code.

39
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:20,960
All right.

40
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,480
Any other questions?

41
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,400
Okay.
