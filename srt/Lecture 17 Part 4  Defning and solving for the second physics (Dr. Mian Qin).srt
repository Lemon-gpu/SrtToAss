1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,940
One second. Yep, back to the presentation. So far we solved a very easy linear single physics problem.

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,020
So next thing we're going to introduce the second physics by right-clicking on component 1.

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,840
The entire thing is called a model, and if you save it, it's called a .mph, the multi-physics file.

4
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:23,580
Right now we have one component, but you could actually right-click on the root, add more components,

5
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,260
and the second component can be any dimension. It doesn't have to be the same as the first component.

6
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,260
The use of that, I can think of one, for example, if you have a laser heating problem.

7
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:40,260
You have a block of materials, a 3D coffee mug like this, and laser cutting it from the top cover,

8
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,260
and the laser penetrates a certain depth. So what I'm actually curious about laser heating is

9
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:49,260
how the heat distribution is going to be like through the depths in the 1D.

10
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:56,260
So I could solve that 1D heat, for example, a Gaussian curve or something, distribution across the z direction,

11
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,260
and then the 3D actual heat distribution.

12
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,260
So I could have actual heat conduction, convection, radiation in the 3D mug.

13
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:09,260
So that way I could have a 1D component coupled with a 3D component instead of solving everything in 3D.

14
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:13,260
All right, and then within each of the components, you could have any number of physics.

15
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,260
So, so far we have one. We could add a second one.

16
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:21,260
Sometimes you could grab a whole bunch of physics from the very first step when they interact with the model wizard.

17
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:27,260
I'm just showing how the workflow and I want you to understand each physics correctly before we move on to the next one.

18
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,260
So I'm doing it one by one.

19
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:32,260
So the second physics I'm going to choose is a heat transfer physics.

20
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:36,260
So it's on the heat transfer folder called heat transferring solid.

21
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:40,260
Again, I right click, add it to the component.

22
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:44,260
And then I could close the physics panel here.

23
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:46,260
So the second physics is added here.

24
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:50,260
As I mentioned, the sequence of physics doesn't matter, so you can actually drag them around.

25
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,260
You could pretty much drag everything around.

26
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:56,260
For example, the binary condition sequences, but you need to pay more attention to that one.

27
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:59,260
You know, make sure it's the correct settings.

28
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,260
So this is what I mentioned is the same workflow for any physics.

29
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,260
So you work with the actual currents. You know how it's like.

30
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,260
Now you look at heat transferring solids.

31
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:12,260
You have the same three D4 nodes, a domain condition, a boundary condition, and an initial value.

32
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:18,260
So the domain condition is the, you know, some conduction equation, the Poisson equation here.

33
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:22,260
And then a boundary condition D4 is thermal insulation everywhere.

34
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,260
So we know we're going to replace some of that.

35
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,260
So I'm going to right click on heat transfer.

36
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:31,260
When I case the heat transfer Ukrainies solid at first of all heat source, remember we have a heat source fromley

37
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,260
80.

38
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,260
Coming from air current and physics.

39
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:39,260
So I'm going to assign the volumetric heat source to the entire domain once everywhere in domain one.

40
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:47,260
Have this key source and what's the amount of the source you can either use to drop down comes to a smart enough to know DAD's you have.

41
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,260
Curve physics.

42
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,260
You have a heat transfer.

43
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,260
You probably want to do this.

44
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:55,260
The electromagnetic heating is a volumetric heat source, or you could type in the variable that you can look up.

45
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,260
OK.

46
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:00,500
either through, there's two ways of looking inside of

47
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,500
COMSOL variables, what are the internal variables that's being used. One is to

48
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,580
toggle on the equation view by clicking on the eye icon here. Then each of

49
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,540
the physics nodes you could actually expand. Then for example, if we

50
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:16,360
go back to electric currents, the current conservation here, all the internal

51
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,280
variables with descriptions are listed here. And I already know that it's

52
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,460
ec.qrh, that is the volumetric heat source

53
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:28,460
I want to type in. So I could type that here, ec.qrh.

54
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:32,460
So that will be

55
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:36,460
essentially the same. Or if I want a certain magnitude of that, I could write

56
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:40,460
the expression based on ec.qrh as well. So anything you want.

57
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:44,460
And what else I want to say. So the

58
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:48,460
variables can also be found through the post processing steps.

59
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:52,460
So for example, you could actually add a complete report, write a report

60
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,460
in the HTML format or a web format, and then you could actually

61
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:58,460
add a document format. You'll have all the information of the internal

62
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:02,460
equations from different physics and the expressions and the units

63
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:06,460
and everything. So that's another way of looking at those information.

64
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:10,460
Going back to the heat transfer physics, so

65
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:14,460
we define a heat source. The other things we want to do is change the

66
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:18,460
default boundary conditions. So I could right click, add a

67
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:22,460
heat flux condition. I'll grab all boundaries.

68
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:26,460
So the drop down has all boundaries. And say it's a convective heat flux

69
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,460
with a heat transfer coefficient of 5, the handbook value.

70
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:34,460
And the external temperature, just the room temperature, 20 degrees C.

71
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:38,460
And then I'm going to choose

72
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:42,460
a fixed temperature condition on surface number 1 and 10.

73
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:46,460
I'm going to make a selection out of these two, call them the feet.

74
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:50,460
So later on if I want to refer to both boundaries, I could just use the

75
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:54,460
drop down to choose feet instead of finding those boundaries again.

76
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,460
Sometimes we see customers, especially industrial level models with thousands of surfaces,

77
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:02,460
then it's almost necessary, very necessary to group the

78
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,460
surfaces and that'll help with the

79
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:10,460
workflow a lot. So the two is going to

80
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:14,460
glue to the heat sink, so it's going to be fixed at room temperature also.

81
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,460
And that fixed temperature condition will replace the heat flux condition here.

82
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,460
Another thing that we want to do is change the heat transfer coefficient.

83
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:24,460
Another way of coupling these two is through the multi-physics node.

84
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:28,460
So we have basically a central place to control those types of

85
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:32,460
coupling through the multi-physics node.

86
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,460
Depending on the two physics you have added so far, you could have

87
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:40,460
potentially electromagnetic heating, which is the dual heating. You could have

88
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:44,460
thermal electric effects, and you could have boundary

89
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,460
effects and also discharge heat source.

90
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,460
So some kind of a heat transfer coefficient.

91
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:54,460
And then you could add the plasma effect as well.

92
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:58,460
So the DC plasma.

93
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:02,460
So basically you can, instead of adding the heat flux under the physics node

94
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:06,460
of heat transfer, you could add that in the global sense here by just

95
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:10,460
adding the electromagnetics assigned to domain one. So those two would be essentially

96
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:14,460
equivalent. You could disable just one of them.

97
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:18,460
And yeah, the mesh should still be good. Now the stationary step will be solved

98
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:22,460
by adding the heat transfer coefficient.

99
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:26,460
So I'm going to right click on study, hit compute again.

100
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:30,460
So the progress actually shows you how many iterations and what's the

101
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:34,460
error estimate. And now it gives you the solution very quickly.

102
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:38,460
So I'm going to add a new plot group. You could change the previous

103
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:42,460
one as well. And I'm going to add a surface

104
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:46,460
plot of temperature, which is uppercase T.

105
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:50,460
And then you could also use the replace expression here.

106
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,460
A better color for thermal, I usually like the thermal light.

107
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:58,460
Oh, I choose the wireframe. Let me disable that.

108
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,460
So basically the coldest part is the feet.

109
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:06,460
And then the hottest spot is right here in the middle of the beam.

110
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:10,460
So that's it for the heat transfer physics. Any questions?

111
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:14,460
So we used some of the existing information from the

112
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:18,460
first physics for the second one. So far it's a one-way coupling between

113
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:22,460
those two physics. If you do want to introduce the reverse coupling,

114
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:26,460
let's do a little experiment here. The material properties,

115
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:30,460
as you see for titanium, is by default constant from that building

116
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:34,460
folder. So the actual conductivity, as we mentioned,

117
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:38,460
right now is a constant. If we make it a linear function

118
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:42,460
in temperature, 1 minus 0.001 times T,

119
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:46,460
and I'm going to use the square bracket just to neutralize

120
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,460
the units in the temperature so that everything in this later part of the equation

121
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:54,460
is a dimensionless number. So now basically I'm saying that

122
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:58,460
the electric conductivity decreases as temperature goes up. So what do you

123
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:02,460
think the maximum temperature would be? So right now we have

124
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:06,460
700 and around 80. Let me actually

125
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:10,460
add a maximum volume

126
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:14,460
of temperature so we know exactly what's the peak temperature here, which is

127
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:18,460
786.8. So after I change the electric conductivity,

128
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:22,460
I haven't computed it yet. So what's your guess? Who thinks the temperature

129
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:26,460
will go up? Who thinks the temperature

130
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:30,460
will go down? Okay, so the remaining people think the

131
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:34,460
temperature will remain unchanged. Let's test that.

132
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:44,460
Alright, so go back to that 3D plot. So now

133
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:48,460
the peak temperature is actually 568. It decreased by about 200k.

134
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:52,460
And why?

135
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:56,460
Remember in the heat transfer equation, which part now changed?

136
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:00,460
The heat source, right? The heat source is

137
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:04,460
EC dot QRH. Let's take a look at EC dot QRH.

138
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:08,460
Which is

139
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:12,460
right here. Basically it's EC dot

140
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:16,460
JX times EX plus the Y and Z components.

141
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:20,460
And if you look up the JX definition, it's sigma

142
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:24,460
times EX, right? So basically when the conductivity goes down,

143
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:28,460
the heat source goes down. The EC dot QRH is proportional to

144
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:32,460
the local conductivity times the field squares.

145
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:36,460
Of course the field doesn't change because we haven't changed the applied potential.

146
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:40,460
So the potential divided by distance doesn't change either. But the

147
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:44,460
conductivity goes down. So the whole source goes down and then the temperature goes down.

148
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:48,460
So this is actually, if you think a little bit about the physics, you could

149
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:52,460
with a little bit more time given, you can definitely arrive at the same conclusion

150
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:56,460
as the program gives you, which is a lower temperature. But what happens

151
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:00,460
if we change another thing? Say the thermal conductivity right here.

152
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:04,460
We can make it a physical expression. It's actually thermal conductivity

153
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:08,460
which goes as an exponential function in temperature.

154
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:12,460
Like EXP minus T divided by something. And then what's going to happen?

155
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:16,460
So the heat is going to dissipate slower and then it's going to accumulate a little bit

156
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:20,460
faster. And those, basically it'll be a computing mechanism

157
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:24,460
with the decreased conductivity. So we have more nonlinear

158
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:28,460
factors showing up in your model and they contribute to the model in different ways.

159
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:32,460
It's more difficult to predict what the actual results would be. So that's when the simulation

160
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,460
actually comes in handy to give you a version of the model.

161
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:38,460
So that's a very simple control experiment of what's going to happen.

162
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:42,460
Of course you have to make sure you are implementing the right thing and don't do typos.
