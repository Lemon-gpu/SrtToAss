1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,880
A total variation, I usually write as Tv, is equal to integral over the entire domain.

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,140
So if the domain is from 0 to L, I'm integrating between 0 and L.

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,600
If the domain is between A and B, I'm integrating between A and B.

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,080
The absolute value of du dx times dx.

5
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:34,440
So total variation, of course, is a function of T, because I integrated over X, I did not do anything about T.

6
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:39,740
You change that as a function of T, so the total variation also changes as a function of T.

7
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,500
So what does that mean?

8
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:50,520
Let's take a look at the total variation, first of all, for monotonically increasing function.

9
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,060
So can somebody tell me, if I have a monotonically increasing function,

10
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:00,120
what does this total variation mean to you?

11
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,580
Can you visualize it?

12
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,260
Or can you compute it?

13
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:06,960
Yes?

14
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,100
It's just u of L minus u of 0?

15
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:09,860
Yes.

16
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:16,800
If du dx is positive, monotonically increasing, this is just the u of L minus u of 0.

17
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,660
It's the highest point in the function on the right-hand side minus the lowest point on the function on the left-hand side.

18
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:23,600
Right?

19
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,060
Okay, so what if it's monotonically increasing?

20
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,500
It's gonna be u of 0 minus u of L, right?

21
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:34,120
So still the highest point of the function minus the lowest point in the function.

22
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,340
Now the tricky part.

23
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:43,380
What if the function is increasing from 0 to some point in the middle of the domain then decreasing from there now?

24
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:46,580
You can break the domain into these two parts.

25
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:52,340
On the first part, the integral is equal to the highest value of the function minus u at 0.

26
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,740
On the second part, it's still equal to the highest value of the function minus u at 0.

27
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,060
On the third part, it's still equal to the highest value of the function minus u at 0.

28
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:58,560
Right?

29
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:06,000
So if I have, in general, if I have a function that is increasing, decreasing, increasing, decreasing, increasing, decreasing.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,500
Okay?

31
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,000
What is the total variation?

32
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,720
You can use the same logic.

33
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,520
Break the function apart into monotonic regions.

34
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:25,200
It is basically this value, the absolute value of this range plus the absolute value of this, plus the absolute value of this, plus the absolute value of this, and so on.

35
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:25,700
ï¿½

36
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,820
So that's why it is called total variation.

37
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,960
The total amount of variation of that function.

38
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:47,520
And I claim, in a scalar conservation law, the total variation is not conserved.

39
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:52,980
It does not increase, it can only decrease.

40
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:55,400
Okay?

41
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:04,380
And to see this, we first, we can look at the same function and think of, for example,

42
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,400
for Berger's equation, how would this initial condition evolve?

43
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,240
And for any conservation law, how would this function evolve?

44
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,260
So here we don't have any discontinuity, right?

45
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:19,820
So the function would just evolve according to the local wave speed.

46
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:26,500
So for example, for Berger's equation, positive side would evolve towards the right.

47
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,720
So let's say this is zero.

48
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,400
Negative side is going to evolve towards the left.

49
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,740
Positive side is going to evolve towards the right.

50
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,400
And get negative side, positive side.

51
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,260
The function would evolve like that.

52
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:45,960
But I'm never going to create any new extremists, right?

53
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,720
So after some time, the function is going to be like that.

54
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:53,980
But no new extremer is going to be created.

55
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,160
The monotonically increasing region of the function,

56
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,620
if you bond it between the local maximum and local minimum,

57
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,300
it's just the location of this maximum and minimum is moved.

58
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:14,020
In between, if it's originally monotonically increasing, it's still monotonically increasing.

59
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:19,640
If it's originally monotonically decreasing, it's still monotonically decreasing over the same range.

60
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:25,360
So the total variation is the same if the solution stays continuous.

61
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:38,040
So Tv stays constant if u is smooth.

62
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,600
Okay?

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,280
What if u is not smooth?

64
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,240
Now we can see a shockwave, let's say, is forming over here.

65
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,440
What happens after a while?

66
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:59,400
What happens when the local maximum and minimum starts running into the shockwave?

67
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,620
What if the shockwave, what if this point keeps running towards the right,

68
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,060
this point keeps running towards the left, and they run into the shockwave?

69
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,540
Yes, the maximum starts to decrease.

70
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:15,340
So when I get to this point, I'll have the maximum only over here,

71
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:18,800
because this maximum point has already disappeared into the shockwave.

72
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,300
Okay.

73
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,820
The shockwave is like a black hole.

74
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,700
It just absorbs things.

75
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:33,260
And when the minimum runs into the shockwave, the minimum, the original minimum disappears

76
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:39,100
and is replaced by a less negative minimum.

77
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,180
And I also have things like this.

78
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:44,700
Right.

79
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,800
So the maximum decreased the minimum increase.

80
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,920
The total variation is diminished.

81
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,640
If u is discontinuous.

82
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,800
So in both cases, no matter if u is smooth or not smooth,

83
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:13,420
the total variation is going to be non-increasing over time.
