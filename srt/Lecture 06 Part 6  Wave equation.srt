1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,600
An example I want to give is the so-called wave equation.

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:12,480
So the wave equation doesn't look like a system of equations in the beginning, but somehow it is.

3
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:19,980
The wave equation is an equation involving a second-order derivative in time.

4
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:27,460
Okay, so if we have a first-order derivative, it is the heat equation.

5
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,060
It is a parabolic equation.

6
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,480
It means the function u is going to diffuse out after time.

7
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,740
But if we have a second-order derivative in time, the equation behaves completely differently.

8
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:49,740
To see that, let us use two auxiliary equations.

9
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:55,020
Let's do phi and psi.

10
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,040
So let's introduce these two variables.

11
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:10,160
And phi is defined as the derivative of u to t, and psi is defined as the derivative of u to x.

12
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:16,960
So, first of all, just by their definition,

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,960
we know that partial heat is going to be equal to the derivative of u to t.

14
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:19,980
So we know that partial heat is going to be equal to the derivative of u to x.

15
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:28,240
So we know that partial psi, partial t, is equal to the partial square of u, partial x, partial t, right?

16
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,480
Just by definition of psi.

17
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:38,020
Which is actually equal to partial phi, partial x, also by the definition of phi.

18
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:42,280
So that's one equation we obtained through the definition.

19
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:42,960
Okay.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,280
Another equation.

21
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,980
Another equation we can obtain is from the equation.

22
00:01:52,980 --> 00:02:02,980
So the equation partial square u, partial t square can be written as a time derivative of a time derivative,

23
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,400
which is time derivative of phi.

24
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:14,940
It is equal to the spatial derivative of u,

25
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:19,300
which is spatial derivative of spatial derivative, that is, partial psi.

26
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,300
Partial x.

27
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,300
All right.

28
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:28,300
So, we have these two equations, and we can write them down together.

29
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,300
Partial psi, partial t is partial phi, partial x.

30
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:36,300
Partial phi, partial t is equal to partial psi, partial x.

31
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,300
What an interesting system.

32
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:46,300
It corresponds to our previous example where this matrix,

33
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,300
where this matrix,

34
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:55,300
u11, u12, u21, u22 is equal to what?

35
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:05,300
0, 0, because the psi time derivative does not depend on psi spatial derivative.

36
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,300
And the phi time derivative doesn't depend on phi spatial derivative.

37
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,300
They only have a coupling term.

38
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,300
And it's minus 1, minus 1 here, right?

39
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:18,300
Any questions about the derivation from the wave equation?

40
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,300
From the wave equation to the system of two equations we are solving here?

41
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,300
No?

42
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,300
Okay.

43
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:37,300
And what are the eigenvalues of that matrix?

44
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:45,300
Of course, I don't expect you to do that mentally.

45
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:49,300
But if you just file MATLAB,

46
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,300
it's minus 1 and 1.

47
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:09,300
So, the eigenvalues of this matrix is minus 1 and 1.

48
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,300
And remember our stability analysis.

49
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:26,300
The lambda k1 would be then equal to our e to the jk delta x minus e to the minus jk delta x

50
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,300
divided by 2 delta x times 1.

51
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:37,300
Lambda k2 would be equal to the same thing times minus 1.

52
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,300
Right?

53
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,300
Okay.

54
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:50,300
And if you write the exponential of complex of purely imaginary numbers into sines and cosines,

55
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:56,300
you're going to find them to be purely imaginary numbers.

56
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:03,300
They go like that all the way to, let me see, this is 1 minus 1 divided by delta x.

57
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:10,300
They go all the way to 1 over delta x times, this is imaginary axis.

58
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,300
This is real axis.

59
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:17,300
And they go also all the way to minus 1 over delta x on the imaginary axis.

60
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:23,300
So, all the eigenvalues of both lambda k1 and lambda k2 lies in that region.

61
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,300
Okay.

62
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,300
So, we need something not forward order.

63
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,300
We need a Rangakala scheme or something else so that we have a stability region

64
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,300
that encompasses the imaginary axis.
