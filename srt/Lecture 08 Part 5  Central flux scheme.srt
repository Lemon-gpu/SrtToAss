1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,080
So the central flux scheme works in the following way. So I'm going to use fi plus 1 to be equal to an average between fi and fi plus 1.

2
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:33,040
Where for each fi is equal to the flux function, which is usually an analytical function or something we know how to compute over the cell average.

3
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:47,200
Okay, so this is something I can use as an example to illustrate how a finite difference scheme works.

4
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,760
So I'm going to write a function.

5
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,060
d dt central.

6
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:51,300
d dt central.

7
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,840
And the input.

8
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:00,620
So let's again, to make it simple, we use OD45.

9
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:05,680
So the time, the input of the function is t and u.

10
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:14,920
So our u is no longer a time, no longer the function at the grid points.

11
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,020
It is these cell averages.

12
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,060
So my u is actually, to make it clear, let's actually.

13
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,240
Give it u bar.

14
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,860
So let's name it u bar.

15
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,900
So du bar dt is the output.

16
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:27,900
Okay.

17
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:32,300
So first of all, we can evaluate the fi's.

18
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:33,280
Right.

19
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,420
So let's say f is equal to.

20
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,260
Let's use the Berger's equation as an example.

21
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,560
u bar square over 2.

22
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,320
That's the Berger's flux.

23
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,100
If you want to change the equation.

24
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,000
To solve another.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,060
equation.

26
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,980
This is the only line of code you have to change.

27
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:57,080
If you want to solve another scalar consideration equation.

28
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,080
The only one.

29
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,080
It's the only line you have to change.

30
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,080
Okay.

31
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,080
So this.

32
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:06,080
Let me call this f bar because they are.

33
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:11,080
Values evaluated over the cell averages.

34
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:19,080
Now the next step is to compute the f at the cell interfaces or at the grid points.

35
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,080
So.

36
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,080
So.

37
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,080
So the f interface.

38
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,080
Is equal to.

39
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,080
What.

40
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,080
We did say.

41
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,080
In between.

42
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,080
Right.

43
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,080
So.

44
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,080
So we.

45
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,080
F bar.

46
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,080
Two to end plus f bar one to end minus one.

47
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,080
We'll just use.

48
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,080
Use that.

49
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,080
So we.

50
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,080
We see.

51
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,080
Obviously.

52
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,080
There is one caveat here is f interface has one less value.

53
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,080
As the number of f bars.

54
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,080
That's the one.

55
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,080
So.

56
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,080
So we.

57
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,080
We see.

58
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,080
Obviously.

59
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,080
There is one.

60
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,080
Caveat here is f interface.

61
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,080
Has one less value.

62
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,080
As the number of f bars.

63
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,080
And.

64
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,080
The number of f bars.

65
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,080
Right.

66
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,080
Now.

67
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,080
We need some kind of boundary condition.

68
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,080
So a simple way to specify the boundary condition is.

69
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,080
To specify the flux.

70
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,080
At the boundaries.

71
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,080
Okay.

72
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,080
So.

73
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,080
We need to talk a little bit about how that specifying flux relate to the character.

74
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,080
We.

75
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,080
Have been talking about.

76
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,080
In this case.

77
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,080
Let's make a easy example.

78
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,080
Let's say the boundary condition is u equal to zero.

79
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,080
Where there is no flux.

80
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,080
All right.

81
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,080
U squared over two.

82
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,080
Is zero.

83
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,080
When u is equal to zero.

84
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,080
So.

85
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,080
To.

86
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,080
Let's.

87
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,080
Avoid.

88
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,080
Discussing about.

89
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,080
How do we.

90
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,080
Adapt.

91
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,080
The flux setting of the boundary condition according to the local u.

92
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,080
Because.

93
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,080
I mean.

94
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,080
We know when.

95
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,080
U is positive.

96
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,080
The characteristics.

97
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,080
Of the.

98
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,080
Boundary.

99
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,080
Condition.

100
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,080
Are.

101
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,080
The same.

102
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,080
As.

103
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,080
U is negative.

104
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,080
The characteristics.

105
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,080
Is going towards the right.

106
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,080
When u is negative.

107
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,080
The characteristics.

108
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,080
Is going towards the left.

109
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,080
So.

110
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,080
You need to do something complicated on the boundary.

111
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,080
But.

112
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,080
Let's.

113
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,080
Just.

114
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,080
Avoid.

115
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,080
That.

116
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,080
By saying.

117
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,080
The flux is equal to zero.

118
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,080
F interface.

119
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,080
Zero.

120
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,080
Okay.

121
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,080
So.

122
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,080
So.

123
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,080
Put the flux.

124
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,080
To be zero.

125
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,080
At.

126
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,080
Both ends.

127
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,080
Now.

128
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,080
The f interface.

129
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,080
Has.

130
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,080
One.

131
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,080
More value.

132
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,080
Than.

133
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,080
The.

134
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,080
Boundary.

135
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,080
So.

136
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,080
So.

137
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,080
So.

138
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,080
That's.

139
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,080
What.

140
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,080
We.

141
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,080
Need.

142
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,080
Because.

143
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,080
Then.

144
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,080
We.

145
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,080
Say.

146
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,080
U.

147
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,080
Bar.

148
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,080
Not.

149
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,080
U.

150
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,080
Bar.

151
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,080
D.

152
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,080
U.

153
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,080
Bar.

154
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,080
D.

155
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,080
T.

156
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,080
Would.

157
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,080
Be.

158
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,080
Equal.

159
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,080
To.

160
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,080

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,080
To.

162
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,080

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,080
Right.

202
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,080
This.

203
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,080
Is.

204
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,080
This.

205
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,080
To.

206
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,080
It.

207
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,080
To.

208
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,080
The.

209
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,080
End.

210
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,080
Of.

211
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,080
The.

212
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,080
Right.

213
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,080
On.

214
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,080
The.

215
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,080
Right.

216
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,080
Hand.

217
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,080
Side.

218
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,080
To.

219
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,080
This.

220
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,980
So for the zero point, why couldn't you take f1?

221
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:57,740
So taking f1 is an appropriate way to specify the boundary condition

222
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:02,800
when the characteristics is going outwards, going out of the domain.

223
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,820
That's actually exactly what I would suggest you to do.

224
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,560
If you detect that u is going outside the domain.

225
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:16,200
But it wouldn't allow you to specify the boundary condition

226
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:22,320
if the characteristics is going into the domain.

227
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:28,320
Actually, if you do that, you are practically setting a zero Newman boundary condition,

228
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:33,380
which means the local derivative of u to x is equal to zero.

229
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:37,600
It basically says that, okay, the characteristics is going into the domain,

230
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,520
but I'm going to just use...

231
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,400
I'm going to use the flux at the first cell, which is actually inside the domain.

232
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:50,440
So this is basically saying my outside the domain is equal to the inside of the domain locally.

233
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,520
So it sets a zero Newman boundary condition.

234
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:59,600
So if that's not what you want, then you need to pick another way.

235
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:05,420
It does, but it's a less accurate scheme

236
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,420
because my boundary condition is u.

237
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,260
So if you add x equal to zero is equal to zero.

238
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:16,980
It's not the average in the first cell is equal to zero, right?

239
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:20,680
So it's so setting doing what you are suggesting is perfectly fine.

240
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,600
Just a less accurate discretization.

241
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:32,320
So what you did here, I'm wondering why doesn't that indicate boundary conditions of flux in and out of the volume being zero?

242
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,780
How you appended the zeros at the beginning and end of the f interface?

243
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:40,880
This is setting.

244
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:46,280
I have a few grid points in the domain zero L.

245
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,680
My u1 lives in here.

246
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,120
My u2 lives in here.

247
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,240
I need a flux over here.

248
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,500
I need a flux over here, but I only compute the flux over the interior.

249
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,420
So I need a flux at this point.

250
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,120
I also need a flux at this point.

251
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:03,280
So what I'm doing is I'm setting the flux here and the flux here to be zero.

252
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,720
So does that mean nothing is entering or exiting?

253
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:14,500
Yeah, no flux is entering or exiting the domain, which is corresponding to a u equal to zero.

254
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:21,040
So I'm basically setting u at this grid point is equal to zero and u at this grid point is equal to zero.

255
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,420
It doesn't sound like you are convinced.

256
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:30,540
So how are we going to model flux into or out of the body?

257
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,740
Isn't that the beginning of the model of that?

258
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:43,940
If the characteristics goes into the domain, I would be setting the flux to f of u.

259
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,720
If the flux is going out of the domain, if the characteristics is going out of the domain,

260
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:54,540
I should be evaluating f of u inside the domain.

261
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,800
Is that what you are asking?

262
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,720
I think so.

263
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,260
Okay.

264
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,420
All right.

265
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:06,260
So I was just trying to avoid having this discussion.

266
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,860
But it's good we have that.

267
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,800
So this is our central scheme for solving the Berger's equation.

268
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:23,700
If you need to change any other approximation, you just need to change this line.

269
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:24,560
All right.

270
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:30,000
All the others, this is exact boundary condition.

271
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:34,660
This is exact integral form of the equation.

272
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,660
The only approximation.

273
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,620
Happens over this line.

274
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:44,220
And the only place you need to change to solve a different equation is this line.

275
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:46,580
All right.

276
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,260
Any other questions about this code?

277
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,180
Finding volume is easy, huh?

278
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,740
Okay.

279
00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:00,220
So to solve it, let's make initial condition.

280
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:05,560
So let's do x is equal to link space of zero.

281
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,740
Zero.

282
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:07,780
One.

283
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:12,540
So let's be sure that it is interface.

284
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,540
So zero, one.

285
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:19,540
And let's do 101 grid points.

286
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,540
That makes 100 volumes.

287
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,540
Right?

288
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,540
Okay.

289
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,540
So u interface.

290
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:31,540
So let's just make it a sinusoidal wave to start with.

291
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:35,540
So x interface multiplied by 2 pi.

292
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,540
All right.

293
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,540
All right.

294
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,540
All right.

295
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:48,040
And I'm using a crude approximation for the cell average of the sine function.

296
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:59,000
I'm just going to say it is going to be equal to u interface 1 to n minus 1 plus u interface

297
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,460
2 to n divided by 2.

298
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,460
Okay.

299
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,460
So that's...

300
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:12,460
And what we're going to do is into the percent, plusvey and even 2 pi plus c.

301
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,460
All right.

302
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:16,460
Once we've applied U to the X 거예요, 0 to n, plusve cure.

303
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,680
And what we're going to do is this.

304
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,120
Well, now our question is, how do we translate the propertyquery?

305
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,120
We write our variable.

306
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,120
We want our direct evaluation as plus e to the X.

307
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,120
What we're looking to do here is test it.

308
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,120
And again, we use min pass to elements.

309
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,620
We're going to

310
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,620
And y as a input.

311
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,620
E as a output.

312
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,620
And there.

313
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,620
So here we have r farming.

314
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,620
And this is a one to one survey of the ??? continua, r farming ziema's, for instance.

315
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,320
And this is used for the unterschied sum and inverse 키 and ...

316
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:31,820
So like this, this is the equation

317
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:32,200
And then now cn first round.

318
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,620
monotonically decreasing region is that

319
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,360
going to be steepening or shallowing?

320
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,140
It's going to be steepening, right? And this

321
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,320
is going to become more shallow and

322
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,160
this is going to become shallower.

323
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,300
Alright, so let's see if that is the

324
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:52,960
case. So let's say u0 is equal to u and

325
00:11:52,960 --> 00:12:01,960
tu is equal to od45, ddT central, 0.

326
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:07,060
Let's solve it for 0.1 seconds and my u0

327
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,420
is my initial condition.

328
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:14,560
Alright, my u is going to be 41 by 100

329
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:21,200
matrix. Let me actually get my u x-bar, so

330
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,940
x at the cell interfaces.

331
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:26,400
Just to make the plotting a

332
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,160
little bit easier. It's equal to x interface

333
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:33,980
1 to n minus 1 plus x interface 2 to the

334
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:38,720
end, divided by 2 and I'll just plot x-bar

335
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,460
and u. Alright, so I'm plotting the

336
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:46,160
evolution of the solution. Initially it's

337
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,640
a sine curve, it's this one, and after

338
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,820
time goes, this becomes steeper

339
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:52,900
still.

340
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:52,920
So I'm going to plot the solution.

341
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:53,940
This is going to be a sine curve, it's

342
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:54,940
going to be a sine curve and the wave

343
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,940
goes steeper and the monotonically

344
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,380
increasing parts become shallower. This

345
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,180
is because when u is positive the wave

346
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,600
goes towards the right, when u is

347
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,620
negative the wave goes towards the left.
