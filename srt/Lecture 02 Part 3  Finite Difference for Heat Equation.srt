1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,500
So we have a function of u, u of x and t at a particular t as a function of x.

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:20,800
We are going to discretize the domain into x0, x1, etc. to xn.

3
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:27,700
So these are a bunch of grid points monotonically increasing.

4
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:42,040
What I'm going to do is I'm going to only remember ui, which is defined as u at a particular xi.

5
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:47,340
And ui is a function of t only, and u is a function of x and t.

6
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:57,420
So now we can see that the time derivative of ui is what?

7
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:05,760
Well, because ui is just a function of t, I should write it as dui dt.

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,720
It's equal to partial u of xi t partial t.

9
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:27,680
Right, so if we can derive dui dt as an algebraic function of ui and probably other ui functions,

10
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,280
we get a system of uis.

11
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,960
We get an ode.

12
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,500
We get a system of odes.

13
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,060
A coupled system of odes.

14
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,780
And that we can solve.

15
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,100
Okay, so let's continue the derivation.

16
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:50,840
By the pde, this is equal to kappa times the second order derivative of u at this xi and t.

17
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,480
So the question is, now what?

18
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,000
How do we approximate this?

19
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,700
How do we write this as a function of ui?

20
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:06,260
Probably ui minus 1, ui plus 1, and et cetera.

21
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:11,420
Right, how do we write this as a function of these u's?

22
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:20,620
So here, the second order derivative has a very nice approximation.

23
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:25,980
This is because a second order derivative is the first order derivative of the function

24
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:26,980
of ui.

25
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,460
So we have the derivative of the first order derivative.

26
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:36,740
And the first order derivative on this function is the slope.

27
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:45,620
And if we discretize this solution on these grid points, remember these circles we saw

28
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,280
on the computer?

29
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,200
We have the slopes.

30
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,260
We don't have the slope on the grid points, but we have the average slope in between the

31
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:56,760
grid points.

32
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:57,980
Right?

33
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:11,160
We basically, we can link any of these two circles, and we get the average slope.

34
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:15,560
And now, this average slope approximates the first order derivative.

35
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:21,980
So taking the difference between the nearest average slopes, we can hope to approximate

36
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,980
the second order derivative.

37
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:24,980
So, we can do this.

38
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:25,980
We can do this.

39
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:26,980
We can do this.

40
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,880
So let's write down the approximation.

41
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:37,200
So the approximation can be written as the difference between the nearest slopes divided

42
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:43,220
by the difference between the location of these nearest slopes.

43
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:51,660
So the nearest slope can be written as ui plus 1 minus ui divided by delta x.

44
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,980
So delta x is the spacing between all the uniform slopes.

45
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:55,980
So delta x is the spacing between all the uniform slopes.

46
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:56,980
So the nearest slope can be written as ui plus 1 minus ui into the point delta x.

47
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:57,980
And then delta x is the spacing between all the uniform grid points.

48
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:58,260
The uniform.

49
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:08,820
In the simplest case for finite difference, we use the uniform grid points.

50
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,360
And this is the slope.

51
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:15,020
Let's say this is the ith grid point.

52
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:23,360
This is the i plus one, and this is the i minus one grid point.

53
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,880
And now what we have written down is, we have the slope.

54
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:24,980
The slope is now 0.

55
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:25,340
And we introduced the slope.

56
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:25,380
We have the slope.

57
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:25,680
We have the slope.

58
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:25,780
We have the slope.

59
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:25,880
And now, this is the slope.

60
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:25,980
And now, we have the slope.

61
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:35,340
this slope and we also need to minus ui minus ui minus 1 divided by delta x. So

62
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:43,660
that's that slope. We divide that by the spacing between these two slopes which

63
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:52,980
is again delta x and we collect the terms. What we get is ui plus 1 plus ui

64
00:04:52,980 --> 00:05:02,360
minus 1 minus 2 times ui divided by delta x squared. That is a standard way

65
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:09,940
to approximate the second order derivative using finite difference. Now

66
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:17,640
with that approximation we get this being left hand side and this being

67
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:22,420
right hand side. That's an ODE we can solve.

68
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:36,400
We get dui dt equal to kappa times ui plus 1 plus ui minus 1 minus 2 ui

69
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:43,320
divided by delta x. And that is true for

70
00:05:52,980 --> 00:06:04,980
i equal to 1 2 3 2n minus 1. And on the two sides we have boundary conditions

71
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:10,720
which we will talk later. The simplest type of boundary condition is u0 which

72
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,480
is u at the left hand side of the domain has to equal to a specific value at the

73
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:20,940
left and un which is the value at the right end of the domain is equal to a

74
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,900
different specific number.

75
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,040
Thank you.
