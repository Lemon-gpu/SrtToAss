1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,920
Approximating second-order derivative with finite difference. So the

2
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:25,040
approximation error we define is basically this minus this. Okay

3
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:35,440
approximation error is ui plus 1 plus ui minus 1 minus 2 ui divided by delta x

4
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:44,500
square minus this. And one of the very powerful way to analyze the accuracy of

5
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:50,040
an approximation scheme is Taylor series.

6
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:04,340
Taylor series expands the solution at a particular point as a function of the

7
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:11,060
values and derivatives of the same function at a different point. So for

8
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:21,780
example ui plus 1 which is defined as the solution u at i times delta x, right?

9
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,020
Because each grid spacing is delta x, the i-th gradient

10
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:34,700
point is at x equal to i times delta x. Oh not i but i plus 1 delta x. So i delta x

11
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:44,160
plus another delta x. It can be expanded using Taylor series assuming the

12
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:54,980
function is smooth analytic. It is equal to k goes from 0 to infinity of

13
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:15,100
u at i delta x of the k-th derivative times delta x to the k-th power and

14
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:25,020
times 1 over k factorial. Right so this is the Taylor series of expanding the

15
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:32,020
solution at a particular point. So we can see that the first term k equals 0 is

16
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:42,100
the 0-th derivative which is u itself. And the second term is the first-order

17
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:47,260
derivative. The third term is the second-order derivative which is what we

18
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:54,260
are trying to approximate. And the third-order derivative etc. is something

19
00:02:54,260 --> 00:03:02,260
also we don't want. So basically in this Taylor series analysis we want to also

20
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:09,260
write down the Taylor series of ui minus 1 and use the coefficients to cancel the

21
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:17,260
0-th term, k equal to 0 term, cancel k equal to 1 term and preserve k equal to 2 term.

22
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:22,340
And make the k equal to 3, 4, etc terms as small as we can. That's the first term.

23
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,340
Thank you.

24
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:34,260
Something we want to do right now. ui minus 1 would be equal to ui delta x minus delta x.

25
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:43,260
It is equal to the same summation, same 1 over k factorial. This is just a copying Taylor series.

26
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:52,260
i delta x except for instead of plus delta x here we get a minus delta x to the k-th power.

27
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,260
Right.

28
00:03:54,260 --> 00:04:00,260
Okay. So now add them up.

29
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:07,260
Let me make another page. What? Okay. Let me make another page for that.

30
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:22,260
Didn't know it does that. Okay. So of course you

31
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,260
can see.

32
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:39,260
Of course ui is just equal to u of k i delta x.

33
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:46,260
All right. Only one term. So let's look at the accuracy of this scheme.

34
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:56,260
So the solution error is 2 over delta x.

35
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:00,260
Let me just copy them down. Not 2.

36
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:12,260
It's 1 over delta x times ui plus 1 plus 1 over delta x times ui minus 1 minus 2 over delta x.

37
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,260
By the way, it's squared.

38
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,260
So it's squared.

39
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:22,260
So the solution error is 1 over delta x times ui and also minus.

40
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:31,260
So this is plus and also minus partial x squared partial x squared.

41
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:42,260
And for each of these terms, we are going to expand the Taylor series.

42
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:46,260
The first term, we look at the first order.

43
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:53,260
Right. So this one is proportional to u of i, which is also u at ix, i delta x.

44
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:56,260
This is ui prime.

45
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,260
This is ui double prime.

46
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,260
ui triple prime.

47
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,260
ui quad prime.

48
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:08,260
So this prime, I use it as shorthand for taking derivatives.

49
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,260
1 prime is first order.

50
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,260
Double prime is second order.

51
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:22,260
For example, if we just expand the second order derivative, we get, of course, 0, 0, minus 1, 0, 0, etc.

52
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,260
Right.

53
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:31,260
So this is, I'm writing down minus partial square u partial x squared as a linear combination of all the derivatives.

54
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:37,260
And this is at xi.

55
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,260
OK.

56
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,260
Another example is when I look at the third term.

57
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:43,260
The third term, which is also very easy.

58
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:48,260
The first coefficient minus 2 over delta x squared.

59
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:53,260
And all the other coefficients are 0.

60
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,260
Right.

61
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,260
And these two terms are a little bit more tricky.

62
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:02,260
So that we need to follow this Taylor series.

63
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:07,260
The first term is 1 over delta x squared.

64
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:15,260
The second term is 1 over delta x squared times the coefficient in the Taylor series, which is k equal to 1.

65
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,260
1 over 1 factorial is 1.

66
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,260
And this is the first order derivative.

67
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,260
And delta x.

68
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:25,260
So delta x is the only thing that comes out.

69
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,260
All right.

70
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:32,260
And then the second order derivative, we still have 1 over delta x squared.

71
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,260
And now 2 factorial is actually 2.

72
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:39,260
So we have delta x squared.

73
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,260
The third term, still 1 over delta x squared.

74
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:48,260
We have delta x to the cubed and 3 factorial.

75
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:54,260
And delta x fourth, 4 factorial.

76
00:07:54,260 --> 00:08:03,260
The minus 1 term, the same, except for when we multiply by delta x, we multiply by minus delta x.

77
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,260
When we multiply by delta x squared, we multiply by minus delta x.

78
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:07,260
When we multiply by delta x squared, we multiply by minus delta x.

79
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,260
When we multiply by delta x squared, we multiply by minus delta x.

80
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,260
Which is the same as delta x squared.

81
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:15,260
And here, delta x cubed, we get a minus sign again.

82
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:20,260
And fourth, we get no minus sign.

83
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:23,260
And this goes on forever.

84
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:27,260
Right?

85
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:33,260
So the cool thing is, when we add them up, what happens?

86
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:37,260
First, let's look at the first term.

87
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:46,260
When we add all the constant terms together, what happens?

88
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,260
Yeah?

89
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,260
They cancel each other.

90
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,260
They cancel each other, we get 0.

91
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,260
Right?

92
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,260
Minus 2, 1, 1.

93
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,260
How about the second?

94
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,260
0.

95
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,260
Right?

96
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,260
So that's a well-constructed scheme.

97
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,260
We are canceling a lot of things.

98
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,260
We are canceling a lot of terms.

99
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:10,260
How about this one?

100
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,260
Also 0.

101
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,260
Right?

102
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,260
This and this cancels.

103
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,260
We have half, half, and minus 1.

104
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,260
0.

105
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,260
All right?

106
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:24,260
So this minus 1 here, coming from here, is the only one that, if you just look at the

107
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,260
scheme alone, that doesn't cancel within itself.

108
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:31,260
It cancels with the term it tries to approximate.

109
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,260
All right?

110
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:36,260
Now if you look at this again, the third derivative term, 0 again.

111
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,260
All right?

112
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,260
It's great.

113
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:43,260
But it can go on forever.

114
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,260
Right?

115
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:48,260
This is the first term that it actually makes a non-zero error.

116
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,260
And look at how small it is.

117
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:56,260
The delta x squared cancels with the fourth, so we get square here.

118
00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:00,260
And at the 1 over 24th, what we get is delta x squared divided by 1 over 24.

119
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:04,260
And this is the first derivative.

120
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:11,260
And the second derivative is delta x squared divided by 12, times the fourth order derivative

121
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,260
of u.

122
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:16,260
This is the leading term of the approximation error.

123
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:22,260
Because all the follow on terms, this term is going to be delta x cubed something.

124
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,260
Maybe it's even 0.

125
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,260
This is delta x fourth something.

126
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,260
All the other terms.

127
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,260
But remember, delta x is a small thing.

128
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:34,260
In our previous example, it's 1 hundredth.

129
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:39,260
That means delta x squared is going to be 10 to the minus 4.

130
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,260
Right?

131
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:45,260
We are dividing by 12, and that makes it 10 to the minus 5.

132
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:51,260
And we multiply it by the fourth order derivative of u, which may or may not be large, depending

133
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:55,260
on what u is.

134
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,260
So this scheme works well.

135
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:01,260
But the approximation error is something small.

136
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:09,260
Something scales, something decays to 0 very fast as delta x goes to 0.

137
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,260
All right.

138
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:17,260
Any questions about this?

139
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:25,260
So this scheme also makes it easy for us to construct approximations.

140
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,260
For example.

141
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:33,260
We derived this particular finite difference scheme from the interpretation of a second

142
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:37,260
order derivative being the first order derivative of slope.

143
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,260
Right?

144
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:46,260
We can also derive it completely algebraically by saying that I want to multiply some unknown

145
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,260
coefficient onto here.

146
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,260
Let's say a.

147
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,260
Some unknown coefficient into here.

148
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,260
Let's say b.

149
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,260
And some unknown coefficient here.

150
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,260
Let's say c.

151
00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:02,260
And I want a times ui plus 1 times b plus b times ui minus 1 plus c times ui minus the

152
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:07,260
second order derivative to be something small.

153
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:12,260
I want the approximation error to be small.

154
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:15,260
Then you can derive some linear equations.

155
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,260
This is going to be a.

156
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,260
This is going to be b.

157
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,260
This is going to be c instead.

158
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:23,260
You want a plus b plus c equal to 0.

159
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,260
Right?

160
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,260
That gives you one equation for three unknowns.

161
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:29,260
The second you want a minus b to also be 0.

162
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:35,260
That gives you another linear equation.

163
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:38,260
Here you want a plus b equal to 1.

164
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:41,260
That gives you another linear equation.

165
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,260
That's three equations for three unknowns.

166
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,260
You solve them.

167
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:49,260
You get exactly the same numbers you're going to get here.

168
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,260
1 over b.

169
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,260
That's the same number.

170
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,260
That's the same number.

171
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,260
You get here.

172
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,260
1 over delta x squared.

173
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,260
1 over delta x squared.

174
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:59,760
And minus 2 over delta x squared.

175
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:07,760
So that also gives you a route to derive finite difference approximations for other operators.

176
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,160
All right.

177
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,260
So you start working on your project today I hope.

178
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:20,920
And the first question require no knowledge of what I'm teaching here.

179
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,260
It's just a calculus.

180
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:28,660
The second you are starting to derive schemes to solve the equations.

181
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:32,660
And I already told you how to do second order derivative.

182
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,960
You're going to be doing first order derivative yourself.

183
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,960
All right.

184
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:42,560
And many of you may already know what is a good approximation for first order derivative.

185
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,160
If you don't, use this to derive it.

186
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,460
All right.

187
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,000
Any questions?
