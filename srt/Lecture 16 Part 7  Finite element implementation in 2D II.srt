1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,200
Another thing is if you sum up A over one of the dimensions, it should be zero everywhere.

2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:25,860
And that's just because if you look at the formula, if you sum up over all the i's,

3
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:45,660
if you sum up over all the i's, over each element, a, k, the sum of the three gradients should be what?

4
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:53,240
So if we have three basis functions that lie on a triangle,

5
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,840
every basis function is one at one of the vertices.

6
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,940
And zero at the other two vertices.

7
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,300
If you sum up these three basis functions, what do you get?

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,220
The sum of the three basis functions should be equal to what at every vertex?

9
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,280
Should be one, right?

10
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,120
So the whole basis function should be one.

11
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:16,000
The whole summation should be one across the whole element.

12
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:21,460
Therefore, the gradient, the summation of the three gradients should be what?

13
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:24,740
Zero, right?

14
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:25,840
Because the summation of the gradients should be one.

15
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,920
The gradients is equal to the gradient of the summation, which is a constant.

16
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,720
So if you sum over the gradients, it should be one.

17
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,700
So therefore, when you sum over each row, you should get exactly zero for the matrix A.

18
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,880
And that also, of course, means the matrix is singular.

19
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,380
We haven't defined boundary conditions yet.

20
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,440
The matrix without the boundary condition is going to be singular.

21
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,060
All right.

22
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,640
So now let's figure out how do we set the boundary condition.

23
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:01,800
So now we have here, remember we figured out all the boundary indices, IB.

24
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:14,520
So let's define a logical array that is true for all the interior points and false for all the boundary points.

25
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:23,300
So let's say, okay, interior is equal to one's number of points, one.

26
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:24,620
Okay.

27
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:33,020
Interior is equal to, okay, so let's say we already have IB, right, being the boundary points.

28
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,300
IB, is it IB here?

29
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,800
IB, yes, is equal to zero.

30
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,300
So interior is going to be one in the interior and zero on the boundary.

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,120
And let's convert it into a logical array.

32
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,980
So that instead of one and zero, it will be true and false.

33
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:55,240
That will allow us to index the matrix with that logical array.

34
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,000
So my A is going to be A interior, interior.

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,180
Interior.

36
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,600
Interior.

37
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,440
Okay.

38
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:20,620
So that will reduce the dimension of the matrix, get rid of the boundary dimension, the boundary grid points that I don't need in the matrix.

39
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,800
So if I run that.

40
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,740
Uh-oh.

41
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,960
IP.

42
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:27,840
Okay.

43
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,080
MP here.

44
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:30,540
Thanks.

45
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,100
Okay.

46
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:33,840
It ran.

47
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,940
And so my A, I think, is going to be, yeah, its dimension is reduced.

48
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:47,060
It's no longer 406.

49
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:52,080
It's reduced by 70, which is exactly the number of boundary grid points.

50
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,840
And now if you plot the side.

51
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,100
So if you plot the side, you get the sum of A.

52
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,620
It won't be zero anymore.

53
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:04,360
It will be occasionally non-zero for.

54
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:19,880
So if you have any basis function that neighbors a boundary grid point, the summation won't be zero anymore.

55
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,480
Okay.

56
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,660
So let's also.

57
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:29,660
So plot the eigenvalues of A just to make sure we get.

58
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:30,600
Yeah.

59
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,820
So the eigenvalues of A, they are positive.

60
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,540
So you shouldn't get anything that is zero.

61
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:37,800
Okay.

62
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,280
That's good.

63
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,860
So we get a positive definite matrix.

64
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,920
Question so far?

65
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,960
Seems like it's working so far.

66
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,840
Now we have the matrix A.

67
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,340
The next step is to figure out the right-hand side.

68
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:55,640
So B.

69
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:59,260
So this is going to be the integral of the whole domain of phi.

70
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:06,020
So we have the integration of phiJ is equal to integral over the whole domain of phiJ times F.

71
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,520
And we set our F is equal to 1 in this case.

72
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:18,560
So it becomes the integral of phiJ dx.

73
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,280
Again, we split that up into into the elements.

74
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,280
It's going to be integration of phiJ at the element k dx.

75
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:33,620
integral is only non-zero in a small number of elements, right, 5 or 6. And on

76
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:40,760
each element, phi j is a piecewise linear function. So on each element, let's say

77
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:45,500
each element is, we have the triangle, the function is like that. So this is

78
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:54,240
phi j, and we have x and y. So phi j is gonna be a linear function. If I draw

79
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,480
the contours, it'll be like that. The integral of phi j over this triangle

80
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:08,240
here is gonna be the volume of this tetrahedral, right. The height of this

81
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,800
tetrahedral is equal to 1, the base is calculated as the area of the triangle.

82
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:21,120
So this is equal to what? The integral, which is the volume of the tetrahedral,

83
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,240
is equal to what?

84
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:35,040
Yes. Yes, 1 third times the base, which is a k times the height, which is 1. Right, so

85
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:42,700
it's a k over 3. Let's code it up here, a k over 3. The right-hand side is gonna be

86
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:53,840
also 0 of m p 1, right, and after I compute the matrix, I compute the right-hand side.

87
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:01,940
So the first is equal to a n divided by 3, with the configuration ofchts to be

88
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:09,180
equal to m r logging over m-1 and the function that an & brings us to .

89
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:17,220
For the value in the batch, we're gonna to meet the length of the bin a-1 and

90
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:21,020
we want to avoid this. So the norm of the gradient space outside is about 1,b-1,

91
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:24,120
and theá»‘i of the potatoes tells us how much it is, so each of them are equal to 1.

92
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:31,060
the three basis functions on that triangle is going to be the same.

93
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,560
So now we have a B, but the dimension of B is still too large.

94
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,400
We need to remove also all the boundary points.

95
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,680
So B is going to be B interior.

96
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,680
Right?

97
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,220
Let's run this.

98
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:51,120
Okay, so that seems to work.

99
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,740
We get an A 336 by 336.

100
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,600
We get a B 336 by 1.

101
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:04,620
So let's also define a U. U would have to be covering...in order to visualize U, U has

102
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,140
to be 0, MP, and 1.

103
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:11,620
But then we're going to set U of interior to be the solution.

104
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:16,420
It's going to be A backslash B. All right?

105
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:20,880
So that gives me the solution, the height of the interior basis functions.

106
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,000
Okay.

107
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,580
So the boundaries are going to be left to be 0.

108
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:31,740
So after this, let's run to see if that works.

109
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,740
Oops.

110
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,740
Zeros.

111
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,520
Okay, that worked.

112
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:46,360
We get a U. We get a U that is a bunch of zeros.

113
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,360
That's probably boundary.

114
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,080
Yeah, we get a bunch of non-zeros.

115
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,880
So let's visualize that.

116
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,940
Let's use the twice serve again.

117
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:02,740
We use the...T should be the same, this should be the same, and we just use U, right?

118
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:07,600
Okay, that's our solution.

119
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:16,500
So this is our boundary, and we are just solving the Poisson's equation with the constant right-hand

120
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,600
side.

121
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,660
Which means the curvature...or the Laplace...

122
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,660
Right.

123
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,660
Right.

124
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:24,220
So the Laplace-ing of the solution should be negative 1.

125
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,220
Right?

126
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:30,200
So it bumps up the curvature in the x-direction plus the curvature in the y-direction should

127
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,840
be equal to minus 1.

128
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:38,060
And that's the solution we get for the two-dimensional Poisson's equation.

129
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,280
And the boundaries are 0.

130
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,280
Okay.

131
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:49,480
So that completes our demo of what...how do we solve the...how do we use finite elements

132
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,480
for...

133
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,400
A two-dimensional problem.

134
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,240
Any questions about the procedure?

135
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,240
Yes?

136
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:03,240
I thought you showed that shape like that's...

137
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,240
Something like 5 or 6 inches.

138
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,240
Mm-hmm.

139
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,040
Why was it not a triangle?

140
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,200
Oh, yeah.

141
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,660
So each triangle is shared by three basis functions.

142
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:19,040
But each basis function doesn't neighbor only three triangles.

143
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,040
Okay.

144
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:29,520
So let me try to draw it.

145
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,700
So we have a triangle here.

146
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,240
We have a triangle here.

147
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,580
And we have a triangle here.

148
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:37,980
For example, we have a triangle here.

149
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:43,140
This basis function, if I draw the contours of that basis function, the basis function

150
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:47,340
looks like that.

151
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,960
The value of the basis function is 1 over here.

152
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,960
It's 0.

153
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,960
So the contours look like that.

154
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,960
So the contours look like that.

155
00:10:51,960 --> 00:11:03,380
I said it's 5 or 6 because the basis function is non-zero in this case in five elements,

156
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,600
five triangles.

157
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,600
Is that the question you were asking?

158
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,900
Okay.

159
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:14,580
And you can imagine I can easily have another basis that is non-zero in six elements.

160
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,580
Right?
