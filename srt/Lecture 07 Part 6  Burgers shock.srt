1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
Let's look at the Burgess equation for example.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,960
Burgess. My speed of the shock would be equal to

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:24,660
ul squared over 2 minus ur squared over 2 ul minus ur.

4
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:34,340
And this only works for the Burgess equation, but if you express the difference in squares

5
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:40,560
in terms of the summation times the difference, right?

6
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:48,240
So, we are going to get a half of ul plus ur, ul minus ur.

7
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:56,820
And ul minus ur, that cancels out. That gives me ul plus ur over 2.

8
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:03,100
So, again, it only works for Burgess equation. Don't generalize this.

9
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:09,840
It's that the speed of the discontinuity is equal to the average between the speed

10
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,940
of the shock and the speed of the shock.

11
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:14,440
So, again, if you look at the characteristics on the left and the speed of the characteristics

12
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,640
on the right, okay?

13
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:28,060
So, for example, again, if you look at here, the merge of the two shocks, you basically

14
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:35,220
get the speed of the shock equal to the average between the characteristics to the left and

15
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,120
the characteristics to the right.

16
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,680
So, the characteristics to the left has a positive.

17
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,720
The speed goes to the right.

18
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,800
The one at the right has a negative speed almost of the same magnitude.

19
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,580
The result?

20
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,120
The discontinuity moving at zero speed, going vertical.

21
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:56,540
All right.

22
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,560
So, why is it curved?

23
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,980
Why does it change slope?

24
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:09,740
Yes?

25
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:09,820
Yes?

26
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,600
Yes.

27
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,880
U and UR can change.

28
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:23,540
For example, when you are at this segment, okay, UL is the same as over here, but UR

29
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,260
has changed.

30
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:31,660
In the lower part of this shock, UR is this value almost equal to zero.

31
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,580
But once you go up to here, UR has changed to this very negative region.

32
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,580
That is why the shock...

33
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:41,940
Suddenly turned.

34
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:49,080
Over here, the slope of the speed of the shock is equal to the average between the speed

35
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,800
on the left and a zero speed.

36
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,180
While here, it is the average between a positive one and a negative one.

37
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,180
That's how it changes speed.

38
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,880
All right.

39
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:06,320
I can also manufacture cases that is...

40
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,520
That have the shock turn continuously.

41
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,520
Okay.

42
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,840
So, how do I do that?

43
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,260
How should I manufacture a case where the shock is going to turn continuously?

44
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,800
Let me do that.

45
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,340
Let me manufacture a shock that...

46
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,760
I get a shock.

47
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,760
Okay.

48
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:35,300
So, this shock should move towards the right because both left and right has positive values.

49
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,640
But let me do something like this.

50
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,640
Okay.

51
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,840
So, I can see the shock is going to turn.

52
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,840
Okay.

53
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,840
And see how the shock is going to turn.

54
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,840
Initially, I'm sure it is going to move towards the right because if you look at the solution

55
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:59,840
on both on the left and right of the shock wave, it is positive, right?

56
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,840
But you can see also these characteristics.

57
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,840
They are less than the positive.

58
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,840
Okay.

59
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:16,380
They are less deep and they are going to run into the shock wave in no time.

60
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:21,980
And as they run into the shock wave, the value immediately at the right of the shock

61
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:25,080
wave is going to change.

62
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,740
It is going to become higher or lower.

63
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,740
Okay.

64
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:33,740
Can you say it again?

65
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,740
The top part is moving right.

66
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,740
Okay.

67
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:42,680
The bottom part is moving towards the left.

68
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,680
Yeah.

69
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,680
I'm just focusing on the discontinuity here.

70
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,680
So, initially, I have this discontinuity that moves towards the right.

71
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:57,680
But as these continuous characteristics run into the shock, the value immediately on the

72
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,680
right of the curve is going to change almost continuously.

73
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,680
I mean, to the right of the shock is going to change almost continuously.

74
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,680
Right.

75
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,680
So, if you zoom in into here.

76
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,680
Okay.

77
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,620
So, you see this one runs into the shock.

78
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,620
Another one runs into the shock.

79
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:18,620
I mean, these characteristics go into the shock everywhere.

80
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:23,620
As things run into the shock, the value at the right side of the shock changes.

81
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,620
It decreases, right?

82
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,620
Originally, this is almost yellow.

83
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,620
Now, it's almost blue.

84
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:35,620
And as the value on the right of the shock changes, the value on the left side of the

85
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,620
shock decreases.

86
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,560
The speed of the shock should decrease.

87
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,560
So, that's why you see this obvious curvature towards the left.

88
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,560
Does it make sense?

89
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:51,560
And now, I don't know what's going to happen because the left side is also starting to

90
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,560
decrease.

91
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,560
So, I think both sides, so both value at the left and value at the right is decreasing.

92
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,560
That makes the whole curve a little bit more difficult.

93
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,560
So, I think both sides, so both value at the left and value at the right is decreasing.

94
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:12,500
That makes the whole shock should curve towards the left pretty fast.

95
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:18,500
I think pretty soon, so right now, the positive side is still a little bit higher than the

96
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,500
negative side.

97
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:24,500
It has a larger magnitude as the negative side, but pretty soon, we'll have a zero speed.

98
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,500
Right now, it's probably have a zero speed now.

99
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,500
It's almost vertical.

100
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:33,500
And the shock is going to turn towards the left as the negative side wins over the positive

101
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,500
side.

102
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,560
All right.

103
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,560
Any questions?

104
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:45,560
So, when we first derive the speed of the shock, how do we know there will be a shock

105
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,560
when the UL and UR doesn't change?

106
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:54,560
I think we assume they don't change value and then calculate the speed of the shock.

107
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,560
Yes.

108
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:02,560
We assumed the left and right doesn't change value over infinitesimal time step.

109
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,560
Right?

110
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,560
Yeah.

111
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,560
And...

112
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,560
So, the question is a very good question is what is...

113
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,560
Why is it appropriate to do that?

114
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:18,560
So, let me stop the MATLAB and going to do some more analysis.

115
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,560
All right.

116
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,560
Right.

117
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,560
So, let's go back to our original derivation.

118
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,560
So, the question is a really good one.

119
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,560
So, why is it appropriate to assume UL and UR doesn't change much over the...

120
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,560
The delta T?

121
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:44,560
The answer is it does change, but the magnitude of influence of that change to what I'm deriving

122
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:52,560
here is at a higher order in terms of DT than what I've written down here.

123
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:59,560
So, imagine UR and UL are also changing in a continuous fashion.

124
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,560
So, UR instead of at this value, it changes.

125
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,560
At this value, it increases to over here.

126
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,560
UL instead of this value, it has maybe decreased to over here.

127
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:22,560
So, the question is what is the contribution to the change of the integral from this part

128
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,560
and this part compared to this original box I was drawing here?

129
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,560
Okay.

130
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:39,560
So, the contribution of this part and this part is on the order of DT times epsilon,

131
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,560
where DT...

132
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:46,560
The reason I said DT is the magnitude of this change is on the order of DT.

133
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,560
And so, the vertical side of this box is on the order of DT.

134
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,560
The horizontal side of the box is on the order of epsilon.

135
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,560
The contribution to this is going to be epsilon times UL.

136
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,560
Okay.

137
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,560
So, this is going to be epsilon times DT over DT, which is epsilon.

138
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:15,560
This is why I chose this interval, A and B, to be a very small interval around the shock.

139
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:26,560
Particularly how small I can choose it is determined by the fact that the shock cannot move outside of the interval.

140
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,560
So, the size of epsilon should also be proportional to DT.

141
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:41,560
That is why the contribution of this changing UL and UR to the difference is on the order of DT squared.

142
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:46,560
And here, to the derivative is on the order of DT.

143
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,560
So, when you choose DT to be small enough, this contribution can be safely ignored.
