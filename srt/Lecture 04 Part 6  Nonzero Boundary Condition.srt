1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
Yeah, the question is, if I have non-zero boundary conditions, what do I do?

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:12,380
So let's just take an exercise and put the same function and make, let's say, the boundary

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,720
condition to be non-zero on one of the sides.

4
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:15,820
Which side do you want?

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,640
X equal to zero side?

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,380
All right.

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,820
So let's first go back to our whiteboard.

8
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:35,260
But if at x equal to zero, which means r equal to zero, the u is something, right?

9
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:47,300
So let's, for example, u of zero j is given and not zero.

10
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:48,320
All right.

11
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,460
How does it affect our equation?

12
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:54,780
So.

13
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:59,120
So it affects our equation only for i equal to one, right?

14
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:00,560
Okay.

15
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,540
Because all the other cases, so we have given solution here.

16
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,480
We have given solution here.

17
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,680
It only is included in the discretization of i equal to one.

18
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:20,900
So we only need to consider changes in the first n y minus one rows of this matrix equation.

19
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,360
And because this is given.

20
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:24,740
Because.

21
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:25,780
Because these numbers are given.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,160
We should actually be moving these numbers to the right-hand side of the equation.

23
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,000
Because it's known.

24
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,980
It's not part of the unknown.

25
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,960
It's not a linear combination of the unknowns.

26
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,600
So moving to the right-hand side of the equation is this term.

27
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,380
Should be moved to here.

28
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:48,740
It's minus of u zero j divided by delta x squared.

29
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:50,740
Okay.

30
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,840
So let's do that.

31
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:54,460
So.

32
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,660
So what I get would be.

33
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,160
Let's use another color to be sure.

34
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,940
What we get is a minus here.

35
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,620
U of.

36
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:13,380
Here is zero one divided by delta x squared.

37
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,720
Minus u of zero two divided by delta x squared.

38
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,680
And minus u of zero and y minus one divided by delta x squared.

39
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,440
That's going to be our bonding condition.

40
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,100
So what kind of u would you like to see here?

41
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,780
So let's say u x zero is equal to.

42
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:36,980
Huh?

43
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,040
One.

44
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,540
Just equal to one.

45
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:39,880
Okay.

46
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:46,100
So it should be ones of n y minus one one.

47
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:46,500
Right.

48
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,240
So that's what we.

49
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,940
That's the length of the vector we have.

50
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,740
So what I should do is my f is equal to f.

51
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,240
Not f.

52
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,180
But f from one to n y minus one.

53
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,260
Should be equal to the existing f.

54
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,700
Minus u x zero divided by dx squared.

55
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:16,900
Right.

56
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,400
So my f is changed only on the first few rows.

57
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:22,880
Of.

58
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,540
Yeah.

59
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:23,940
Right.

60
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,380
So let's do that again.

61
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,880
My big.

62
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,380
No.

63
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,380
My small u.

64
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,640
Is equal to this.

65
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,120
My big u.

66
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,120
Is equal to the ray shaped.

67
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,120
And let's make another figure.

68
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,640
And surf again.

69
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,640
Oh not f.

70
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,380
But u.

71
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:49,120
Wow.

72
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,120
This is weird.

73
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,120
Okay.

74
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,120
But anyway you can see that.

75
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,120
The solution at x.

76
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,120
At x equal to zero.

77
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,120
Let's do the labels again.

78
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,120
x label y label.

79
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,120
Enter.

80
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,120
x equal to zero is now approaching one.

81
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,120
So let's rotate it.

82
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,120
So that like I'm aligned with the.

83
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,120
x axis.

84
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,120
Come on.

85
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,120
It's very hard.

86
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,120
Right click.

87
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,120
X z view.

88
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,120
Right.

89
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,120
X z view.

90
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,120
Okay.

91
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,120
Great.

92
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,120
We can see that if you.

93
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,120
If you extrapolate over here.

94
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,120
We have the solution goes to one.

95
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,120
At the left boundary.

96
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,120
All right.

97
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,120
Also is your question.

98
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,120
Okay.

99
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,120
Very good.

100
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,120
Any other questions.

101
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,120
This is u.

102
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,120
This is my solution u.

103
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,120
With the modified boundary condition.

104
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,120
So boundary condition you can see it has a huge effect on this.

105
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,120
Previously.

106
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,120
This is my solution.

107
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,120
And if I do the same.

108
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,120
X z view.

109
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,120
Right.

110
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,120
So.

111
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,120
I have a solution that of course goes to zero.

112
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,120
As x goes to zero.

113
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,120
And the whole thing is negative.

114
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,120
And on the order of minus point oh three.

115
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,120
And now.

116
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,120
My whole thing is actually positive.

117
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,120
And the has order one.

118
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,120
All right.

119
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,120
Any other questions.

120
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,120
Yes.

121
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,120
I'm going back to your question.

122
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,120
Okay.

123
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,120
So.

124
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,120
So.

125
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,120
So.

126
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,120
So.

127
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,120
So.

128
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,120
So.

129
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,120
So.

130
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,120
So.

131
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,120
So.

132
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,120
So.

133
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,120
So.

134
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,120
So.

135
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,120
I'm going back to your code.

136
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,120
When you were adding the.

137
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,120
The diagonal that's offset by.

138
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,120
m y.

139
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,120
Minus.

140
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,120
One.

141
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,120
Yes.

142
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,120
These two.

143
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,120
Yes.

144
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,120
Right.

145
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,120
Why did you.

146
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,120
Make the ones.

147
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,120
Matrix or vector is.

148
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,120
Size that you did.

149
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,120
The.

150
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,120
N x.

151
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,120
Minus.

152
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,120
Two.

153
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,120
N y.

154
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,120
Minus.

155
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,120
One.

156
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,120
That's a good question.

157
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,120
Let's go back to.

158
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,120
The.

159
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,120
Z.

160
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,120
Z.

161
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,120
Z.

162
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,120
Y.

163
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,120
And x.

164
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,120
Minus.

165
00:05:50,120 --> 00:06:10,220
the matrix. So let's go look at the matrix. So this 1 over delta x squared is what I'm

166
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:19,220
adding, right? So it goes all the way to here. And let's count how many do we have.

167
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:28,040
So in the first block, in every block, we have n1 minus 1 of this 1 over delta x squared.

168
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:36,720
And how many blocks do we have? On the diagonal part, we totally have nx minus 1 blocks. That's

169
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:45,340
on the diagonal blocks. But on this, what we call upper diagonal block, we have one

170
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:49,680
less block than the number of blocks we have on the diagonal.

171
00:06:50,120 --> 00:07:00,780
So that makes nx minus 2 blocks. And each block has n1 minus 1 entries. So the total

172
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:16,780
number of entries is n1 minus 1 times nx minus 2, which is that, right? Does that answer your

173
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,780
question?

174
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,780
Yes.

175
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,780
Okay.

176
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,120
Any other questions?

177
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,220
Yes?

178
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:29,360
Are all figures represented?

179
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,480
We are not plotting the boundary cells exactly, because we are only plotting our unknowns.

180
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:49,920
And the boundary cells also need a solution.

181
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,920
because it's known, it's not part of the unknown.

182
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,920
But on the x-axis, which

183
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,920
up into 1, so should there actually

184
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:04,920
be a gap between where our figure ends and where the 1

185
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,420
ends?

186
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,920
That's a good question.

187
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,920
Yeah, that's actually a good point.

188
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,920
I must have made a mistake here.

189
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,920
So that's my mistake.

190
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,920
dx and dy shouldn't be 1 divided by nx minus 1 and ny minus 1.

191
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,920
It should be just divided by nx and ny.

192
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,920
So let's modify that.

193
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,920
That's a very sharp observation.

194
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,920
dy is equal to 1 over ny.

195
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:40,920
So let's see, where should we repeat?

196
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,920
We should be, let me close all the figures.

197
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,920
Right, so sharp observations like that

198
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,920
is very helpful in debugging your code.

199
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,920
When you see something wrong, you see it in the beginning,

200
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:05,920
as opposed to when you see some complication later on.

201
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,920
So that's very good.

202
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:14,920
I should be doing, constructing the diagonal blocks

203
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,920
and the constructor matrix.

204
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,920
I need to redo them.

205
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,920
And also reconstruct the x and y.

206
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:33,920
And also I want to reconstruct the f and small f.

207
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,920
And now I need to compute the solution u and reshape it.

208
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,920
And then surf and xy label.

209
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,920
All right.

210
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,920
Now let's rotate it.

211
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,920
OK, I need to first click this and right click,

212
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,920
set on to xz view.

213
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,920
And now that's the right plot.

214
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,920
All right, thank you.

215
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,920
And if you want to include the boundaries,

216
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,920
you can add one more row, one more column,

217
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,920
onto both x and y and also u.

218
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,920
And then plot it again.

219
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,920
All right, thanks for debugging that for me.

220
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,920
Any other questions?

221
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,920
Any other vox you found?

222
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,920
So when we have a boundary condition of y and x,

223
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,920
it seems like for some part of the surface

224
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:35,920
is negative.

225
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,920
Oh, OK.

226
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,920
So I think I understand what you mean.

227
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,920
You see in some part of the domain,

228
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,920
it seems to have a negative curvature.

229
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,920
So let's take a look at that also.

230
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,920
So where was that?

231
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,920
OK, so I constructed ux0 f and solve that again

232
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,920
and do that again and do that again.

233
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,920
Wait, this.

234
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,920
Right, so this is what we have.

235
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,920
And you're asking, are you asking this part of the?

236
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,920
Yeah.

237
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:16,920
It looks like it has a negative curvature in this direction.

238
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,920
OK.

239
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,920
So it's a positive curvature in this direction.

240
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,920
Right?

241
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,920
But if you rotate it, it seems to also have a positive curvature

242
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,920
in the x direction.

243
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,920
Right?

244
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,920
So the Laplace thing is actually the curvature in the x direction

245
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,920
plus the curvature in the y direction.

246
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,920
And if you remember in here, when you get x close to 0,

247
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,920
the curvature is sine x times cosine y.

248
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,920
Sine x is almost 0.

249
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,920
So the curvature is almost 0.

250
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,920
That means your x curvature and y curvature is the same.

251
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:51,920
And y curvature is supposed to cancel out each other pretty much.

252
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,920
Right?

253
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,920
So in order for the function to make up

254
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,920
to the boundary condition of 1, it

255
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,920
needs to have a strong x curvature, which

256
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,920
means you need a negative y curvature to compensate.

257
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,920
Sure.

258
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,920
And we have a look at f.

259
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,920
Oh, can you take a look at f again?

260
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,920
Figure of f.

261
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,920
That's f.

262
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,920
At x close to 0, you get almost 0.

263
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,920
Right?

264
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,920
I don't mean f.

265
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,920
I mean the new right-hand side.

266
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:37,920
Oh, the new right-hand side.

267
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,920
It means small f?

268
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,920
Yeah.

269
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,920
Small f is one dimensional.

270
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,920
So I can plot small f.

271
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,920
But it'll be something like that.

272
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,920
So small f for the first block is very, very negative

273
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,920
because of the boundary condition.

274
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,920
Right?

275
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,920
So this part is different from all the rest.

276
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,920
All the rest actually looks pretty much 0 compared to that.

277
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,920
But I'm sure they are not really 0.

278
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,920
They are.

279
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,920
Right.

280
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,920
They are not really 0.

281
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,920
But it has much less magnitude than the first block

282
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,920
due to the boundary condition.

283
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,920
Yeah?

284
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,920
So just to be more general, should we also include the points at the boundary

285
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,920
as unknowns as possible?

286
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,920
So should you include the points at the boundary

287
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,920
if you have more complex boundary conditions,

288
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,920
which makes the boundary points also unknown,

289
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,920
it is appropriate to include the boundary points also as unknowns.

290
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,920
Yeah.

291
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,920
That's right.

292
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,920
So you need to distinguish what is known, what is unknown

293
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,920
in the data.

294
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,920
Yeah.

295
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,920
Yes, yeah, .

296
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,920
That is the main thing.

297
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,920
Uh oh.

298
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,920
dit額

299
00:13:49,920 --> 00:14:00,920
Hello, take the public feedback for the first time after the

300
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:05,920
transcript.

301
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,920
One of the things it oil07

302
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,920
is that guys,

303
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,920
I have this question now which

304
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:19,980
have rows of a matrix that only has a diagonal term, that means I'm setting the

305
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:25,800
value at that point to the corresponding value in the right-hand side. So that is

306
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:31,520
also a potential trick you can use if you find it easier to code.
