1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,880
Then, the interior of that circle?

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,520
Yes, everything interior of that circle is the stability region.

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:08,680
So if, yeah.

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:15,360
If you are exactly on the edge of the circle, then if you look at the error equation,

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,520
the error is going to linearly amplify.

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:26,680
Because whatever error you have previously, you have the same amount of error in your next iteration

7
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,140
plus the additional contribution of the error from the truncation.

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:36,440
So that means the worst-case scenario in the growth of the error is going to be linear,

9
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,060
but it's still going to be unbounded.

10
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:43,860
It's a lot better than the exponential growth you're going to have if you are outside the circle,

11
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,900
but you still can have unbounded growth.

12
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:51,940
While if you are within the circle, then if you look at the error equation,

13
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:56,460
the error without contribution from the truncation error is going to shrink

14
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:56,660
from the exponential growth.

15
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,420
So that's the problem for each time step.

16
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,740
So even with the addition of the truncation error every time step,

17
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,440
your solution error is going to stay bounded.

18
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,080
So the edge of the circle is kind of a boundary, like borderline case.

19
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:19,620
So this x, when we are looking at an ODE, is just a notation for, like, a single variable of time.

20
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,060
It's the solution of the ODE.

21
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,520
So it's not, yeah, so it's not positioned.

22
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,520
Sorry for the confusion.

23
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,780
Potential confusion.

24
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:35,660
So when we are analyzing ODE, we can use x as a dependent variable of t.

25
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:39,980
But when we get to the PDE, x becomes an independent variable.

26
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,920
So that's, yeah, so let's distinguish the ODE case from the PDE analysis.

27
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:47,980
Yes?

28
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,300
And then we can also get k.

29
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:54,480
Oh, also again, in the ODE analysis, we use the k to denote time step.

30
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,460
And when we become...

31
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,240
We go to the PDE case, we can no longer use k to denote time step,

32
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,640
and we use m to denote time step.

33
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:09,020
So let's make this forward ODE analysis separate.

34
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,460
Let's draw a box.

35
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:15,840
This is x of t, not space.

36
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,460
k is the time step, not space.

37
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:24,780
Okay.

38
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:24,860
Okay.

39
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,340
Make sure, like, when we are looking at ODE,

40
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:34,880
the set of notation we can use is a lot different,

41
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:40,380
just because there are so many more variables we have to use in PDEs.

42
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,160
Yeah.

43
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,780
Any other questions?
