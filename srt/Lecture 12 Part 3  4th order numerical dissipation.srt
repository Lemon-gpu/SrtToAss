1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,360
Okay, so if I do this, what do you think is the order of accuracy of my solution

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:18,300
to my system of conservation laws? First order, why is that? Because I add a

3
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:24,300
numerical dissipation that is on the order of Delta X, right? So basically I

4
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:30,240
have modified my equation with a term that is proportional to Delta X. Of

5
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:36,960
course the term is going to go to 0, as my Delta X goes to 0, but at a rate of

6
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:43,300
only Delta X to the power of 1. And that's what makes the truncation error

7
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:50,100
of my scheme to be first order. This guarantees stability, so I have a

8
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,220
stability and that makes my solution error to be also

9
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:54,280
1.

10
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,380
going down at the same rate as my truncation error,

11
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,080
which makes my solution first order.

12
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,020
So we have studied in a scalar conservation law case

13
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:08,100
how to make the scheme more than first order.

14
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,900
We have invented this limiter business

15
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:18,440
that tells me that in smooth regions of the space,

16
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:24,400
we are going to be using a high order scheme

17
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,100
more than first order scheme.

18
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,860
But where I'm close to any discontinuity,

19
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,220
I'm going to switch to a first order scheme like that.

20
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,200
So how do we make that switch in system of conservation laws?

21
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,700
There are multiple methods,

22
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,240
and I'm just going to introduce a method

23
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,020
that is the easiest to implement.

24
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,740
And that's the JST scheme.

25
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,980
So the JST scheme basically switches

26
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,980
between what we just discussed,

27
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,360
a second order derivative,

28
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,140
and a fourth order derivative.

29
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,660
Remember when we did the dissipation

30
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,600
versus dispersion error analysis?

31
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,440
There was a very good question of asking

32
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,420
what is the behavior of a fourth order derivative?

33
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,080
And we did a brief analysis.

34
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,500
The effect of a fourth order derivative

35
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,140
is very similar to a second order derivative.

36
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,400
It's dissipative.

37
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,300
It removes energy from the solution.

38
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:33,940
Right?

39
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,500
And it turns out

40
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,280
a fourth order derivative

41
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,020
is exactly what we are doing

42
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:48,020
in our limiters when we set our phi r.

43
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,440
So we have phi r equal to one.

44
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,440
Why is that the case?

45
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,440
Because if we set our limit to phi r equal to one,

46
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:02,440
we are computing the left and right value

47
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,440
on the interface by extrapolating the solution

48
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,440
from the two adjacent cells to this left value.

49
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,440
And I'm also extrapolating two adjacent cells

50
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,440
on the right hand side to this particular value.

51
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,580
So we can see that the left and right values are the same.

52
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,280
So we can see that the left and right values are the same.

53
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,280
So we can see that the left and right values are the same.

54
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,280
I'm involving one, two, three, four grid points

55
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,280
I'm involving one, two, three, four grid points

56
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,280
I'm involving one, two, three, four grid points

57
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,280
in this calculation.

58
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,280
And when I'm computing the difference

59
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,280
when I have a u left and u right,

60
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,280
when I have a u left and u right,

61
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,280
both from extrapolation,

62
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,280
and then if I use the same amount of

63
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,280
and then if I use the same amount of

64
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,280
the same numerical dissipation

65
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,280
I discussed in the last page,

66
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,220
not using the cell average values,

67
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,220
but using these extrapolated left and right values,

68
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,220
what do I get?

69
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,220
What do I get is

70
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,220
I'm going to get my delta x

71
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:02,220
times the absolute value of df du

72
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:06,220
times u right minus u left

73
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,220
times u right minus u left

74
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,220
over delta x.

75
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,220
I'm just substituting

76
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,220
u i plus one with u right

77
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,220
and u i minus one with u left.

78
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,220
and u i minus one with u left.

79
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,220
In the case we have

80
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,220
phi r equal to zero,

81
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,220
we turn on the limiter.

82
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,220
When we have a local streamer,

83
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,220
remember when r is less than zero,

84
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,220
remember when r is less than zero,

85
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,220
we have different signs of slopes

86
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,220
we have different signs of slopes

87
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,220
on two sides of the interface.

88
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,220
on two sides of the interface.

89
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,220
In which case we want to have

90
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,220
a piecewise constant reconstruction

91
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,220
in order to enforce

92
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,220
total variation diminishing properties.

93
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,220
total variation diminishing properties.

94
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,220
We don't want the reconstructed solution

95
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,220
to overshoot the original solution.

96
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,220
to overshoot the original solution.

97
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,220
In that case, we set phi r equal to zero.

98
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,220
In that case, we set phi r equal to zero.

99
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,220
Which means we want to do a piecewise

100
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,220
constant reconstruction.

101
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,220
In that case, u r is exactly equal to

102
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,220
u i plus one

103
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,220
and u l is exactly equal to u i.

104
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,220
and u l is exactly equal to u i.

105
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,220
When phi r is equal to one,

106
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,220
we know the solution is very smooth locally

107
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,220
and we want to do a second order reconstruction

108
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,220
by extrapolating.

109
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,220
No matter what value phi is,

110
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,220
let's replace phi i plus one

111
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,220
by phi r and phi i with phi l.

112
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,220
by phi r and phi i with phi l.

113
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,220
So this is the formula we get.

114
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,220
And this is equal to

115
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,220
let's just cancel out

116
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,220
this delta axis

117
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,220
u r minus u l

118
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,220
u r minus u l

119
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,220
and

120
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,220
if we allow ourselves

121
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,220
if we allow ourselves

122
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,220
to calculate the extrapolation

123
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,220
to calculate the extrapolation

124
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,220
which is u i

125
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,220
u r is going to be equal to

126
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,220
u i plus one

127
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,220
u i plus one

128
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,220
minus half of delta x

129
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,220
minus half of delta x

130
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,220
times the slope

131
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,220
which is

132
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,220
u i plus two minus u i plus one

133
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,220
which is u i plus two minus u i plus one

134
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,220
over delta x

135
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,220
so this is my u r

136
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,220
my u l is going to be u i plus

137
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,220
delta x over two

138
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,220
times the slope constructed from the left

139
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,220
which is u i minus u i minus one

140
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,220
over delta x

141
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,220
over delta x

142
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,220
and now

143
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,220
if we combine

144
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,220
the terms

145
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,220
the terms

146
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,220
the terms

147
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,220
the term that is multiplied by

148
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,220
u i plus two

149
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,220
is going to be minus half

150
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,220
is going to be minus half

151
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,220
the term that is

152
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,220
applied on u i plus one

153
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,220
is going to be

154
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,220
minus half

155
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,220
so we have

156
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,220
a one here

157
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,220
we have a half here

158
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,220
so it's a

159
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,220
three halves

160
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,220
what is multiplied on

161
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,220
oh we have a minus sign here

162
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,220
we have a minus

163
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,220
what is multiplied on u i

164
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,220
is going to be minus one here

165
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,220
and another minus half here

166
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,220
so we have minus three over two u i

167
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,220
what is applied on u i minus one here

168
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:22,220
right

169
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:26,220
so we have a linear combination of one two three four terms

170
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,220
so we have a linear combination of one two three four terms

171
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,220
so we have a linear combination of one two three four terms

172
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,220
and

173
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,220
if we perform a Taylor series analysis

174
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,220
to figure out what kind of

175
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,220
derivative

176
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,220
what kind of differential operator does this

177
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,220
approximate

178
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,220
what do you think

179
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,220
ok to make it a little bit

180
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,220
clearer let's

181
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,220
let's make it like that

182
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,220
let's perform a

183
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,220
ah

184
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,220
let's perform

185
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,220
a

186
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,220
grouping minus half of

187
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,220
u i plus two

188
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,220
minus two

189
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,220
u i plus one

190
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,220
plus u i

191
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,220
plus half

192
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,220
of u i

193
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,220
plus one

194
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,220
minus two

195
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,220
u i plus u i minus one

196
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,220
so here what I'm doing is

197
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,220
I'm grouping these values in a different way

198
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,220
right

199
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,220
so u i plus two is going to still have minus half

200
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,220
u i is going to have

201
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,220
one plus half

202
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,220
etc all the terms are still preserved

203
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,220
but I'm just combining them differently

204
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,220
now if you look at this

205
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,220
linear combination

206
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,220
what do you think

207
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,220
that a linear combination is

208
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,220
what do you think

209
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,220
that approximates

210
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,220
the d three u by d x cubes

211
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,220
and

212
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,220
this is actually

213
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,220
yeah that's right

214
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,220
so what we are looking at

215
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,220
is

216
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,220
if you divide the first term by delta x square

217
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,220
it is an approximation

218
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,220
to the second order derivative

219
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,220
it's a finite difference operator

220
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,220
for the second order derivative

221
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,220
the second term is also

222
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,220
a derivative

223
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,220
of the second order derivative

224
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,220
so

225
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,220
the second order derivative

226
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,220
multiplied by delta x square

227
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,220
it's a finite difference between two

228
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,220
second order derivatives

229
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,220
which gives us the third derivative

230
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,220
and you are absolutely right

231
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,220
and

232
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,220
it's the third order derivative

233
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,220
multiplied by delta x to what power

234
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,220
cubed

235
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,220
that's right

236
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,220
so it is minus half

237
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,220
times delta x to the cubed

238
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,220
and

239
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,220
d f d u

240
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,220
times the third order

241
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,220
derivative of u

242
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,220
so

243
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,220
so if

244
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,220
this is going to give us

245
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,220
if the additional term on the flux

246
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,220
gives us the third order derivative

247
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,220
what is going to be the effect

248
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,220
on the differential operator

249
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,220
on the difference in the flux

250
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,220
it's going to be a fourth order derivative

251
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,220
it's going to be a fourth order

252
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,220
derivative proportional to d x square

253
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,220
and

254
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,220
it's going to be a fourth order derivative

255
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,220
proportional to d x to the cubed

256
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,220
right

257
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,220
so the effect

258
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,220
of having a

259
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,220
piecewise linear reconstruction

260
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,220
like that

261
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,220
is adding a fourth order derivative

262
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,220
is adding a fourth order

263
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,220
dissipation

264
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,220
to the right hand side of the equation

265
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,220
and the amount of dissipation

266
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,220
is proportional to delta x

267
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,220
to the cubed

268
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,220
okay

269
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,220
yes

270
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,220
oh

271
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,220
okay

272
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,220
so this is

273
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,220
this is the way we are

274
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,220
let me see

275
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,220
so this is the additional term

276
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,220
in the dissipation

277
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,220
right

278
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,220
so this is the additional term

279
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,220
in the flux

280
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,220
our flux is going to be equal to the half

281
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,220
of this

282
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,220
half of in this case

283
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,220
plus

284
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,220
plus

285
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,220
this additional dissipation

286
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,220
term

287
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,220
right

288
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,220
so this is how we are constructing

289
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,220
our flux

290
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,220
now in the system of

291
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,220
equations

292
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,220
instead of upwinding

293
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,220
instead of using upwinding to choose either

294
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,220
f r or f u l

295
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,220
we are adding

296
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,220
we are averaging them and adding

297
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:46,220
the numerical dissipation to achieve the effect of upwinding

298
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,220
and what i've been doing is the

299
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,220
additional dissipative flux

300
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,220
we are adding

301
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,220
and in a finite difference operator

302
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,220
in a finite volume

303
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,220
scheme d u i d t

304
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,220
is going to be equal to

305
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,220
f of i

306
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,220
plus half

307
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,220
minus sign

308
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,220
minus f plus f of i

309
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,220
minus half

310
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,220
right and

311
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,220
so this is going to be equal to

312
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,220
we have a central

313
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:18,220
flux

314
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,220
we are going to reconstruct

315
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,220
so it's going to be equal to

316
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,220
i plus half

317
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,220
central

318
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,220
plus

319
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,220
f of i minus half

320
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,220
central

321
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,220
plus an additional term that is

322
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,220
one over delta x

323
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,220
times

324
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,220
f

325
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,220
r

326
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,220
i plus half

327
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,220
sorry i plus half

328
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,220
dissipation

329
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,220
plus f i minus half

330
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,220
dissipation

331
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,220
so

332
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,220
if the dissipation terms are proportional

333
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,220
to

334
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,220
the third order derivative of x

335
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,220
taking the finite difference of that

336
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,220
is going to give us the fourth order derivative

337
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,220
so we have

338
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,220
the modified equation

339
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,220
for

340
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,220
this particular scheme

341
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,220
for the scheme where we

342
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,220
always choose

343
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,220
a limited value of f of r

344
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,220
equal to one

345
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,220
is adding a fourth order derivative

346
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,220
to the right hand side of the equation

347
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,220
proportional to delta x to the cube
