1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,040
Okay, so now we have the setting. So we have a perfectly well-defined weak form.

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:13,260
We have the bilinear form and the linear functional to be both continuous, and also the bilinear form is coercive.

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:26,560
Now we can look at area estimation of how much does restricting the weak form to a finite dimensional space is going to cause an error in the solution.

4
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:36,520
And there are two types of area estimates, a priori and a posteriori area estimates.

5
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:46,800
They are different in the sense that for a posteriori area estimate, so we always have a v and a vh.

6
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,160
So let's say u and uh, sorry.

7
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,160
So u satisfies...

8
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:14,900
The weak form u and v equal to L of v for all v in h1 or whatever infinite dimensional space, okay?

9
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,900
And uh...

10
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:25,900
Before we say like uh can be represented as a linear combination of a finite dimensional space,

11
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,900
a finite number of bases, that's one thing.

12
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:44,900
But another important thing is that u is only going to satisfy the weak form for a less, a subset of v's for all the vh in xh.

13
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,900
Where xh is a subset of the x.

14
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:54,900
x is infinite dimensional, it's all the possible h1s and xh.

15
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,900
For example, in the periodic table, the x is a subset of the x.

16
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:07,900
So the piecewise linear and continuous representation xh is this piecewise, is all the collection of all these piecewise linear functions.

17
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,900
Right?

18
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,900
So where xh is a subset of x.

19
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:19,900
For example, x is h1.

20
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,900
xh is the collection of piecewise...

21
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,560
linear functions.

22
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,560
Right?

23
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,560
So, so uh is...

24
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,560
It's also the set of piecewise...

25
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,560
It also belongs to the set of piecewise linear functions.

26
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,560
But also, it satisfies exactly the same weak form.

27
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,560
But only for a subset of x's.

28
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,560
For vh's only in these subset of functions.

29
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,560
I think...

30
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,560
Pardon?

31
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,560
Piecewise linear...

32
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,560
Piecewise linear...

33
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,560
Piecewise linear...

34
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,560
Continuous...

35
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,560
Yeah.

36
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,560
Right.

37
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,560
Okay.

38
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,560
So let's start to look at how do we bound the error.

39
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,560
So there are two types of error estimates.

40
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,560
So one type is a...

41
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,560
priority error estimate.

42
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,560
Is to...

43
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:32,560
Is to estimate the difference between u and uh.

44
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:39,560
In a certain norm, usually in the norm of the function space x.

45
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,560
Estimated...

46
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,560
In terms of...

47
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:54,560
The properties of a, the properties of l, and the solution u.

48
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,560
Okay?

49
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,560
So because it's called a priority because we don't know u.

50
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,560
We don't know what u is.

51
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,560
So the error estimate...

52
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,560
Is in some sense not computable.

53
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,560
We can estimate it but like uh...

54
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,560
You can't really compute what the error estimate is.

55
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,560
Because it involves this u.

56
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,560
Which is the exact solution of the weak form.

57
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,560
A posteriori...

58
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,560
A posteriori...

59
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,560
Is better because...

60
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,560
It estimates this as...

61
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,560
In terms of a, l, and uh.

62
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,560
And because uh is something we can compute.

63
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,560
Usually a posteriori error estimate is computable.

64
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,560
Right?

65
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,560
So all the error estimates we did before.

66
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,560
For example, infinite difference.

67
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:58,560
Which type does it belong to?

68
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,560
Let's say we did Taylor series analysis.

69
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:06,560
We figured out the error in our finite difference approximation is...

70
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,560
Something times delta x to the cube times the fourth order derivative of u.

71
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,560
Right?

72
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,560
What type of error estimate is that?

73
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,560
Yes?

74
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,560
A priori.

75
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,560
A priori.

76
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,560
Yes.

77
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,560
Why is that?

78
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,560
Because...

79
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,560
Yes.

80
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,560
Because in Taylor series analysis we're saying...

81
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,560
Okay.

82
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,560
So the error is...

83
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:34,560
A fourth order derivative of u times delta x to the cube times something.

84
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,560
Right?

85
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,560
Like 1 over whatever.

86
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,560
12.

87
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,560
So let's say if the error term is like this.

88
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,560
Plus o delta x to the fourth.

89
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,560
Then it's a priori.

90
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,560
Right?

91
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,560
So...

92
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,560
So...

93
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,560
So...

94
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,560
So...

95
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,560
So?

96
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,560
So...

97
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,560
Because of what?

98
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,560
Because we actually involve the real solution u in the error estimate.

99
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:05,560
A posteriori is a lot more difficult to derive but it's a lot more useful also because we

100
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,560
should be able to compute the error estimate not from the u but from the...

101
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,560
The actual discrete solution.

102
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,560
Alright.

103
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,560
So in this lecture we will start with the easier priority.

104
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,560
Okay?

105
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:25,380
a priority area estimate and if we have time we'll go into a posteriori.
