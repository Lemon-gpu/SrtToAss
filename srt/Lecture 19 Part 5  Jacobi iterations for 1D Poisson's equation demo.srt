1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,580
ok so let's go to MATLAB and figure out

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:13,600
how to implement this. Close all. So what we

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,560
do is let's say we construct a right hand

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:26,220
side. So let's say n is equal to 16 to

5
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:31,140
start with and let's make f equal to 1.

6
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,620
So this is our right hand side

7
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:41,340
for f and let's also make the boundary

8
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,660
conditions to be 0. So u of 0 is equal to

9
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,200
u of n plus 1 is equal to 0. So we don't

10
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,720
have these terms when we are approaching

11
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,800
the boundary.

12
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,940
Okay.

13
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:00,240
And let's make u to be 0s and 1s.

14
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,180
That's our initial guess. Initial guess can

15
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,060
be anything and as long as our Jaccobby

16
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,900
iteration matrix has less than one

17
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,200
eigenvalues, then it doesn't matter what

18
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,820
your initial condition is. You're going to

19
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,260
converge to the right value. If your

20
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,560
initial condition, if your initial guess is

21
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,500
close to the true solution, you're going

22
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,280
to converge a little bit faster but

23
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,800
nevertheless you're going to converge.

24
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,120
So it's pretty commonplace to use a

25
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:33,300
zero initial guess. Now our next

26
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,300
is to, let's actually multiply this thing

27
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,420
to the other side to make our formula a

28
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,180
little bit cleaner. So this is going to be

29
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:47,040
minus delta x squared over 2 times f of i

30
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,280
and this is going to be plus half of ui

31
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,120
plus 1k

32
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:59,220
plus ui minus 1k. Both are half because

33
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:03,180
these are 1 over delta x squared, these are 2 over

34
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,800
delta x squared. Okay. So now we start,

35
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,580
let's perform one iteration. Okay. So

36
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:20,620
uk, uk plus 1 would be equal to the

37
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:25,000
existing, okay so it's going to be delta x,

38
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,860
I haven't completed delta x yet, so

39
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:31,360
let's imagine our domain is 1 and in

40
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,640
final difference we are dividing this

41
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,720
one domain size by n plus 1, right. So

42
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:44,440
uk plus 1 is going to be minus delta x

43
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:53,740
squared divided by 2 times f. Alright so

44
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,980
let's first make this first. So we get a

45
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:02,140
uk plus 1 and then we add this part. So

46
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:06,520
this part is going to be calculated like

47
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:12,500
that. So for i goes from 1 to n. So okay

48
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,200
so I first want to add the i plus 1

49
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,500
part. So if i is less than n, I want to

50
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,440
say uk plus 1 of i plus 1.

51
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:33,420
Okay so i is equal to itself plus u of i

52
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:38,680
plus 1 divided by 2. Okay else if i is

53
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:46,500
greater than 1, you, oh not else, sorry. So

54
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,960
so let's, okay so let's let's initialize

55
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,540
zeros again. So not else if because I, you

56
00:03:53,540 --> 00:04:00,920
if i is in the middle, I both wanted to be added with i plus 1 and i minus 1.

57
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,020
So it should be another if, not else if.

58
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,240
So this is still the same.

59
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,780
This is the same.

60
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:09,800
This is the same.

61
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,580
And then I'll do an end.

62
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,660
Another if is if i is greater than 1.

63
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:23,160
u k p plus 1 i is going to be the same thing.

64
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:28,660
And plus u of i minus 1 divided by 2.

65
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,880
And so that completes our one iteration.

66
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,560
Do we want to look at it?

67
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,220
Okay, let's do that.

68
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,140
u k plus 1.

69
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,180
It's pretty much 0, right?

70
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,520
In fact, I'm concerned it looks exactly the same.

71
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,040
It's 0.

72
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:01,160
So, oh, sorry, I forgot to add this after.

73
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:07,100
So I only did this u i plus 1 and u i minus 1 part.

74
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,600
I forgot to add that part.

75
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:09,780
So, okay.

76
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,120
So I should do it again.

77
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:17,300
u k plus 1 is equal to the f part.

78
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,940
And then I'm going to do the loop.

79
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,420
Okay, so let's look at this again.

80
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:32,360
So, right, I guess it's non-zero, but it's too small for this to show.

81
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,200
Okay, it is non-zero.

82
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,420
So we can see that we have to be patient, right?

83
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,040
One iteration doesn't really do much.

84
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,200
So let's make another 100 iterations.

85
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:49,520
So for k goes from 1 to 100.

86
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,220
So let's first say u is equal to u k.

87
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,540
So we can say u is equal to u k plus 1.

88
00:05:55,540 --> 00:06:01,040
And then we are going to do the for loop over the indices.

89
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:05,040
And end.

90
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:09,040
So that completes 100 iterations.

91
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,040
And it seems to be getting a diverging answer.

92
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,040
Should we have added the f?

93
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,040
Oh, yes, we should have added f.

94
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,540
That's right.

95
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,040
That's right.

96
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,540
That's right.

97
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:22,780
That's right.

98
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,080
That's right.

99
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,080
But why am I diverging here?

100
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,080
Da, da, da, da.

101
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,080
Plus 1, minus 1.

102
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:42,080
Okay, so let's start with u is equal to 0s and 1.

103
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,080
So for k goes from the loop.

104
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,080
So u k p plus 1 is going to be.

105
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,080
Uh.

106
00:06:53,080 --> 00:07:01,080
So this should be equal to f.

107
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,080
Or dx.

108
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,080
Uh.

109
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,080
Right.

110
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:13,080
I think I had one of these sentences before.

111
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,080
Right.

112
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,080
So this is equal to.

113
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,080
Uh.

114
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,080
Minus dx squared divided by 2 times f.

115
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,080
Uh.

116
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,080
Uh.

117
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,080
Divided by 2 times f.

118
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,080
And then I'm going to go through the for loop.

119
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,080
So for i goes from 1 to n.

120
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:38,080
If i is less than k, u is added.

121
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,080
And if it's greater than 1.

122
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,080
So that is good.

123
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,080
Okay.

124
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,080
And at the end, I want to say u is equal to u k plus 1.

125
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,080
Uh.

126
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,080
Minus 1.

127
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,080
Okay.

128
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:58,080
So this time I did 100 loops of the Jacobi iteration.

129
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,080
Let's plot it to see what I get.

130
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:10,080
So this now looks a lot better as the solution to the Poisson's equation.

131
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,080
Right.

132
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,080
Okay.

133
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,080
So just to compare, let's figure out.

134
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,080
Uh.

135
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,080
Let's.

136
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,080
Let's look at the analytical solution.

137
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,080
The true solution.

138
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,080
Let's look at the residual to see how much the residual is.

139
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,080
So the residual would be equal to.

140
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,080
Um.

141
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,080
Would be equal to.

142
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,080
Let me see.

143
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,080
The f.

144
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,080
Minus.

145
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,080
That.

146
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,080
Right.

147
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,080
So the residual would be equal to f.

148
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,080
Let's do that first.

149
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,080
And.

150
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,080
Uh.

151
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,080
We'll fix that.

152
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,080
Um.

153
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,080
Uh.

154
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,080
So the residual is going to be 3.

155
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,080
So the residual would be equal to.

156
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,080
Uh.

157
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,080
Uh.

158
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,080
Uh.

159
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,080
Because we have already had the residual.

160
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,080
Uh.

161
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,080
Well.

162
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,080
Okay.

163
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,080
So just like the derivative of the residual.

164
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,080
We're going to find out.

165
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,080
We're going to find out.

166
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,080
The residual.

167
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,080
If u is equal to.

168
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,080
So.

169
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,080
If u is equal to 1.

170
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,080
R i.

171
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,080
Is going to be ri.

172
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,080
Uh.

173
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,080
Minus.

174
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,080
This.

175
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,080
u of.

176
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,080
I minus 1.

177
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,080
Divided by delta.

178
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,080
X squared.

179
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,080
Okay.

180
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:33,640
all right if I is less than n our eye is going to be our eye divided by minus UI

181
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:41,320
plus 1 divided by Delta x squared and no matter what I is our eye needs to be

182
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:49,060
added with the diagonal term so I'm looking at the right hand side minus the left hand side so

183
00:09:49,060 --> 00:10:04,300
we have a plus 2 times UI divided by Delta x squared so here is my R my R looks like point

184
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:10,720
zero point something so we see that it is not very small yet

185
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:18,640
right so so remember if we have a zero solution U my R would be simply F which

186
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:24,980
is our all ones so after a hundred iterations we see that the residual has

187
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:32,980
reduced from the magnitude of F which is equal to 1 to something like point 2 so

188
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:38,200
it has reduced a lot but not quite yet what does that mean we need to increase

189
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,320
K so let's

190
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:49,360
do another thousand iterations okay and we are going to look up our history for

191
00:10:49,360 --> 00:11:01,780
what we had have done before so from here to here now we have done another

192
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:10,440
thousand iterations let's hold on and the plot the U again

193
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:17,100
so the new one is the red solution now we have seen that the blue solution

194
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:22,780
although it qualitatively approximates the solution it's the magnitude is not

195
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:28,360
that right yet so so the red solution has gone even lower all right so let's

196
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:34,420
figure out what is the residual now so again let's use what we let's try to use

197
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:41,280
our history R is equal to for I goes from 1 to n

198
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:53,140
so the computation of R and it over here all right so with another thousand

199
00:11:53,140 --> 00:12:00,820
iterations we get something much better right so all the other residuals are 10

200
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:10,300
to the minus 9 okay so so that means the red solution should be pretty much the

201
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,300
analytical solution

202
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,680
you shouldn't we shouldn't find a difference between them so let's

203
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,600
confirm that so we are going to construct the matrix now explicitly

204
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:28,840
right so a is going to be minus 2 times identity of n divided by Delta x square

205
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:40,360
AZ equal to a plus diagonal of 1 and minus 1 1 and I'll shift it up to 1 by 1

206
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,300
and then we have the red solution which is the negative integral of the red solution

207
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:48,040
and I'll add another lower diagonal entry so I'm going to say you exact is

208
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:59,760
equal to a backslash F now I'm allowed to use matrix solve oh yes thanks so I

209
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:10,880
will do this and divide by Delta x square okay now I'm supposed to be right

210
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:17,640
okay thanks for her thanks for pointing out the buck so you exact is equal to a

211
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:27,200
backslash F and let's hold on again and plot you exact by let's do diamonds okay

212
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:34,820
and what do we have okay we have it's very hard to see but we have the

213
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:39,860
diamonds overlapping with circles I can see it

214
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,720
okay

215
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:47,000
yeah so so basically we get pretty much the same solution as these Jacobi

216
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:54,060
iteration after a thousand iterations all right any questions on these
