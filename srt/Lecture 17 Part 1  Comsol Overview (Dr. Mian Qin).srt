1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Good morning everyone. So about myself, my name is Mian Qing. I'm a PhD in mechanical engineering from the University of Pennsylvania.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:19,000
That was about six years ago and then I started in Comso as an applications engineer, basically doing technical support.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And then about three years ago I moved over to technical sales. So right now I'm in charge of all the accounts at MIT, Harvard, and the entire Illinois and part of Rhode Island.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So basically the professor of this class, Chi Chi, he said that he'll be traveling for this week, as you know, and he wants to basically, that part of the class may have a project that's based on Comso.

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So he's like, why don't you introduce Comso to the students? So the purpose of today's lesson is basically we talk over how to use Comso.

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
What's the capability of Comso, what are the modules, and also how to build from the very beginning.

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So the first thing that I want to talk about is how to build a building from scratch, how to create the geometry, how to set up the physics, how does the measure work, and then the solver, and then the post-processing.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So I'll try to go into a little bit of depth into each of the building steps, like what are the options, but I won't go into too much detail as to how the solver actually works.

9
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So it'll be a little bit different from what you typically have as part of this lecture.

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So feel free to ask questions, but as I said, raise your hand first.

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So I have on the cover slide a link to the website.

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So I have on the cover slide a link to the website.

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So I have on the cover slide a link to the website.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So that is a place that we host a lot of different application examples that you can basically log in with the username and password that I created for you.

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And then you can launch any of the apps and test it later on.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'll send out the slides later so you're going to have all this information.

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So a couple words about the company.

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So Comso is essentially, the software itself is essentially an equation solver based on finite element methods, at least 95% of it.

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So a couple words about the company.

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So a couple words about the company.

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And then it started in 1986 as a distributor for Mathworks in Stockholm, Sweden.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And then the CEO actually started, he himself is a programmer and an engineer.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And then the CEO actually started, he himself is a programmer and an engineer.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So he actually started something called the PDE solver for Mathworks.

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So that Mathworks is actually still selling in the States.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So that Mathworks is actually still selling in the States.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And then it became a standalone software called SamLab, but it still actually requires Mathlab to run.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And then it was renamed as Comso Multiphysics and it's completely standalone.

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And then it was renamed as Comso Multiphysics and it's completely standalone.

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And right now it's just a little bit of a new solution.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So I have a question.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Does Comso work with media and using sini to run commands?

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Yes, it's fully standalone.

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,120
is actually still selling in the States.

35
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,960
And then it became a standalone software called SamLab,

36
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,480
but it still actually requires MathLab to run.

37
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,620
And then it was renamed as ComSol Multiphysics,

38
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,420
and it's completely standalone.

39
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,640
And right now we have derived many different modules

40
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,460
for different application areas.

41
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:35,520
And so we have about 22 worldwide offices.

42
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,400
I myself am from Burlington, Massachusetts,

43
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,760
not too far from here.

44
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,160
We have a couple of offices on the West Coast

45
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,360
and many distribution networks across the world.

46
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,680
So one of the magazines we brought up is the ComSol News.

47
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,360
We have an annual news magazine, basically a collection

48
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,120
of user success stories.

49
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,220
So those users may be from national labs,

50
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,580
large corporations, or an academic environment.

51
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,440
So some of the interesting stories

52
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,440
you can read about what people use ComSol for.

53
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,800
And just judging the books from the cover,

54
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,680
you see that it's basically different industries

55
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,200
from aerospace, which still relates to 416,

56
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,560
and then also oil and gas, automotive, clean energy,

57
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,160
those things.

58
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,600
We also have another magazine called the Multiphysics

59
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,940
Evolution, which is an insert for the IEEE magazine.

60
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,820
Both magazines are actually available online

61
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,500
on the ComSol main page.

62
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,600
So what can ComSol do?

63
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,680
So you see the different blocks here on the honeycomb,

64
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,040
how they are magnetics, heat transfer, structural mechanics,

65
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,080
fluid flow, chemical.

66
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,080
Those are a few typical categories of problems

67
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,700
people use ComSol for.

68
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,560
And the missing piece here is user-defined equations.

69
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,500
So basically, from each of the existing predefined physics

70
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,880
types, you can choose a set of equations

71
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,320
and start solving for those, which are already

72
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,220
made for you.

73
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,920
All the domain conditions, boundary conditions

74
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,240
are in the predefined way.

75
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,620
But a lot of times, especially in research environment,

76
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,740
people deal with non-standard equations.

77
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:05,500
That's when you can implement your own user-defined equations

78
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,540
in the last column here.

79
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,880
So my colleague, Tammy, is going

80
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,400
to teach on Wednesday about equation-based modeling.

81
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,560
So he'll talk about more on the equation-based modeling.

82
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,000
And then he'll talk about how you can implement

83
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,400
all different types of equations in ComSol.

84
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,600
So stay tuned for that one.

85
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,300
So the beauty of ComSol is in the core,

86
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,320
which is the multi-physics approach.

87
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,440
So basically, you can grab any of the physics

88
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,480
from any of those lattice.

89
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,920
And then you can solve them in either uncoupled way,

90
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,920
one-way coupled way, or a strongly coupled way.

91
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,920
So just a quick view of the product chart.

92
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,540
So you always require the ComSol multi-physics, the long blue bar

93
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,160
on the very top, to run the software, which gives you

94
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,200
the building steps that I mentioned earlier,

95
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,800
the geometry tools, matching tools, solvers,

96
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,560
and post-processing tools, and a few fundamental physics,

97
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,520
such as electric currents, electrostatics, laminar flow,

98
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,780
heat conduction.

99
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,820
And then if you want to have access to more advanced

100
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:06,060
physics types, then we have the last four columns, 20-some boxes.

101
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,900
Those are the physics-based modules.

102
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,280
We divide them into four categories.

103
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,680
So the first one is electrical.

104
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,560
It goes from low frequency to high frequency.

105
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,880
It goes all the way beyond optics.

106
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,440
And you also have plasma physics and plasma chemistry.

107
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,840
And then also semiconductor module and the MAMS module

108
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,400
that deals with very straightforward from the names.

109
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,060
Chart carriers in the semiconductor,

110
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:32,240
how they distribute, where MAMS actuators, sensors, basically

111
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,880
has a unique electromechanics in the thing.

112
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,540
And then the second category is structural category.

113
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:40,380
So you have from the linear materials,

114
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,660
you can use the structural mechanics module.

115
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,840
We have non-linearity, plasticity, hyper-elasticity.

116
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,300
You have a non-linear structural materials module.

117
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,060
Geomechanics module deals with large-scale rock concrete soil.

118
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,280
Fatigue deals with low and high cycle fatigue, thermal fatigue.

119
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,800
Multi-body dynamics allow you to solve many different parts

120
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,120
being assembled together.

121
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,100
Use different joint types in comms and solve

122
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,840
the rigid and flexible body, how the stress and strain

123
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,880
is distributed.

124
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,580
Rotor dynamics is just released a couple of months ago.

125
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,040
So it deals with the vibrational stress.

126
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,700
So it's not just in the vibrational devices.

127
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,860
And then acoustics module deals with acoustics propagation,

128
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,920
basically vibration propagation in solid and also

129
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,800
in fluid domains.

130
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,860
Then we have the fluid category, I guess, for the course 16

131
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:30,160
you're most interested in, which is from the CFD module, which

132
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,840
can simulate from single-phase to multi-phase flows,

133
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,940
to low and high mach number flows,

134
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:40,480
and also isothermal and non-isothermal flows,

135
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,320
all different things.

136
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,160
And of course, many different turbulence models as well.

137
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,360
So there's about 11 different turbulence models

138
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,380
you can choose from.

139
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:53,360
And then if you deal with a mixer, a stir tank mixer,

140
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,540
a baffle, then you can use the mixer module.

141
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,360
Then we also have coarse media flow capability

142
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,300
in the subsurface flow module.

143
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,980
We have low and thin pipes with large aspect ratio.

144
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:07,160
You want to use an approximation of the 1D pipe,

145
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,280
so the pipe flow module.

146
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,740
Microfluidics module deals with mostly electrokinetic flow.

147
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,040
.

148
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,040
And then we have the high mass flow,

149
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,260
and also the multi-phase flows.

150
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,940
Molecular flow is when you have continuum mechanics fails.

151
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,820
And then you deal with high numbers,

152
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,880
verified gas flow in your vacuum system.

153
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,240
Then heat transfer module, which is actually

154
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,180
a versatile, very versatile module that can pretty much

155
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,280
couple with any other physics that

156
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,820
can deal with heat conduction, convection, and also radiation.

157
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:40,080
On top of that, we can deal with heat transfer with phase change,

158
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,740
as well as bioheat.

159
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:45,860
So we can deal with bioheating and cryogenic cooling problems.

160
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,860
Then the last category is chemical.

161
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,860
So you can deal with species transport

162
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,360
in both the diluted sense or concentrated sense,

163
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,360
and also transporting both free space and coarse media.

164
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,860
When you have the actual migration for the charge species,

165
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,740
then we have a few electrochemistry related modules

166
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,240
as well.

167
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,740
So I won't go into too much detail on the fourth branch.

168
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:10,400
And then to the right, in the yellow boxes, or orange boxes,

169
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,580
you have the. how COMSOL works with the third part, which is the yellow box.

170
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:31,320
We have the DCPロ knife, the

171
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,800
cellnit library for production farming in either group

172
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,340
to see why it's effective.

173
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,640
U2 and U3 have the same taką面.

174
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,360
Available in MLS Sid with datum data.

175
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:41,400
.

176
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:41,500
This...!

177
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:41,520
.

178
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:41,560
restaurant fazendo de cardio de установépoque de commentary deträmentar y teaches y'all

179
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:41,580
früllest in on top of things using measuring bags as roku sen later.

180
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:46,380
into mScript and then you can run it entirely from that with just a console server in the

181
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:51,700
background and you can easily add for loops and add different modify any part of the model.

182
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:57,480
You can also draw the console from Excel so you'll be able to synchronize tabularized data

183
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:03,300
and generate reports out of Excel. And then in the green boxes in the middle we have the

184
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:08,480
multi-purpose module which is the optimization which you can define an objective function,

185
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,280
a scalar function, and define what kind of variables can change, what constraints they

186
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:18,620
satisfy, within what ranges, then the console can find the optimum solution for you. Material

187
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:23,460
library is just the database you fetch information from and then the last one is particle tracing.

188
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:29,840
So two common examples is charge particle tracing in electrical magnetic field or trace of particles

189
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:36,020
in blue flow. Alright so any questions on any of the modules? Anything in particular you want to

190
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:36,380
hear about?

191
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:48,860
Okay so with that said I'm going to quickly demonstrate a multi-physics problem how to build

192
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:54,920
in console in the building step where to find the different buttons. So have you received the trial

193
00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:02,860
download yet? Some of you did. If you haven't had a trial yet, email and let me know so I can send

194
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:08,360
you the trial installation. So basically the trial will have every box on this one I think except for

195
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:08,460
the module. So that's it. Thank you.

196
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:17,240
So basically you can explore the package and the mathematical mathematics in physics in the base

197
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:24,740
package. So you can feel free to define your own equations down too. Alright so the workflow in

198
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:29,420
console as I mentioned you start always with the geometry by either importing or sketching in

199
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:34,100
console and then you define the physics. So the physics includes what's the governing equation

200
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:38,360
and what are the boundary conditions. You also assign the material properties to the geometry.

201
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,920
So you can see the different domains or boundaries or even edge and point. And then you match the

202
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:47,420
domain that's what the finite element method does. I guess you already went over the finite element

203
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:53,060
method as part of the lecture. So you know that basically discretize the domain and then solve the

204
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:58,880
equation in each of the smaller elements and assemble them in a system matrix and feed them to

205
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:05,540
the solver. So that's what that does. And then you solve the model. You have the different solver

206
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,240
types in console. There is fully coupled and then segregated solvers. So you can see that the model

207
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,200
you have is the first solver for the multi-physics problem. There is a direct and integrated solvers.

208
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:17,580
And for each of the categories there are many options. And then you will have a solution dataset.

209
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:22,940
You can basically run the post processing upon. And then you can generate colorful images,

210
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:28,760
generate the tabularized data, animations, whatever you want. And then the very last step,

211
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:33,920
step number six, is actually you can create one more step based on the model. You can create it

212
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,180
into an app. So basically you can customize the app interface and deliver that to the console.

213
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,920
to your customer, your colleagues,

214
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,820
who don't have to know every detail

215
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,220
of how you build this model,

216
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,580
but they need to have a few buttons

217
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,660
and a few input fields that they can play with.

218
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,980
So basically, you can customize the model into an app.
