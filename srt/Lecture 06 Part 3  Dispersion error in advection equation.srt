1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
If you do this analysis, it's called modified equation analysis.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:09,320
You derive that, you derive, so instead of deriving a discrete scheme from the differential equation,

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,100
you use the same Taylor series analysis to derive a differential equation from the scheme.

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:21,140
And look at what is the leading term of this modified equation.

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,960
So this is the modified equation.

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:32,640
And what is the leading difference between the modified equation and the original equation?

7
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,860
And in this case, the leading term is a dissipation.

8
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,560
When the leading term is dissipation, you expect to see a lot of dissipation error in the solution.

9
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:52,540
That almost as if you added a dissipation term into the differential equation.

10
00:00:52,960 --> 00:01:01,440
Now, this other term, this term is called dispersion.

11
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,520
It is a third order derivative.

12
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:13,960
In this case, it's almost overshadowed by the dissipation error,

13
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:19,640
because the dissipation error is O delta x, the dispersion error is O delta x squared.

14
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:19,720
Okay.

15
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:22,940
Is there some case?

16
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,280
This is where this is not overshadowed by the dissipation error.

17
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,100
Central difference.

18
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,220
That's right.

19
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:42,840
So to look at the effect of dispersion error, let's, instead of using the upwind difference,

20
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,980
let's use the central difference to solve the same equation.

21
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,880
Central difference is Ui plus 1 minus Ui minus 1 divided by 2 delta x.

22
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,960
So Ui plus 1 is equal to 0.

23
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,460
And again, we do Taylor series analysis.

24
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:16,720
Ui plus 1 is equal to Ui plus delta x U prime plus half delta x squared U double prime plus delta x cubed U triple prime plus O delta x to the fourth.

25
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,680
Ui minus 1 is equal to this minus delta x plus minus.

26
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,580
I mean, this is the same, the same, the same.

27
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,300
Right?

28
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,800
Now we take the difference.

29
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:39,340
Ui plus 1 minus Ui minus 1 divided by delta x is equal to this got canceled.

30
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,200
Oh, 2 delta x.

31
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:45,180
And this is not canceled, but the 2 delta x is canceled.

32
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,860
So this term, we are having a Ui prime.

33
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,640
This is canceled.

34
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,900
This term is not canceled.

35
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,900
It is canceled.

36
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,540
So we have a Ui prime.

37
00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:02,820
And it is divided by 2 delta x, which makes it delta x squared over 6 Ui triple prime.

38
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,800
Plus O, in this case, O delta x cubed.

39
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,300
Don't forget, it is divided by delta x.

40
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:13,720
Yes?

41
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,880
Oh, yeah.

42
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,300
This fourth order is also canceled completely.

43
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:20,800
Yes.

44
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:32,220
So this turns out to be delta x to the fourth because U quad prime is canceled.

45
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,600
That's a good point.

46
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:40,300
Now, if you look at the modified equation, it's partial U partial t.

47
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,500
This is still here.

48
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,020
Plus U partial U partial x.

49
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,380
This is partial U partial x.

50
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:50,520
And now plus U times delta x squared over 6.

51
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,360
So that's actually where this acting in this term is connected.

52
00:03:54,460 --> 00:04:08,900
And what

53
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,720
is that?

54
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,860
So what is this affection?

55
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,820
Let's modify that equation.

56
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,820
Halo.

57
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:43,360
It's this one. Let's copy this thing, paste it here, and call it dudt central. So we still have the same thing, but here it's u2 minus uand divided by 2 delta x, right?

58
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:52,580
And here, instead of 2 to n, we have 2 to n minus 1, because we can't loop all the way to n. We can only loop to n minus 1.

59
00:04:55,140 --> 00:05:06,860
Sorry, and this should be modified to i plus 1, so still to n, but like this is 3. And this is i minus 1, which still starts at 1, but ends at n minus 2.

60
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,860
Again, divide by 2 delta x.

61
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,640
And lastly,

62
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,040
like,

63
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,520
making them aligned.

64
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,980
Lastly, we have

65
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,280
u of

66
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,400
1 minus u of

67
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,880
n minus 1, right?

68
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,660
At very end, u1 is i plus 1

69
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,540
divided by

70
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,960
2 delta x.

71
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,020
Alright,

72
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,820
any bug you find on this?

73
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,580
The name of the function.

74
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,920
Oh, the name of the function, thank you.

75
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,520
Central.

76
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:40,760
Alright.

77
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,760
Alright.

78
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,500
Anything else?

79
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,720
That's it?

80
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:46,560
Okay.

81
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,480
So let's go back to the

82
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:52,360
x equal to

83
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:59,040
n equal to 100 case, because it's easier to see the smaller dispersion error in that case.

84
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:05,640
So let's take u0 to be the same thing, and od45, same thing.

85
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,240
We integrate by one period.

86
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,480
So let's close the previous one and plot.

87
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,760
So let's take u0 first.

88
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:21,640
Okay, so that's still the analytical solution after the wave being advected for any integer period.

89
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,640
Let's hold on.

90
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,640
Hold off.

91
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:33,640
And plot this first using red.

92
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,640
No?

93
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,640
Oh, I still did upwind.

94
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,640
So, sorry.

95
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,040
Okay.

96
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,320
I think it's still the analytical solution.

97
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,320
Should be central.

98
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:53,320
Okay, so let's close this thing, plot u0 first and plot this using red.

99
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,880
I didn't hold on.

100
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,280
Sorry.

101
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,520
Plot this first.

102
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,040
Hold on.

103
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,880
And plot this at red.

104
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,360
Okay.

105
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,200
You see, this is a lot more accurate, right?

106
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,400
So, there is almost no difference.

107
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,800
So, let's advect it for, let's say, 15,000.

108
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:17,960
little bit more time so instead of 2 pi let's do 20 pi all right so we add back

109
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:26,840
the whole thing over 10 periods and now let's take a look now after 10 periods

110
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:36,200
the dispersion error is it's showing its effect so the red one that is close to

111
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:43,720
blue is after one period the one that is away that looks a lot more less a lot less accurate

112
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,680
is after 10 periods so what is the dispersion error doing

113
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,960
it's introducing additional oscillations that's right

114
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,200
and mathematically if you do a fourier series analysis

115
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,200
it

116
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:15,400
is adapting different wave numbers or different frequency of waves at different speeds so the

117
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:21,560
first order derivative and that's all different frequencies at the same speed that is why it

118
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:27,720
preserves the shape of the function and a third order derivative at that different frequencies at

119
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:34,520
different speeds that is why it is creating oscillations this is even more obvious let's say

120
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,960
let's take a different initial

121
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,720
condition so u0 is equal to

122
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:48,520
uh let's take this to be greater than 0.8 so let's see if that works

123
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:58,760
so plot u0 so we get a wave of so so this is the operator that gives me zero or ones

124
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:05,080
right it's okay so basically i get a bunch of one over here and all zeros elsewhere and

125
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:13,480
start going to know if it's a good wave yeah something like this so let's take a look

126
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:25,320
right let's look at the first one okay so Katr's nowPERFOR machine to figure that out

127
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,360
there it is yeah it bulb okay

128
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,080
well actually it Penghuang has a lot of different functional function

129
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,560
entain a sleet

130
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:39,160
of single and double data for T .

131
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:45,200
So let's do U equal to float U .

132
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,120
Is that...

133
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,320
No.

134
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,160
Double.

135
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,940
Okay, that works.

136
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,720
Okay, so now it works.

137
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,300
And let's plot this after one period.

138
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:12,280
So I forgot to hold on, but if you remember what U is, let's hold on and plot X and

139
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,680
U .

140
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:19,060
So U is the blue, and the red is after one period.

141
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:26,280
And now it is plain obvious that even after one period, we get wild oscillations almost

142
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,120
everywhere.

143
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,740
So the very high frequencies in the blue curve gets affected at very different speeds all

144
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,260
over the domain.

145
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:43,420
So that's dispersion error.

146
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:51,600
So when you are looking at a numerical solution, your own solver or other people's solver,

147
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,240
now you should be able to distinguish or spot these kind of errors.

148
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,760
And these kind of errors are for...

149
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:05,940
They are all going to reduce as you refine delta X.

150
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:12,060
But the behavior of them, one is basically smoothing the solution away, and one is creating

151
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:16,020
artificial oscillations that shouldn't be there.

152
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:19,280
Should be plain obvious.

153
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:26,040
And by the way, dissipation error is a lot more difficult to spot than dispersion error,

154
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,400
because it makes the solution smooth.

155
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:27,600
It's just a matter of time.

156
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:27,720
Yeah.

157
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:27,760
Yeah.

158
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,560
I mean...

159
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:28,940
Yeah.

160
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:28,980
Yeah.

161
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:29,080
Yeah.

162
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,560
Who is doing this rookie...

163
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,100
All right.

164
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:30,160
All right.

165
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:30,240
That's good news.

166
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:30,340
All right.

167
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:30,540
Looks nice.

168
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:30,760
Next...

169
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:30,840
Does dumb package actually exist?

170
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,080
I don't know.

171
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,120
Yeah.

172
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,400
So only two languages, you have to find a completely namesake with this idea.

173
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,540
Just creature name and thepa uh, I don't have an idea of what this...

174
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,840
Do you know what I mean by that?

175
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,200
And yeah.

176
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:43,900
