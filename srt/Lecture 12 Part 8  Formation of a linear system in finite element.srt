1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,020
So we have integration from a to b phi j times f minus summation of i goes from 1 to n, a i phi i dx equal to 0.

2
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,680
So let's pull these things out.

3
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:19,400
So the first term is phi j f times dx.

4
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,300
And then the summation can be pulled out of the integral.

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,640
a i's are not a function of x, so it can be pulled out of the integral.

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:35,780
And the integral becomes integration from a to b phi j phi i dx is equal to 0.

7
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,320
Alright.

8
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,660
f is a known function.

9
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:55,640
If we can construct an explicit set of faces, phi 1, phi 2, etc.,

10
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,640
then we can compute this integration.

11
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,640
So we can write the integral for any f.

12
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:14,480
Right, so let's define a vector b that is equal to integration of a to b phi 1 f dx,

13
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:22,480
integration a to b phi 2 f dx, all the way to integration of phi n f dx.

14
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,480
Okay.

15
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,480
Also, if we can construct an explicit form of phi,

16
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,480
we can write the integral for any f.

17
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,480
So integration of phi 1, phi 2, etc.,

18
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,640
we can also define a matrix A.

19
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:43,520
That is the integral of pairwise products of these basis functions.

20
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:50,080
Integration of phi 1, phi 1 dx, integration of phi 1, phi 2 dx,

21
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,200
integration of phi 1, phi n dx.

22
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,680
Da da da.

23
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,480
This is integration of phi n, phi 1 dx, etc.

24
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,320
It's actually integration of phi n, phi n, dx.

25
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:01,260
Right?

26
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,500
So we can get this matrix.

27
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,560
Now, this is a matrix.

28
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,440
This is a vector.

29
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:15,840
This equality becomes a times a equal to b.

30
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,160
Right?

31
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:19,220
Right?

32
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:32,340
So the function approximation within a linear space becomes ax equal to b, which we know how to solve.

33
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,800
The process of finite element actually in general is like that.

34
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:49,140
It is to construct the right-hand side and the matrix by performing integrals of basis functions.

35
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,020
And known functions.

36
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:51,620
Right?

37
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:58,780
So basically, you do integrals either numerically using quadrature or analytically if the function is simply enough.

38
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,700
To construct a matrix and the right-hand side.

39
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,940
We solve the matrix to get linear combination of the basis functions.

40
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:14,320
And the linear combination of the basis functions is going to give us g star that we know is the optimal.

41
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,040
That satisfies all the...

42
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,100
That satisfies this.

43
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,280
Linear equations for any g prime.

44
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,600
G prime we call test function within the linear space.

45
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:30,660
And because of these linear equations comes out of a projection.

46
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:41,480
We know that the g prime we get actually minimizes the distance between g in the space and the particular function f.

47
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:49,140
So in solving differential equations, we are not approximating a particular function.

48
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:56,000
But we still will be able to use the concept of projection to minimize something.

49
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:56,860
Right?

50
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,940
Usually the residual of a differential equation or some other quantities.

51
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:07,180
We minimize a certain quantity that we derive from the differential equation.

52
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,380
And the minimization turns out to be a projection.

53
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,880
Projection turns out to be a system of differential equations.

54
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,120
Using a basis, the system of differential equations turns into a matrix.

55
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,080
We solve the matrix equation.

56
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,160
We get the linear combination coefficients.

57
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:29,940
And by recombining the basis functions, we get to the solution to the differential equation.

58
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,880
That's generally how finite elements work.
