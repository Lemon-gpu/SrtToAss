1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,680
So last lecture we discussed characteristics of systems of conservation laws.

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:15,500
It turns out if we express the system of conservation laws in its primitive forms,

3
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:28,360
we write partial u partial x plus the derivative of the flux to the solution vector u.

4
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,840
So now everything is a vector.

5
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:39,100
So this is partial f partial u is the Jacobian matrix of the flux.

6
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:44,920
Because the flux is a multivariate, multidimensional function.

7
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,520
If we have a system of two conservation laws, there are two u's, there are two f's.

8
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,140
So df du is going to be a two by two matrix.

9
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:55,860
Right.

10
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,200
So we have this matrix.

11
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,180
Dot with the gradient of u.

12
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:12,760
So this is going to be equal to zero.

13
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:24,380
And if we perform eigenvalue analysis of that matrix, we get the characteristic speeds.

14
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,580
And thebeing igual to right.

15
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:38,180
As opposed to scalar conservation laws where- in which there is a single characteristic.

16
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:48,680
In a system of conservation laws, there are multiple characteristics usually corresponding to the dimension or of that matrix.

17
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:56,780
If we draw t in the y axis and x in the x axis in a scalar conservation law,

18
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:05,640
the characteristics determine the slope of the line on which the solutions are constant.

19
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:12,300
But for system of conservation laws, for example, in shallow water equation,

20
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,480
we derived two characteristic lines.

21
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:25,420
And on each characteristic line, a particular linear combination of the solution is preserved.

22
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:31,840
And that particular linear combination actually does not stay constant.

23
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,880
It doesn't stay, the linear combination coefficients of the solution doesn't stay constant.

24
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,760
It only stays constant for linear equations.

25
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:47,580
Whenever we have a nonlinear equation, dF du changes as the solution u changes.

26
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:56,600
Therefore, the characteristic speeds changes and the eigenvectors of the matrix changes as the solution evolves.

27
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:03,300
So along that line, even along that single characteristic line,

28
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:08,200
we no longer have a constant linear combination.

29
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,660
The linear combination itself actually changes.

30
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:19,700
And also, the line, the characteristic lines, at every point, we can compute its speed.

31
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,980
But the speed is no longer going to be staying constant.

32
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,440
Because the solution no longer stays constant.

33
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,780
Right.

34
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:33,100
Only particular linear combination of the solution stays constant for a small range.

35
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,500
And then the linear combination itself changes.

36
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,400
And everything, the solution is going to change.

37
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:46,400
So these characteristics, they, first of all, they are going to overlap each other because there are two characteristics.

38
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,400
Okay.

39
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,880
And also, they may curve even in smooth regions of the space.

40
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,880
And,

41
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:00,780
because the linear combination, they change its value,

42
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:09,780
if you make a small perturbation here, the small perturbation is going to propagate not only according to the characteristic speeds,

43
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:18,780
but also, they are going to influence every solution that is bounded by these two characteristic lines.

44
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:25,780
The region of influence of any small perturbation is going to be like a cone.

45
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,780
Okay.

46
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,780
The region of influence of any small perturbation is going to be like a cone.

47
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,780
Okay.

48
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:42,720
Because this curve, we are going to have to take the

49
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,460
portion that goes from E to 1.

50
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,560
Okay.

51
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,860
So E to 1 is equal to E.

52
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,780
Right.

53
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,240
Because of the Hmmmm.

54
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,780
In this case, this Yeah.

55
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:55,780
Correct.

56
00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:05,600
flow plus and minus square root of gh. What I was drawing corresponds to the

57
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:12,340
situation where the absolute value of u is smaller than square root of gh and the

58
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:17,740
other situation is when the absolute value of u exceeds square root of gh.

59
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:24,460
Then both characteristics are going in one direction. If we make a small

60
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:29,200
perturbation here, the region of influence of the perturbation is going to

61
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:36,580
be a cone like that, which means something interesting. That is, if you

62
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:43,180
look at a spatial point where x is smaller than the location of the

63
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:51,640
perturbation, that spatial point has absolutely no influence by the small

64
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,500
perturbation.

65
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,500
No matter how long you go ahead in time.

66
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:04,420
So this is a supersonic situation where if you fly a supersonic airplane,

67
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:11,380
the region of space ahead of you is never going to feel your

68
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,520
influence.

69
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:18,700
The only influence you have is on the space behind you.

70
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:23,380
That's why you create shock waves. The shock wave is

71
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:29,680
because before the shock wave hits you, the air never feels the presence of the

72
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:37,720
airplane. Only after the shock wave sweeps through that point, the air

73
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:43,420
feels the presence. This is the supersonic situation over here.

74
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:51,160
Alright, so now given these characteristics, we can now draw a new

75
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:51,660
equation.

76
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,220
So we can draw a new equation.

77
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:52,940
So we can draw a new equation.

78
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,440
So we can draw a new equation.

79
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:53,900
So we can draw a new equation.

80
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,400
So we can draw a new equation.

81
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:54,900
So we can draw a new equation.

82
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,400
But as a result, we can now draw a new equation.

83
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:01,940
We now start to study what is the appropriate upwind, what is the appropriate upwinding

84
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:05,260
strategy for a system of conservation laws.

85
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:11,840
In scalar conservation laws, we know very well what is the upwind direction because

86
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,940
there is only one characteristic.

87
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:20,240
And depending on if the characteristic species is positive or negative,

88
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,420
if it's positive, we look towards the left.

89
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,420
If it's negative,

90
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:30,660
we look towards the right. Now we have multiple characteristics and in the

91
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:35,980
supersonic regions we still know what to do, right? We still know what to do

92
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:40,920
because there are other characteristics despite having multiple of them, the r

93
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:47,180
goes towards the same direction. In this case if u is greater than gh we should

94
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:53,260
all upwind towards the left. If minus u is greater than square root of gh we should

95
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:58,620
all upwind towards the right, but in the blue case it is not obvious how to

96
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:03,620
upwind it. It looks like depending on which characteristic are you talking

97
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:10,460
about my upwind direction can either be left or right. How to deal with this

98
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:16,600
situation? One very elegant way to deal with the situation where there are

99
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,160
multiple characteristics is to use the upwind direction. Now the upwind direction is

100
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,960
characteristics going in different directions is something is using

101
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:28,560
something we studied before that is the equivalence of up winding scheme to

102
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:41,320
numerical dissipation right so when we started a linear advection equation and

103
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:50,820
discretizing the spatial operator using upwind is going to give us a equation

104
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:57,360
that is du IDT plus in this case upwind is towards the left so you are minus ui

105
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:04,740
minus 1 over Delta X is equal to 0 the upwind discretization although it is a

106
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:09,080
first-order consistent discretization of the differential equation but it is

107
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,080
actually a more accurate

108
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,160
discretization of the differential equation but it is actually a more

109
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:11,300
accurate

110
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:19,540
I think a third order discretization of a different equation so that's so this

111
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:25,820
is a first order discretization of the original equation but it is a higher

112
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:36,300
order discretization of the equation with some numerical dissipation this is

113
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:41,140
equal to Delta X times partial square u

114
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:47,640
partial square u partial x square and this situation is the same for upwinding

115
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:53,520
in a different direction so if we are looking at the equation that is partial

116
00:09:53,520 --> 00:10:01,780
u partial t plus any let me write C times partial u partial x equal to 0 no

117
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:08,760
matter what the sign of C is the upwinding is going to either give you

118
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,980
this scheme or

119
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:17,980
this is going to give you the upwinding of the differential equation so if C is

120
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:26,360
less than 0 it's going to give me du IDT plus ui plus 1 minus ui over Delta X is

121
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:33,600
equal to 0 but no matter if we have there is a C here no matter if C is

122
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:40,820
greater than 0 which we get the green case or C is less than 0 we get the blue case the upwind

123
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:52,940
is equal to delta x times the absolute value of C times the second derivative

124
00:10:52,940 --> 00:11:01,640
of X of you upwinding no matter left or right is going to introduce a numerical

125
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:06,760
dissipation proportional to the grid size delta x and to the absolute value

126
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,940
of the characteristics characteristic speed

127
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:18,980
so that gives us motivation that if we have multiple characteristics a good way

128
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:24,800
to achieve the same effect of upwinding is by introducing a numerical

129
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:33,380
dissipation that is proportional to Delta X and also that is big enough for

130
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:39,740
the fastest characteristics in the system of equations
