1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Questions about entering PDEs? Is it clear so far? Yes.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So if you wanted an equation with like a fourth order derivative, the weak-sorm level wave option you have is the couple of high order derivatives?

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I will let you think about it. How can you do it?

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let's say you have, how do you solve for example if you have a high order differential equation, say in dynamics?

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I mean you could reduce it down to the system with lower order equations.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Yeah, so before you enter it you have to reduce it to SSL.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Okay, that was a good question.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So for some of these equations where we know people will have higher order equations,

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
in our own we have pre-implemented this.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
For example in structural mechanics for membranes, you have like the biharmonic equation.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And there we have already taken care of this.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:16,000
But the only thing you have to be careful when you are specifying this is the discretization you are using.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Because let's say you have a fourth order derivative.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Let's talk about the second order equation.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So you have a second order equation that let's say in space you have

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:43,000
in 1D, say d squared u over dx squared, but you decided to introduce an auxiliary variable w,

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
such that w is equal to du over dx.

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Then in your equation instead of this,

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
you are going to write dw over dx is going to be whatever originally you had.

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And then you are going to have du over dx is equal to, this is actually not anything.

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
This is u itself.

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Now the question is if you went with this and if you picked a certain interpolation function,

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
for the finite element method you are picking lower order polynomials,

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,000
which locally is lower order polynomials and continuously stitched together to get your global solution.

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
If you picked a second order polynomial for u,

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
then w is going to be a first order polynomial.

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Or if u was twice differentiable, you are only going to expect one time differentiability on this.

28
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
But then when you did this,

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
then you could inadvertently make w and u to be of the same order.

30
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
But in general they are not.

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And that choice of how you pick the order of interpolation,

32
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
especially for mixed problems,

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
is an important topic in finite element analysis.

34
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Beautiful.

35
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Thank you.

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Did you guys discuss inf subconditions or something like that in finite element analysis?

37
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
There are basically existence, uniqueness, stability issues that you might run into numerically

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
when you use a mixed problem.

39
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So you are right in terms of splitting,

40
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
but make sure that you are using the right approximation spaces

41
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
for the new auxiliary variable you introduced.

42
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Yes.

43
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Can you break your...

44
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Can you do that with user defined function?

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yes.

46
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Then when you do that,

47
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
because in the user defined function you define what you are doing,

48
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
how do you call the value from the previous ?

49
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Okay.

50
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So this is when you have a one-way coupled problem, is it?

51
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Or if I write it in the space,

52
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
and see if I can do the equation for it.

53
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So you are saying maybe you have a problem,

54
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:35,000
c1 u, let me ignore other terms,

55
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
is equal to some function f,

56
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
but then I have, I am solving for another equation, let's say,

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:57,000
e, w over e plus e to the minus e to w is equal to some function of u.

58
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So these equations are coupled,

59
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
but they are only one-way coupled, right?

60
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
In that in here you don't have any term containing w,

61
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
but in here you have a term containing u.

62
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So you could...

63
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
First solve just this one of them,

64
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
then next time when you are solving this,

65
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
you want to say I want to use the solution for u in this equation.

66
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Is that what you want to do?

67
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Yes.

68
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Okay.

69
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So if that is what you want to do,

70
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
say in here the first thing is you can add a new equation,

71
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
like a new physics,

72
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
so I can come to physics and then I can say add physics,

73
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
do the same thing of going to mathematics,

74
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
pd, let's say coefficient form,

75
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
this time it's c, I will add that.

76
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Now here it gives the name c2,

77
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
you can change the name.

78
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Let's say the other one is already,

79
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
instead of c let me actually rename it.

80
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Okay, that's u.

81
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And here I want to name this w, right?

82
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
The dependent variable is w.

83
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Now if you come to here in the equation,

84
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
now you have a template in terms of w, right?

85
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Now if you want to enter,

86
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
you have already entered this equation,

87
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
you want to enter this.

88
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
In that template, da is going to be 0,

89
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
da is going to be 1, right, for the w equation.

90
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
c is going to be some value.

91
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
The only thing is I'm going to have this source term,

92
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
which should contain u, right?

93
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And in that, come to the source term here,

94
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
let's say it was u squared, right?

95
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Then just type u squared.

96
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And that's it.

97
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So in console actually this is the way to make your own physics coupling.

98
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
If two physics are coupled,

99
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
the only thing you have to know is

100
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
which term is going to contain

101
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
something in terms of the other,

102
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
and just type that in.

103
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And now the catch is,

104
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
here in the solver,

105
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
it's going to want to solve both of them together.

106
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And that is, we do this for the sake of robustness.

107
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Because possibly there is a two-way coupling,

108
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
and you need to solve it together.

109
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
But now you, as an analyst,

110
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
know from your equations that there is only a one-way coupling.

111
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Then that one-way coupling, you can enforce it.

112
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And the way to enforce it is,

113
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
here in the study,

114
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
in the step, add a new study.

115
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Let's say I add a new step.

116
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So now I have two steps.

117
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
But then in the first step,

118
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I just need to solve for that one.

119
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And in the second one,

120
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I need to keep only that one.

121
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So now what it will do is it will solve the first physics.

122
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And then there is a trickle-down mechanism.

123
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
So you have to order these choices.

124
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And then you have to do it appropriately

125
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
so that the first one doesn't need data from any other equation.

126
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And then in the second one, you can just use it.

127
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So the principle is that it comes from any place

128
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
where you could have typed a number,

129
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
you could type a function,

130
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
you could type an expression of another null.

131
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And that is how you actually make custom coupling.

132
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Does that address your question?

133
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Other questions?

134
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Yes?

135
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You don't have to make sure that for that second study

136
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
that it's dependent on the first study.

137
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It will just already know that.

138
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Yeah.

139
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
But sometimes that may not be the case.

140
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
In this case, if you put them under the same study,

141
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
it will just know that to get them from above.

142
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
But sometimes,

143
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
but then if I'm solving this,

144
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm solving both of them together.

145
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Right?

146
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So sometimes you might be in a situation where

147
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
you solved the first problem,

148
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
and you know you're not going to change it.

149
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And you just now want to quit your second equation.

150
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So you don't want to be solving both of them together in two sets,

151
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
because the first one is dead.

152
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You don't want to deal with it, right?

153
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
In a situation like that,

154
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
instead of adding a new step,

155
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
let me delete this,

156
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
add a completely new study.

157
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And let me add a new study.

158
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Add study stationary.

159
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
See the difference?

160
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Earlier I had two steps within the same study.

161
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
But now I have completely different studies.

162
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Here it doesn't know.

163
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It doesn't know where to get it from.

164
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Now in that case,

165
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
let's say I only keep this.

166
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You see these values of dependent variables?

167
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
If I expand that section,

168
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
there is values of dependent variables solved for,

169
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
and values of dependent variables not solved for.

170
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Now at this point,

171
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
the solution from above is something I'm not solving for anymore.

172
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I will just be using it as a parameter.

173
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
So here you come and say you are user controlled.

174
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You're getting it from a solution from the first solution.

175
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So now you are indicating yourself.

176
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Is that the answer?

177
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Other questions?

178
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So now let's move on to the other topics.

179
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Ordinary differential equations and differential algebraic equations.

180
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
ComSol doesn't make a distinction between ordinary differential equations and differential algebraic equations.

181
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It doesn't see any derivative in any of the equations.

182
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It just deals with it as an algebraic equation.

183
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And it's a derivative that deals with it as a differential equation.

184
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Now, when we mean what it is,

185
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I want to make it really clear that we actually just mean initial value problems.

186
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
So if you compare those two equations,

187
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
they are really the same, right?

188
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
The first one is in time.

189
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
The second one is in space.

190
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Strictly speaking, mathematically, right,

191
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
they are both ordinary differential equations.

192
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
But in numerical analysis, they are treated differently, right?

193
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
For example, if you were using the finite element method,

194
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
the special derivatives, you're going to,

195
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
the special one, you're going to take care of it by the finite element shape function.

196
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Whereas for the time derivative,

197
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
you're going to have a time integration scheme,

198
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
something like a backward Euler,

199
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
a time order version of that.

200
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
So space and time are dealt with differently.

201
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
And because of that,

202
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
when we mean initial value problems,

203
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
or when we mean all E's,

204
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
we just mean initial value problems,

205
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
where there is no special derivative.

206
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
If there is any special derivative,

207
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
even if you don't have time derivatives,

208
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
you have to use the PDE integration.

209
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Is that distinction clear?

210
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
So you also need,

211
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
for example, if you're solving the first equation,

212
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
the first equation is mostly like a particle dynamics equation,

213
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
where you would want to specify both the initial location and the initial velocity.

214
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Whereas the second one is more or less like an equilibrium problem in 1D,

215
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
where you want to specify boundary conditions at the two ends.

216
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
So that is like a two point boundary value problem,

217
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
whereas the other one is an initial value problem

218
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
where you specify two initial conditions at one point.

219
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
So they are different.

220
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
So when we mean all E's,

221
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
in the context of console,

222
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
we mean initial value problems.

223
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
So between initial value problems and algebraic problems,

224
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
there is no distinction.

225
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You can also have differential algebraic equations, right?

226
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
You can have ordinary differential equations

227
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
between which there is an algebraic constraint.

228
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
And this can be global or lumped.

229
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
What I mean by global is,

230
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
you have just one equation.

231
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Whereas, I mean global or domain or distributed.

232
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
What I mean by domain is,

233
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
when you can have equations,

234
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
different ODE's every different place.

235
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
That will become clearer when I get to an example.
