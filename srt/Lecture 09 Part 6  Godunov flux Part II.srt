1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
f has a negative slope.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,340
Oh, yeah, it's a minimum.

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:04,760
Sorry.

4
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,140
It's a minimum.

5
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,380
Right, so because df du is negative,

6
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:17,320
so it has a negative slope at the left

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,560
and a positive slope on the right.

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,120
So these are corresponding to u u f.

9
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:27,280
Right.

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,960
Any questions about this?

11
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:35,780
So if the characteristic of u changes sign,

12
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,900
which means, in this case,

13
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:44,720
f has a local minimum in the range of ul and ur,

14
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,500
then I need to choose that minimum as my flux.

15
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,580
Neither f of left nor f of right.

16
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,240
Well, if f is monotonically increasing or decreasing,

17
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,980
then, yeah, that would never happen.

18
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:05,060
Right, so for example, for linear action equation

19
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:09,880
where f is just proportional to u,

20
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,140
you don't need to use this.

21
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,220
You can just do upwinding or, yeah.

22
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:23,860
So, OK, so let's say this formula is also

23
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:27,280
applicable to all the cases where u r

24
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:27,560
is just a linear action equation.

25
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:27,780
Right.

26
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:28,980
So, OK, so let's say this formula is also applicable to all the cases where u r is,

27
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:29,020
is, is, is, is non-negotiable.

28
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:29,540
Right.

29
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,740
is greater than ul.

30
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:36,520
So for example, in this case, the entire short wave

31
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:57,680
propagates towards the left, which means f of ur

32
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,920
minus f of ul divided by bur minus ul is less than 0.

33
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:21,280
So this means f has a negative slope in this range.

34
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,300
And taking c.

35
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:27,680
It's c.

36
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,260
And the ur minus ul is.

37
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,640
So taking the minimum would be taking.

38
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,300
So the denominator is greater than 0,

39
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,040
which means the numerator is less than 0.

40
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:53,220
And that means ul is greater than ur, right?

41
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,440
Ul is greater than ur.

42
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:56,920
So.

43
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,680
Taking the minimum over that range, what would I get?

44
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,860
I would get ur, right?

45
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,840
So whenever ur is greater than ul,

46
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,560
I want to take the minimum of the flux over this range.

47
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,420
And the other case is also is the opposite.

48
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:26,460
So when ur is less than ul, I should be taking the maximum over this range.

49
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,440
So for example, that would never happen in.

50
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,520
So this kind of reverse scenario would never happen in Berger's equation.

51
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,980
But you can think of if the flux is minus of u squared over 2

52
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:44,760
instead of positive u squared over 2, then the scenario would happen.

53
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:52,500
So the kind of shock wave would diffuse into expansion

54
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,420
after infinitesimal amount of time.

55
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,560
So the solution would be.

56
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,600
The solution would go towards the left on the left side.

57
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,240
The solution would go towards the right on the right side.

58
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:03,400
Then.

59
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,320
So this is the case where ur is less than ul.

60
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:17,420
And in this case, the derivative of f to u at ur,

61
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:22,340
which is higher, is positive.

62
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,320
So at u.

63
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,680
So at ul.

64
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:26,920
At u.

65
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,160
At u.

66
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,460
At u.

67
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:27,520
At u.

68
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,460
At ur is positive, sorry.

69
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,140
So let me draw.

70
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,260
Let me draw.

71
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,900
Let me actually draw this case in the next page.

72
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:42,920
So we have a discontinuity that evolves into an expansion.

73
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,360
We have ul greater than ur.

74
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,140
And ur is over here.

75
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,760
So my df.

76
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,400
Now,

77
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:57,440
dt.

78
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:57,480
dt.

79
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:57,540
dt.

80
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:08,120
u over the range of u r which is less than u l is going to be like that so u r is positive

81
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:16,120
the the uh the solution u r goes towards the right which means the characteristics is positive over

82
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,080
here and this negative over here so the characteristics is going to going to cross

83
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:29,880
zero over here which means on the function value of f we have a positive slope

84
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,780
and then the negative slope and this point

85
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:42,600
is the local arg max of f

86
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:50,760
and at that point the characteristics has zero speed which exactly corresponds

87
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:57,720
to the value where you should be evaluating the flux after infinitesimal amount of time

88
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:12,600
so this case arg max of f u is greater than u r greater than less than u l is what should be

89
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:19,880
choosing here so in in summary the flux at i plus half

90
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:31,080
let's just say godunov scheme is equal to two cases one is equal to the maximum

91
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,280
of f over

92
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,800
over a region

93
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:49,080
u r less than u less than u l if

94
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,800
u l is greater than u r

95
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:04,040
so left in this case is i r in this case is i plus one i should say that

96
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:10,200
left is i right is i plus one

97
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:20,360
and other case is the minimum of f over u i less than u less than u i plus one

98
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:30,680
if u r is less than u r plus 1 and of course if u r is equal to us plus 1 F is just f of that u

99
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:39,800
so this method is looking at a discontinuous solution at the interface evolve that solution

100
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:46,760
analytically for absolute amount of time and look at what is the flux i should be using after that

101
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,740
absolute amount of time all right this was all theFT regularly assume you're interested in my famous

102
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:59,920
Alright, and there is an analytical formula for that flux over here.

103
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:09,360
So this is a very elegant result, and unfortunately this only works for a scalar conservation

104
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,680
law.

105
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:16,720
So for a system of conservation laws, the same argument actually applies.

106
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:23,920
So you can look at this continuous interface, solve that equation for epsilon amount of

107
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,580
time and look at what flux you should be using there.

108
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:33,660
But then we no longer have this very elegant formula.

109
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,520
It becomes an equation-dependent problem.

110
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:42,440
And there were entire PhDs that worked out for a particular system of equations what

111
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,600
is the correct flux to use over here.

112
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,600
Well,

113
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:51,900
there is also different ways to approximate, not exactly solve this problem of evolving

114
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,600
for epsilon amount of time and computing the flux.

115
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,900
There are also many methods developed to approximate that.

116
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:04,480
But for scalar conservation laws, this is a very nice formula we can use.
