1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,140
But let's say I want to solve this algebraic equation, just finding roots, right?

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,960
I want to solve u cubed is equal to 8 for u.

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,680
Now the template is f of everything is 0.

4
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,600
So then you have to write it in this template, right?

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:24,320
Then what you will do is you specifically write u cubed minus 8, because that is going to be 0.

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,380
And then you put your initial value.

7
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,200
So let's see how to solve this.

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:37,440
File, new, model wizard.

9
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,360
This is going to be a 0D problem.

10
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,500
There is no special variation to it.

11
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,880
I come to this, global ODAs and DAEs.

12
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,460
I add this.

13
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,700
I'm going to solve a stationary problem.

14
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,040
I'm done.

15
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,860
Now, here I write I'm going to solve for u.

16
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,120
And the equation is I'm not going to say u cubed is equal to 8.

17
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:06,820
I have to write whatever it is needs to be set to 0.

18
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,740
So now u cubed minus 8.

19
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,580
And what's the initial value?

20
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,860
Well, for a stationary problem, that's meaningless.

21
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,540
For time dependent problem, I mean, for time dependent problem, it's meaningful.

22
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,220
But for a stationary problem, it's only a numerical item.

23
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:26,940
Let me compute this.

24
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,240
This is a reasonably simple problem, right?

25
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,280
We even know the solution.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,080
But it's saying, we have to find a solution.

27
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,240
What do you think is going on?

28
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:42,400
Huh?

29
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:44,440
Anybody?

30
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:52,440
Let's think in terms of just real, whatever.

31
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:52,580
Yeah.

32
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:56,080
If we talk, if we assume it's going to be a real solution.

33
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,580
Let me show you the equation.

34
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:57,820
Okay.

35
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:57,920
Okay.

36
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:57,980
Okay.

37
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:58,080
Okay.

38
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,180
Okay.

39
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:58,280
Okay.

40
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,180
I was solving it anyway.

41
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:01,800
Here.

42
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,380
Okay.

43
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:07,180
Okay.

44
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:07,680
Any suggestions?

45
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:08,360
Yes?

46
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,060
Okay.

47
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:18,460
Okay.

48
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:22,380
Okay.

49
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,320
Okay.

50
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:25,500
Okay.

51
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,800
Okay.

52
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,080
Okay.

53
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,160
Okay.

54
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,200
Okay.

55
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,200
to change the integral value.

56
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,200
Yeah.

57
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,200
You're the new expression in the class.

58
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,200
So anyway, let's assume we are solving this using the Newton

59
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,200
method, right?

60
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,200
If we are solving this with the Newton method,

61
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,200
we're trying to form f of u is equal to 0 for u.

62
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,200
We don't know how to approach this,

63
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,200
but we can always state it, right?

64
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:59,200
This is actually a question I always ask myself.

65
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,200
When I run into a new numerical problem that I don't know how

66
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,200
to deal with, you ask yourself, what would Taylor do?

67
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,200
Once I Google, what would Taylor do?

68
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,200
And there are and one piece for what would Taylor do?

69
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,200
But it's for Taylor Swift.

70
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,200
That is a point that I know there would be for .

71
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,200
But anyway, so the way you do it, you

72
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,200
are trying to find.

73
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,200
You are trying to find a distance, a displacement that

74
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,200
will take you closer to your solution.

75
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:31,200
And if you put the Taylor expansion of this,

76
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,200
then you are going to have f prime of u delta u.

77
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,200
And we ignore the I-order terms.

78
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,200
So now if you set this to be 0 in a one-dimensional case,

79
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,200
I mean in a scalar problem, what you're getting

80
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:51,200
is the distance you need to move on is going to be f of u

81
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,200
over mu.

82
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,200
So you're going to have f prime of u negative.

83
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:01,200
And if f prime is 0, or if this is a scalar,

84
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,200
your vector system of equations you are solving,

85
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,200
f minus f, which is the residual, is going

86
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,200
to be your Jacobian matrix like this.

87
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,200
And if this is singular, you're going to run into a problem.

88
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,200
And here we are solving u cubed minus 8.

89
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,200
What is the root?

90
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,200
The derivative.

91
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,200
3u squared.

92
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,200
Check it out.

93
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,200
It's 0.

94
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,200
So that's what we are getting here.

95
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:32,200
So let's change the initial value and recompute.

96
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:37,200
And our solution here, if I evaluate, it's 2.

97
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,200
So that was the problem with the initial starting point.

98
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,200
So all these ideas that you keep talking

99
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,200
in your numerical analysis classes, they have consequences.

100
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:56,200
And a lot of times when we have people difficulty using the software,

101
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:00,200
it's because you miss things like this.

102
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,200
And then we'll be like, hey, why isn't this working?

103
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,200
This is really a simple problem.

104
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:11,200
And you guys cannot solve this and pay me back.

105
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:16,200
Anyway, moving on.

106
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,200
Since Comsol doesn't distinguish in this interval,

107
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:24,200
you don't have different interfaces for algebraic and global equations.

108
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:30,200
So before I actually go to differential equations,

109
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,200
I want to talk a little bit about domain algebraic equations.

110
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,200
What we solve now is a global algebraic equation.

111
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,200
But let's say we want to solve a problem.

112
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,200
Instead of u cubed being equal to 8,

113
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:45,200
you want to solve u cubed is equal to some function of location.

114
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,200
So what is going to happen?

115
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,200
Every point is going to have its own solution.

116
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,200
At every point, the problem is algebraic.

117
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:58,200
But it is going to have different parameters.

118
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,200
So in any problem like this,

119
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,200
you're going to have an algebraic field equation.

120
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:08,200
For example, when you are solving sometimes multiphysics problems,

121
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,200
there will be some kind of dynamic constraints

122
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,200
between different variables, some algebraic constraints.

123
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,200
And sometimes you know that directly, one in terms of the other.

124
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:25,200
So you have, let's say maybe you know p is some function of temperature

125
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,200
and other quantity.

126
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,200
If you know this, you can just directly type this.

127
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:35,200
But most of the time, you have some implicit equation, right?

128
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,200
p, d, whatever is of 0.

129
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:42,200
And at every point, this algebraic relation has to be satisfied.

130
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,200
But then every point has its own solution.

131
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:50,200
So that's what you use domain algebraic equations for instead of global.

132
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,200
Just like that, we also have global and domain ODEs.

133
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:59,200
Let's say we are solving this population projection problem,

134
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,200
the local prey-predator equation.

135
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:08,200
Which one is the prey and which one is the predator in this equation?

136
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:13,200
Between u and v, if one was prey and one was predator.

137
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:18,200
Predator.

138
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,200
Look at the interaction terms.

139
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,200
Assuming all coefficients are positive,

140
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,200
a1, b1, a2, b2 are all positive.

141
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,200
Or non-negative at least.

142
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,200
u is the prey.

143
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,200
u is the prey, why would you say that?

144
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,200
Because when u and v meet, it's...

145
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:41,200
Yeah, basically when u and v meet, it's u's damage and v's gain.

146
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:46,200
So u is the prey, the other one is the predator.

147
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:52,200
So the way to specify this is we don't differentiate between algebraic and global equations.

148
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,200
You use the same global equation interface.

149
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,200
The only thing is...

150
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,200
I already have a solved model for this.

151
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,200
The only thing that you have to consider here is

152
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,200
when you enter this equation,

153
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,200
now instead of just being an algebraic equation, you are going to have derivatives.

154
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,200
Remember when we talked about derivative operators?

155
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,200
So if I...

156
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,200
Here also you enter everything is equal to 0.

157
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:19,200
So if I want du over dt is equal to something,

158
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,200
I would move the right-hand side to the left.

159
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:29,200
And I would write du over dt minus a1 u1 minus u over k minus b1 v is equal to 0.

160
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,200
Initial values of this I have parameterized here.

161
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:39,200
Initial prey and predator concentrations, carrying capacity,

162
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,200
these interaction terms.

163
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,200
But...

164
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,200
So now if you have this,

165
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,200
then you have to add the time-dependent solvers, specify the time you want,

166
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,200
and you just solve that.

167
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,200
So for example here what I get is for the initial values I started with,

168
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,200
the prey population goes down,

169
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,200
the predator population goes up.

170
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,200
At some point it runs out of food,

171
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,200
so then it will start...

172
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,200
declining.

173
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:17,200
But the major point here is that the global differential and algebraic equations,

174
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,200
they are just time derivatives, no special derivative.

175
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,200
You use the same interface.

176
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,200
Clear so far?

177
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,200
Okay.

178
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,200
Now...

179
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,200
We can have domain ODEs as well.

180
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,200
Here it's global ODEs.

181
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,200
Let's think about this.

182
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,200
Instead of talking about population projection,

183
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,200
maybe this is prey-predator relationship in one area,

184
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,200
let's say you are talking about a whole area.

185
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,200
Then different areas can have their own carrying capacity.

186
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,200
Different areas can have their own...

187
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,200
populations.

188
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:01,200
Maybe prey-predator interactions are going to have different outcomes based on location.

189
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,200
Maybe there is climate effect.

190
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,200
There's a special effect.

191
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,200
But...

192
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,200
But...

193
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,200
Still what we are having is ordinary differential equations at every point.

194
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:17,200
So here what we are assuming is there is no interaction between population at one point

195
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,200
or at another point.

196
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:27,200
So every point is independent of the neighbors.

197
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,200
So there is no keeping up with the Genesis or with the Cartesian

198
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,200
or whoever it is that people keep up with now.

199
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,200
Every point has its own evolution.

200
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,200
Irrespective of what happens on the neighbors.

201
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,200
But every point is different from another point.

202
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,200
So it's not a global equation.

203
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:52,200
Now the question here is how will this equation, this population model, become a partial differential equation?

204
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,200
Now we have...

205
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,200
I've made domain ODEs from global ODEs.

206
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:02,200
Can it become a PDE?

207
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,200
Any idea how it can become a PDE?

208
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:14,200
Any physical effects that can be treated to be mythic about it?

209
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:26,200
When we had a single population, this population equation was something like this.

210
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,200
For example, the predetermined population is going to be...

211
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,200
This derivative is going to be something containing U and W.

212
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,200
Can I have this term?

213
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,200
In this equation.

214
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,200
Is there any physical effect that can ever make it have this?

215
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,200
Transport?

216
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,200
Transport.

217
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,200
So in terms of population, what would that be?

218
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,200
Migration.

219
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,200
Yep.

220
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,200
This is not a proposal to solve today.

221
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,200
Especially...

222
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,200
What?

223
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,200
We prepared the presentation before.

224
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:12,200
Anyway, if you have migration, then we can assume...

225
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:21,200
One thing to assume is people migrate from high concentrated areas to low concentrated areas.

226
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,200
Maybe if that is the effect, you will have diffusion.

227
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,200
And you have an advection term in this equation.

228
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,200
So now if you have migration where people want to run away from high concentration areas,

229
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:39,200
you can have the advection term, the diffusion term.

230
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,200
But can you have any advection, any reason for adding advection?

231
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:49,200
Yeah, what would it be?

232
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:59,200
Yeah, so in terms of population projection, population analysis problem,

233
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,200
what would be an advection effect?

234
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,200
What would motivate...

235
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,200
Basically advection is...

236
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,200
Diffusion is you move based on the concentration, right?

237
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:15,200
Whereas advection is just a velocity irrespective of the concentration.

238
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,200
You have it with us.

239
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:22,200
People moving in a certain direction, and that's not going to be concentration dependent.

240
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,200
Why would that happen?

241
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,200
Why would anything like that happen?

242
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,200
.

243
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,200
.

244
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,200
Yeah, something like that.

245
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,200
Like more food or like some resource.

246
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:36,200
Remember the California boat rush, for example, right?

247
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,200
People find out, oh, there is good things at that place.

248
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:45,200
So irrespective of whatever population you have in this place, you might want to move.

249
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,200
So in that case, you might add advection terms.

250
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,200
The diffusion coefficient is positive.

251
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,200
What if we have negative diffusion coefficient?

252
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,200
.

253
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,200
.

254
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:01,200
So what is the assumption in having a positive diffusion coefficient?

255
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:06,200
We're saying move motion away from high concentration area.

256
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,200
What would then making that negative mean?

257
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,200
.

258
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,200
Huh?

259
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,200
.

260
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,200
Yeah, right?

261
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,200
What would that make out of the country?

262
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,200
.

263
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,200
.

264
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,200
.

265
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,200
.

266
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,200
.

267
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,200
.

268
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,200
.

269
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,200
.

270
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,200
.

271
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,200
.

272
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,200
.

273
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,200
.

274
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,200
.

275
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,200
.

276
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,200
.

277
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,200
.

278
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,200
.

279
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,200
.

280
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,200
.

281
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,200
.

282
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,200
It makes that, it helps everything, stuff that you can find, make it more obvious,

283
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:43,200
why it is happening, where nothing's happening.

284
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,200
.

285
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,200
.

286
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,200
.

287
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,200
.

288
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,200
.

289
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,200
.

290
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,200
.

291
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,200
.

292
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,200
.

293
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,200
.

294
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,680
and if migration is just to the higher direction,
