1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
Yeah, change the spatial discretization or change the time discretization, right?

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,000
So let me explain both cases.

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,400
So first of all, forward Euler is not the only way to integrate differential equations.

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:23,940
If you look at MATLAB's ODE45, it is using something that is a lot better than forward Euler.

5
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:29,920
Not only it is more accurate, it is fourth order and fifth order, but also the stability region is different.

6
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:38,900
For example, there is a well-known Rangakata scheme called RK4, fourth order Rangakata scheme,

7
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:47,560
whose stability region for real of lambda t and the imaginary of delta t lambda, the same thing, is something like that.

8
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:58,020
All right, so for the Rangakata scheme, fourth order, the scheme is stable in this region,

9
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,560
which actually includes...

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,900
All these points we are talking about lying on the imaginary axis.

11
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:10,920
So one solution is just to use RK4 to solve the equation.

12
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,940
It will be slightly more lines of code you need to write, but like, no problem.

13
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,200
Or just use ODE45.

14
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:20,700
You'll be okay.

15
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,420
All right?

16
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,700
So that is one solution.

17
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:29,700
Change time discretization.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:39,640
Another potential solution is change spatial discretization.

19
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,740
Spatial discretization.

20
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,140
All right.

21
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,080
So, for example, let's do a trade-off.

22
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,080
Instead of using...

23
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:59,080
Instead of using...

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,520
This is D.

25
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,760
Instead of using the more accurate central difference scheme,

26
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,760
let's use I plus 1 minus UI over delta t.

27
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:16,780
Let's bias towards one side to see what does it change stability.

28
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,700
We know it makes the accuracy worse, but can it make stability better?

29
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:22,900
Right?

30
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,600
So sometimes we have to do a trade-off between stability and accuracy.

31
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,900
So in this case, we plug in the same...

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,620
Free expansion here.

33
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:38,600
UI is equal to summation K of U head of K e to the J Ki delta x.

34
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:42,960
We get D U head of K dt on the left-hand side.

35
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:49,700
So this is from here plus U times U head of K from here.

36
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:58,700
And exponential of J K delta x minus...

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
U over...

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,660
Oh, so this is delta x over delta x equal to zero.

39
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:06,880
Right?

40
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,840
Is it clear how I got this?

41
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,340
This is basically plugging I plus 1 into here and factor it out.

42
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:26,660
The common term that is e to the J Ki delta x got pulled out, right, from both the D U dt and also this term and also this term.

43
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,220
So we are left with this.

44
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:42,640
And what we have is D U head of K dt equal to minus U, this guy over here, times U head of K.

45
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,080
Now, this is our lambda.

46
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,040
Any idea where it is on the complex plane?

47
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,360
So let's draw the complex plane.

48
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,580
And hopefully it is on this side.

49
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,960
So let's draw it a little bit like that.

50
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,160
So real of lambda, imaginary of lambda.

51
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,360
All right.

52
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:13,400
E to the J K delta x.

53
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:18,960
And again, remember K times delta x ranges from minus pi to pi.

54
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:24,680
Just because of the range of K and the relation between N and delta x.

55
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,220
So N times delta x equal to 2 pi.

56
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,960
And K goes from minus.

57
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,440
N over 2 to N over 2 minus 1.

58
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:42,440
So e to the J times something that ranges from minus pi to pi goes in where on the complex plane?

59
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:52,460
So let's say just a J x.

60
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,760
J x.

61
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,660
What is it?

62
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,980
It's a unit.

63
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:00,340
It's a unit circle.

64
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:00,760
Exactly.

65
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,940
That's the unit circle.

66
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:05,660
Okay.

67
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:12,680
As x goes from, when x is minus pi, it's over here.

68
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,260
And you go over here.

69
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,040
And goes all the way to here.

70
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:18,880
That's a unit circle.

71
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,240
Okay.

72
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,260
Unit circle minus 1 is going to shift it to here.

73
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,400
So that's this.

74
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,420
And, okay.

75
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,980
So minus 1 is going to shift.

76
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,560
It's going to shift it to here.

77
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,560
So the green line is e to the J x minus 1.

78
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:36,820
All right.

79
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,980
So this is the green one.

80
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,500
And that is multiplied.

81
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:49,000
So actually let me put it as lambda delta t.

82
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:57,640
So our analysis, we want to look at where this lambda delta t is.

83
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,540
Which is minus u.

84
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:11,780
So that's u times delta t over delta x times this green circle over here.

85
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:16,000
So we are expanding this green circle by a coefficient.

86
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:21,160
That is u times delta t divided by delta x.

87
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:28,180
So is that going to make us stable for forward roller?

88
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:37,240
So this part is on this green circle, right?

89
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,740
And we are multiplying green circle.

90
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,280
Remember, this is the origin.

91
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,800
We are multiplying the green circle by this number.

92
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,960
And if, for example, u is negative.

93
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,340
If u is negative, then this number is a positive number.

94
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,000
We are expanding this circle.

95
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,780
Expanding or shrinking this circle depending on if this is positive or negative.

96
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,560
For example, if.

97
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,460
If.

98
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:03,820
Minus u delta t over delta x is equal to 0.5.

99
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,960
What is it?

100
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,300
So this is minus 1.

101
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,300
This is minus 2.

102
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:19,000
If it's equal to 0.5, then my lambda delta t is going to be this circle shrinked by a factor of 2.

103
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,480
So instead of this being minus 2, this will be minus 1.

104
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,280
And instead of minus 1, it will be minus half.

105
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,480
This is actually within.

106
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:34,280
The stability region of forward roller, which is a circle that is twice as big as this.

107
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,660
So this is the stability region.

108
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:47,100
And all my eigenvalues lies on this smaller circle, which is completely contained in this big stability region.

109
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,240
Right?

110
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:56,580
So this is just an example of minus u times delta t over delta x equal to 0.5.

111
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,200
And in fact.

112
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:04,380
As long as this number lies in between 0 and 1.

113
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,460
The green circle is going to be contained in this black circle.

114
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:08,560
So.

115
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,340
Yes, that's a very good question.

116
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,440
If, for example.

117
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,100
You.

118
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:17,420
Okay.

119
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:17,780
So.

120
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,460
So if there are two cases where the scheme is unstable.

121
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:26,460
One case is if u delta t over delta x is positive.

122
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,280
Which means when I take a minus sign.

123
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,040
It's negative.

124
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,440
What is the effect of multiplying the green circle by a negative number?

125
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,580
What does it show up in the complex plane?

126
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,460
It flips into the right half of the complex plane.

127
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,260
Right?

128
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,020
So let's.

129
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,560
Let's add a page.

130
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:49,760
So.

131
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:51,500
Again.

132
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,660
Let's draw.

133
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:56,820
The stability region of forward roller.

134
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,160
Like this.

135
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:58,900
Minus 2.

136
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,100
Minus 1.

137
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,400
So let's draw the good case.

138
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,120
So this is.

139
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,060
Minus u.

140
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,040
Times delta t over delta x.

141
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:11,440
Again.

142
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,100
In this case.

143
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,660
This is called the CFL number.

144
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,620
Is within.

145
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,120
0 and 1.

146
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,640
So this is the green side.

147
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,020
This is the green circle.

148
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,640
The other case.

149
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,480
Is.

150
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,920
Minus u delta t over delta x.

151
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:29,780
Is.

152
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,520
Actually less than 0.

153
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,940
It'll flip the green.

154
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,740
To the blue side.

155
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,280
So it'll be a circle over here.

156
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,620
Which is completely unstable.

157
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,480
The third case.

158
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:42,780
Is.

159
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,280
Minus u delta t over delta x is greater than 1.

160
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,400
That means.

161
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,600
The green circle is going to expand.

162
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,280
Beyond the stability region.

163
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:53,940
It'll be.

164
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,400
A red circle that is like that.

165
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,160
Again.

166
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,560
It is completely beyond the stability region.

167
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:03,980
Therefore it doesn't work.

168
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,620
So the scheme.

169
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,340
We just derived.

170
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,340
Only works.

171
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,280
If u is negative.

172
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,280
And.

173
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,100
u times delta t over delta x.

174
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,020
Has a magnitude.

175
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,480
Less than 1.

176
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,960
Okay.

177
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,700
So in this case.

178
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,240
The stability.

179
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:25,520
The.

180
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,680
Criterion.

181
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:29,780
Is.

182
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,780
Minus u delta t over delta x.

183
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:31,280
Is.

184
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:31,780
Minus u delta t over delta x.

185
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,280
So.

186
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,340
U.

187
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,180
Negative.

188
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,380
And.

189
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,180
U delta t over delta x.

190
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,280
Less than 1.

191
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,160
So again.

192
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:41,860
This.

193
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:42,360
Is.

194
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,300
In this equation.

195
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,440
This is called the CFL number.

196
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,800
In both cases.

197
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:52,000
Our stability criterion involves the CFL number has a.

198
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,760
Has a magnitude less than something.

199
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,460
Yes.

200
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,780
Sorry.

201
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,520
What's your question.

202
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,660
What is the black circle?

203
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,760
What is the black circle?

204
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,920
The black circle is.

205
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,460
The stability.

206
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,240
Region.

207
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:12,720
Of.

208
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,160
Forward oler.

209
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:17,740
It is.

210
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,720
Imaginary of lambda delta t.

211
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,440
And the real of lambda delta t.

212
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:27,080
So lambda is the eigenvalue.

213
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:28,520
Of.

214
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:29,780
Is.

215
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,280
Is.

216
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:30,780
So now.

217
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,280
Is.

218
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:31,780
Is the.

219
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,920
Is the coefficient.

220
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,500
Of the differential equation of the ODE.

221
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,160
And delta t is the time step of the ODE.

222
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,280
U.

223
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,600
Very good point.

224
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:44,480
If.

225
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,320
If I.

226
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,460
Like I think your point is.

227
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,660
If I look at.

228
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,820
If I define x to be minus x.

229
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,520
Then in the differential equation.

230
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,660
My time derivative is still the same.

231
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,520
My spatial derivative flips up.

232
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,680
So I get a u that is opposite.

233
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,920
So that can be an excellent solution.

234
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,480
Alternatively or basically equivalently.

235
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,880
Instead of.

236
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,680
Taking.

237
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,920
What we call.

238
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,480
Where's the equation.

239
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,980
Instead of taking.

240
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:17,920
Oh no this is.

241
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,740
This is.

242
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,240
The.

243
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:19,560
Okay.

244
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,000
Instead of taking the.

245
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,180
Forward difference.

246
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,720
Involving i plus one and i.

247
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,460
The equivalent of flipping sine.

248
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,580
Flipping the sine of x.

249
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,360
Is like taking a what difference.

250
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,760
A backward difference.

251
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,260
Exactly.

252
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:35,620
So.

253
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,360
That is.

254
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,360
Now.

255
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,120
If.

256
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,060
U is greater than zero.

257
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,980
Then the proper scheme.

258
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,400
I should be using.

259
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,120
Is du i dt.

260
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,820
Plus big u times u i minus u.

261
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,160
i minus one divided by delta x is equal to zero.

262
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,700
That's taking a backward.

263
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,260
Scheme.

264
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,700
The stability.

265
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,500
Criterion of this one would be u greater than zero.

266
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,740
And also u delta t over delta x.

267
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:07,840
Less than one.

268
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,960
Actually you saved me a lot of analysis.

269
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,300
Because the analysis here is exactly like flipping space.

270
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,680
And do the same analysis.

271
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,880
That's great.

272
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,560
Right.

273
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:20,760
Okay.

274
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,040
So in both cases.

275
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,920
When we look at the.

276
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,180
Discretized operator.

277
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,300
And let me actually.

278
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,840
Write it down here.

279
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,780
So this is our scheme.

280
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,780
Partial.

281
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,780
I was trying to use red.

282
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,780
Partial.

283
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,780
So du i dt.

284
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:39,780
Plus u.

285
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:43,780
u i plus one minus u i over delta x.

286
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,780
Equal to zero.

287
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,780
So in both cases.

288
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,780
We are biasing.

289
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,780
The spatial points we are using.

290
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,780
Towards which side.

291
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,780
When u is less than zero.

292
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,780
We are biasing towards the right.

293
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,140
So.

294
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:57,640
We are.

295
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,140
We are.

296
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,140
We are biasing towards the right side.

297
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,140
When u is less than zero.

298
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,140
We are biasing towards the left side.

299
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:06,140
And do you remember how the differential equation behaves.

300
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,140
For positive or negative u.

301
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:11,140
It's like a wave.

302
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,140
Right.

303
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,140
And for different.

304
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,140
Let me actually just go back to.

305
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,140
I think lecture two.

306
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,140
No.

307
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,140
Is it lecture three.

308
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,140
No.

309
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,140
Maybe lecture one.

310
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:26,140
Is it demos.

311
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,140
Yeah.

312
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,140
Convection.

313
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,140
Yeah.

314
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,140
Okay.

315
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,140
Okay.

316
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,140
So we are using.

317
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,140
One zero.

318
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,140
So if we do that.

319
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,140
We are having a positive view.

320
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,140
And the solution goes towards the right.

321
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,140
Right.

322
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,140
If we have.

323
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,140
And in this case.

324
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,140
When solution goes to right.

325
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,140
We are using left biased.

326
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,140
Great points.

327
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,140
On the other way.

328
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,140
We are looking at the u minus one.

329
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,140
The solution goes towards the left.

330
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,140
And.

331
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,140
We are.

332
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,140
Having a.

333
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,140
This.

334
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,140
This.

335
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,140
This.

336
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,140
That.

337
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,140
And.

338
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,140
This.

339
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,140
This.

340
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,140
That.

341
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,140
This.

342
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,200
and it goes towards the left.
