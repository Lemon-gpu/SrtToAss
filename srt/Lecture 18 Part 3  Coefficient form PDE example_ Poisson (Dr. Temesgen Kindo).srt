1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,560
I will demonstrate this with an example. Is it clear so far?

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,140
Yeah?

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:18,840
You can make it non-dimensional.

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,240
Yeah.

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,600
For the conversion, which one is better?

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:29,840
If you normalize the data, it's not because the conversion or it's because the T is too

7
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:30,840
hard or something?

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,840
OK.

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:38,140
So if I get your question properly, you're asking if you don't non-dimensionalize in

10
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:44,440
the convergence, the quantity of the error it's calculating is going to be dimensional.

11
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,600
And how is that then going to be handled?

12
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,600
Yeah.

13
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,600
OK.

14
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,600
That's a good question.

15
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,600
So how it is handled is if you don't dimensionalize.

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:59,080
In the solver sequence, you pick a scaling for your independent file.

17
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,540
So you can specify a scaling, how it should scale it.

18
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:07,780
So it will actually divide the solver when it calculates the error before it puts it

19
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,240
into a tolerance.

20
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,240
It will divide it by the scaling you provide.

21
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,240
Then I don't need to change my equation, right?

22
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,240
No.

23
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,240
Just use the, all of them in the term of the habit dimensions?

24
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,240
Yeah.

25
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,240
You have dimensions and you can change it.

26
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:21,280
OK.

27
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,080
And then in the convergence check, you would put a scaling.

28
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,080
OK.

29
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,080
Yeah.

30
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,080
Does that answer the question?

31
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,080
OK.

32
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,420
So let's say we want to model the Poisson equation to start simple with a boundary

33
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,420
condition 0, a boundary condition 0 everywhere.

34
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:44,080
Now the way you use this template is by just matching the templates with the equation you

35
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,080
have.

36
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,080
What is the template?

37
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,760
The template is this, what we have in the domain.

38
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,080
But what is your equation?

39
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,080
Your equation.

40
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,560
It's the first equation.

41
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,560
So you don't have all these terms.

42
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,560
What do we have?

43
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:02,560
If you have c is equal to 1 and f is equal to 1 and everything else 0 in that equation,

44
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,840
you get the Poisson equation, right?

45
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,240
With the source term being 1.

46
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,060
So then you have your set in the domain.

47
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,940
Then now you want to pick what happens in the boundary.

48
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,600
So for what happens in the boundary, this is going to be a Drischli boundary condition.

49
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,600
The template is going to be u is equal to 1.

50
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,600
So you have the first equation.

51
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,600
If you have a set of 2, you have the second one.

52
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,600
So if you have r is equal to 0, then you get the Poisson equation.

53
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,600
Thank you.

54
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,600
So what happens is that you get r is equal to 0.

55
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,600
But then if you don't have it, for what?

56
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,600
If you had r is equal to r, then here what we have is r is equal to 0.

57
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,980
So just put r is equal to 0 and you are done.

58
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:34,960
So I will now go into the software and show how to enter this.

59
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,480
Is it clear so far?

60
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,480
Okay.

61
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:45,520
So if I start the software here, when you start a new model, as you would have seen

62
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,600
on Monday, you can start with a model wizard or a blank wizard.

63
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,600
If you started with a model wizard, you can becomes a model wizard on Monday.

64
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,600
It's pretty easy.

65
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,660
The first thing is you have to select your special dimension.

66
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,860
Let's say we are going to do a 2D problem.

67
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,040
Then you pick 2D.

68
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:05,340
Then you pick your physics, but in this case, you're not going to use any of the pre-built physics-based interfaces.

69
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,240
You are going to use the mathematics interface.

70
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,320
And you come here, you come to PDE.

71
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,880
We're going to use the coefficient form now.

72
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,560
I'll show you the general form later.

73
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,560
So you use the coefficient form, add that.

74
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,760
And here you can decide what to call the independent variable.

75
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,320
So by default, it wants to call it U.

76
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,380
But if you're, for example, solving a temperature problem,

77
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:41,340
and you want this to be similar to the variable name you are using often, then you can rename it.

78
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,180
And here you specify the units for the dimension and for the source there.

79
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,880
So let's leave this as it is now.

80
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:51,920
Study.

81
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,460
Then you pick your study type.

82
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,760
Are you doing a stationary study?

83
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,820
Is this an equilibrium problem where the time derivatives are all zero now?

84
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,440
Or is this a time-dependent problem, an eigenvalue problem?

85
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,480
So let's say this is a stationary problem.

86
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,000
Yes?

87
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,720
The equation is stationary, but it's not finding.

88
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:14,960
I just can call it a function.

89
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,080
Yeah.

90
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,620
But at this point, we haven't really specified the equation.

91
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:24,260
All we have said is we want to use equation-based modeling.

92
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,140
Right?

93
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,080
Yeah.

94
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,420
But that's a good concern.

95
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,440
I'll show you what happens.

96
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,320
So here you would define your geometry.

97
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,480
Let's say we just want to solve this on a unit square.

98
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:43,200
And I right-click on geometry, pick square, pick the dimensions, one by one.

99
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,660
Let's say the default was one.

100
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,260
So this is my domain.

101
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,260
Now the next thing is if I, there are three nodes here.

102
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:56,980
Your equation, your default boundary condition, and your initial condition.

103
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,860
Now let's go to the equation.

104
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,080
This is the equation.

105
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,860
And if you expand this equation section here, you will see the template.

106
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,500
So it's saying it wants to solve this.

107
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,980
Now you have to specify what is c.

108
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,360
C is in our case one.

109
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,100
So we keep c is equal to one.

110
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,580
If we had no source term, we will come back and put this f to zero.

111
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:29,280
Then, okay, now I have ea set to zero by default, ba to one.

112
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,220
But these values are zero, right?

113
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,520
I can type zero, but I can also not type them.

114
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,880
Because in a stationary study, it will ignore the time derivatives.

115
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:44,580
So let's say I actually had a non-zero mass term.

116
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,480
First, I want to solve it.

117
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,580
For a stationary case.

118
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,300
Next, I want to solve it for a time-dependent case.

119
00:05:52,380 --> 00:06:00,520
So instead of putting the equation twice, I can just add another study, but make that study time-dependent.

120
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,140
So the stationary study will ignore the time derivative.

121
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,700
The transient study will keep the time derivative.

122
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,480
Does that address your question?

123
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:16,000
So, yes, I can put this to zero, but the time derivatives are ignored anyway in a stationary study.

124
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,440
And then you can check this other coefficient.

125
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,340
They are all zero.

126
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,800
What we want is this.

127
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,740
Now, actually, we're just solving the Laplace equation since I put f is equal to zero.

128
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,800
Then the next thing is the boundary condition.

129
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:36,500
The boundary conditions are setting the Neumann boundary condition to zero.

130
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,280
That's the default.

131
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,920
So basically, physics-wise, that's no flux of the quantity you are conserving.

132
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,340
So in a chemical reaction problem, this would be no concentration,

133
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:46,540
cross-division, no flux.

134
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:53,520
So in the boundary, in a structural mechanics problem, the momentum flux being stress, it would mean free of stress.

135
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:58,140
But if your boundary conditions are different from the default, you specify them.

136
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:06,660
So if I right-click here, right, on the physics or on the equation, these ones are things I could do on the domain.

137
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,360
But these ones are boundary condition.

138
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,740
So in our case, we have a Richelieu boundary condition.

139
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,400
I click that.

140
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,500
Then you choose where to apply this.

141
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:23,300
I could keep clicking, but if you are applying them for all boundary, you can also use this all boundaries.

142
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,160
Then what is this?

143
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,940
What is your solution outside?

144
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:35,160
We are using here u is equal to zero.

145
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:39,620
So if I specify that, that is already zero.

146
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,740
Then you build your mesh, and now you solve.

147
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:51,660
Now this is going to give me a zero solution back.

148
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,660
I'm solving the Laplace equation with zero boundary conditions.

149
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,980
But what we wanted to do was the Poisson equation.

150
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:05,980
So if I go back to the coefficient form and put f is equal to one and solve that.

151
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,420
What?

152
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,160
I put the boundary condition.

153
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:19,540
Oh, I put constraints.

154
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,260
I should have put the Richelieu boundary condition.

155
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:26,580
All boundaries.

156
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:26,880
Okay.

157
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,380
So this is Poisson equation with source terms equal to one.

158
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:42,040
I mean, here I can post-process it for other quantities, maybe make a contour plot

159
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:45,660
or maybe here instead of just surface.

160
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:45,760
Okay.

161
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,320
So I can do that.

162
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,560
So I can do the surface, add a height expression.

163
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,660
This would be my solution.

164
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:04,400
But the idea is if you're using the coefficient form, you just come here in the equations template,

165
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:13,700
and then you fill in these terms so that the template matches the equation you have.

166
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,300
Here I have initial values.

167
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:23,300
In the time-dependent, in a time-dependent problem, those are physically meaningful quantities

168
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,060
of where did you start?

169
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,240
Where are you starting?

170
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:31,060
What was the state of your problem at t is equal to zero or whenever you start solving

171
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:31,640
this problem?

172
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:39,140
But for a stationary problem, they don't have any physical meaning.

173
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:43,200
But can you think of a way they can be useful?

174
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,300
Any guess?

175
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,780
Yeah, can you make it more, can you elaborate more?

176
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:54,780
Convergence and next configuration?

177
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,400
Exactly.

178
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,260
So these equations are potentially nonlinear, right?

179
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:04,240
In this case, you win the first time.

180
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:11,460
In this case, we are solving a linear problem but think of solving this nonlinear problem.

181
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,460
What happens?

182
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,100
The weak form will convert this and then when you add the finite element it's going to tell

183
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,100
this.

184
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,100
So what happens?

185
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:22,100
at the end what you will have is a system of nonlinear algebraic equations for the nodal

186
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,100
values.

187
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,980
So when you have nonlinear algebraic equations, you're going to solve them using a Newton-Raphson

188
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,600
or other method like that.

189
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:36,380
And there, you are going to start with an initial value and iteratively try to get to

190
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,800
your solution.

191
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,540
So even though this initial value is not, it's physically meaningless for a stationary

192
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,860
problem, you can nudge it.

193
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:49,660
If you have any a priori information, if you have some estimate about your solution, you

194
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:56,300
can type that in and then it will help the solver converge faster.

195
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:00,120
Or this is assuming you have a unique solution.

196
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:05,000
In cases where you have multiple solutions, you can also use this initial value to sort

197
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
of bias, right?

198
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,840
It will most likely converge to the solution closer to the initial value you are putting

199
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,340
in.

200
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,040
Okay.
