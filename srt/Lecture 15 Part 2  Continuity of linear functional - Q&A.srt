1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,700
So this is for linear functionals.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:12,620
So that's one of the conditions that we need for the well-posedness of a weak form like that.

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,540
The right-hand side, the linear functional, has to be bounded or continuous.

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:21,740
If you don't have a continuous, let's say if you have a right-hand side,

5
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:25,520
that is even more non-smooth than the delta function.

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,080
Then the Poisson's equation doesn't have to have a solution even in the weak sense.

7
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:37,300
But in this case, because the delta function is a bounded linear functional for H1,

8
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,240
and our weak form for Poisson's equation we did last lecture is defining H1,

9
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,360
therefore we still have a perfectly valid solution.

10
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:51,940
And we can do error analysis and a bunch of things for finite element

11
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:55,500
if we have a Poisson's equation with a delta function being the right-hand side.

12
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:04,200
Is your question if you define L of V as the integral of the function between 0 and 1?

13
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,600
What do you mean by a step function between 0 and 2?

14
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:15,640
And you're saying you're going to replace the delta function with a step function?

15
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:16,740
Is that right?

16
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:25,500
So L of V is a function that maps from a linear space, from a functional space.

17
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,900
To a field, let's say the field of real numbers.

18
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,840
Okay, so the result of the L of V has to be a number.

19
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,860
So what do you mean by L of V is a step function?

20
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:49,200
I can define this, I can replace the delta function by a step function, for example.

21
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,780
That'll be a perfectly valid linear function though.

22
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:53,940
Is that true?

23
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,460
Yeah, exactly.

24
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,940
Okay, so we can do the same thing.

25
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:03,300
The example we are taking here is L2 and H1.

26
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,860
The L2 space and H1 space.

27
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,260
L2 space is all the functions whose square is integrable.

28
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,360
H1 is all the functions, is the space of all the functions whose square is integrable

29
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,060
and also have square integrable derivatives.

30
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:19,280
Yes.

31
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,020
All right.

32
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,480
Does that answer?

33
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:25,880
Your question?

34
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,780
Oh, okay.

35
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,560
I mean, if you're still confused, keep asking.

36
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,320
Okay.

37
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,680
Any other questions?

38
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,100
Okay.

39
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,580
So this is what we have to have for L of V.
