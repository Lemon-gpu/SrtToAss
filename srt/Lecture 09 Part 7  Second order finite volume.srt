1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,880
What we have just derived works great for near discontinuities, but it doesn't

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:15,660
really work great in smooth regions. And we can probably see this from the

3
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:23,580
solution over here. So in this solution, can you see the obvious place

4
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:31,680
that is not accurate? Can you see a feature of this solution where you can

5
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:39,660
point it and say, okay, this should not be the proper behavior? Yes?

6
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:52,580
Exactly. So look at the slope over here and the gap between the line and y equal to 1.

7
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:53,560
So look at the slope over here and the gap between the line and y equal to 1.

8
00:00:53,560 --> 00:01:06,020
The gap should not exist. Okay? So the wave is losing magnitude even before the discontinuity forms.

9
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:14,320
So remember, before any shock wave forms, the solution follows characteristic lines.

10
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:21,900
And if you follow the characteristic line of this point of x equal to a quarter,

11
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,540
the characteristic line of x equal to a quarter is the same as the characteristic line of x equal to a quarter.

12
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:27,980
The characteristic should move towards the right, and the solution along the characteristic should be what?

13
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,240
Constant. Yes. So if you move towards the right along the characteristic,

14
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:39,780
the solution should stay at u equal to 1. It should not decay in magnitude.

15
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:48,880
So the fact that the solution gets artificially dissipated is called what?

16
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,880
Artificial dissipation, right? So it's a diffusion.

17
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:57,780
Dissipation error. So dispersion error, dissipation error, remember,

18
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,880
dispersion error is moving the wave to the wrong places.

19
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,880
Dissipation error is artificially damping down the waves.

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,700
The first order upwind or Godunov scheme, they both have a lot of dissipation error in it.

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,880
And it's pretty obvious in this case.

22
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:23,480
So how do we improve upon the scheme to make it higher order?

23
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,540
Oops.

24
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:35,540
So the idea comes from a place called reconstruction.

25
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:42,200
The reconstruction, it's saying that we already see one case of reconstruction,

26
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,420
that is the piecewise constant reconstruction.

27
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,440
In the first order upwind scheme and in the Godunov scheme,

28
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:53,440
we both have reconstructed the solution from the piecewise constant reconstruction.

29
00:02:53,540 --> 00:03:00,540
So we can say that the solution is not going to be a piecewise volume averages.

30
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,540
So let's draw three functions.

31
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:06,540
One function is an original function that looks like that.

32
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,540
Okay.

33
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:20,540
And then the second is not a function, but just a series of numbers that is taking the value of the average.

34
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,540
That's probably this point.

35
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,540
Maybe this point and here, maybe that point.

36
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,540
So it's taking the volume averages.

37
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,540
And the third function is the reconstruction.

38
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:37,540
And the reconstruction is what is not done well in the Godunov scheme.

39
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,540
In Godunov scheme, we are doing a piecewise constant reconstruction.

40
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:51,540
We are drawing a flat line over each interval that approximates the value of the function.

41
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:57,540
And of course, if you just look at the difference between the green function and the red function,

42
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:01,540
you can see that the approximation is not very good.

43
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,540
Right?

44
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:10,540
So the question is, in what way can we perform a better reconstruction of the function,

45
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,540
a more accurate reconstruction function?

46
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:19,540
And so, for example, if we want a second order scheme instead of just a first order scheme,

47
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:23,540
we can reconstruct the function using just a slightly different way.

48
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:29,540
So instead of just using the function value at this grid point,

49
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:33,540
how can we reconstruct the function to make it better?

50
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,540
For example, we can also look at the slope.

51
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:45,540
So if we have the blue point over here, we know the cell average here locally is a monotonically decreasing trend.

52
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,540
We can use the difference between this and this and this and this.

53
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:55,540
To figure out, okay, can I draw a straight line like that,

54
00:04:55,540 --> 00:05:02,540
which respects the average slope between this and this and this and this?

55
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:07,540
So that I actually get a better approximation to the red function.

56
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:14,540
So not just using the volume averages, but also using the derivative information,

57
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,540
which we can infer from the adjacent volume averages.

58
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:25,540
That's a good way to reconstruct the solution to better accuracy.

59
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,540
So let's say we have the reconstruction here.

60
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,540
We also can probably perform a reconstruction here.

61
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,540
The reconstruction here is a little bit more tricky, but maybe something like that.

62
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:39,540
And over here, it may be something like that.

63
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,540
Okay?

64
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:45,540
We still have a piecewise continuous function.

65
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,540
No longer have a piecewise constant function.

66
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,540
But still.

67
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:53,540
It's a piecewise linear function instead.

68
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:58,540
We still need to figure out what is the appropriate flux to use,

69
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:03,540
for example, around this interface, where I still have a discontinuity.

70
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:08,540
Where here, I still have a discontinuity, maybe even larger.

71
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,540
Right?

72
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:15,540
So what do I do here?

73
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:20,540
I can use exactly the same flux reconstruction scheme.

74
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:24,540
I can still use the same good enough numerical flux over here.

75
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:28,540
But instead of using just the piecewise averages,

76
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:37,540
I can use the reconstructed value immediately on the left and on the right of that interface.

77
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:44,540
So this is the idea we use to get second-order accuracy.

78
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,540
Okay?

79
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,540
So, for example,

80
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:54,540
I hope I have enough time to do that.

81
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,540
So I can copy my upwind.

82
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:03,540
Yeah, because I know my upwind works in this particular case,

83
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:07,540
I'll just use upwind instead of changing that to good enough.

84
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:12,540
So reconstruct upwind.

85
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,540
Okay.

86
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:23,540
So, okay.

87
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:31,540
So here, instead of just using the solution u to compute the flux,

88
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:43,540
I'm going to reconstruct at the interfaces.

89
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,540
All right.

90
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:53,540
So, for example,

91
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:59,540
I can compute the du dx to be,

92
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,540
we are going to use central difference here,

93
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:07,540
u of 3 to n minus u of 1 to n minus 2

94
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,540
divided by 2 delta x.

95
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,540
Oops.

96
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,540
All right.

97
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:25,540
So I have my du dx and my u at the right of the cell is going to be,

98
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:29,540
let me see, u at the right of the cell.

99
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,540
Okay.

100
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,540
So let me also du dx is equal to,

101
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:36,540
I also want to u at the first cell.

102
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:41,540
I'll just use first-order difference minus u1.

103
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:53,540
So u at the first cell is going to be u at the right of the cell.

104
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,540
So, u at the right of the cell is equal to u plus du dx upon 0.5 by dx.

105
00:08:55,540 --> 00:09:01,540
So u at the right of the cell is equal to u plus du dx upon 0.5 by dx.

106
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:07,540
So this is my reconstructed value immediately on the left of u i plus half.

107
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,540
Okay.

108
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,540
So if I say that this is the value of u,

109
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,540
I can do that.

110
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,540
So that's the result.

111
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:23,460
the left of u i plus half u at the left of the cell is equal to u minus du dx times this

112
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:37,220
all right so when i compute my f i also have my f at the right of the cell is equal to

113
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:48,580
this and my f equal to left cell is equal to that

114
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:56,980
yeah so so this this is still my first order optimus scheme if you use good enough scheme

115
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:04,900
these are something you don't actually want to compute right you want to compute the f as you

116
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,900
want to look at the u right cell and you want to add this to the right整 есте fool decía

117
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:07,120
so но又改變了

118
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,200
這 responding模式 對方的 ру HAVE YOU PUT THIS OUT

119
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,060
u left cell, and you want to compute the maximum, you want to compare which one is larger, and

120
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,800
you want to, depending on which one is larger, you want to compute the maximum or minimum

121
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,940
of the flux within that range.

122
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:19,800
Okay.

123
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,960
So, I don't know if we have, we probably don't have time to do that.

124
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,280
So, okay.

125
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,540
So, let me just do one thing before we finish.

126
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:39,340
So, let's don't do that yet.

127
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:43,800
So, the one thing we want to do before we finish is that when we look at the shock speed,

128
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,000
what U should we look at?

129
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:48,980
Right.

130
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:57,340
We want to use U of left cell for the range of 2 to n.

131
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:04,740
We want to use left cell of I plus 1, because we are looking at the interface I plus half

132
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,180
over here.

133
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:12,820
We want to use the value immediately to the right of the interface is the value at the

134
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,260
left of the next cell.

135
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:21,520
And the value immediately to the left of the interface is the value at the right side of

136
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,420
the cell immediately to the left.

137
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,520
So, this is the proper shock speed to use.

138
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:28,900
Okay.

139
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,180
And F interface is...

140
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,180
If the shock speed is greater than zero...

141
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,160
If the shock speed is greater than zero...

142
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,000
Coming from the left, I want to use the left.

143
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:43,220
So, F, which is F right cell of I minus 1.

144
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,040
If the shock is...

145
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:51,160
If the information coming from the right, I want to use the value immediately to the

146
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:56,100
right, which is the left cell of I.

147
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,160
Okay.

148
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:03,560
So, that is going to give us a second order reconstruction.

149
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:03,880
Okay.

150
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,440
So, let's do...

151
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:12,540
Hopefully...

152
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:18,440
Reconstruction, not reconstruction.

153
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:30,800
Here, which line?

154
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,380
U2 minus U1.

155
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:34,520
Okay.

156
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:34,560
Okay.

157
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:34,600
Okay.

158
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:34,620
Okay.

159
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:34,700
Okay.

160
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:34,760
Okay.

161
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:35,800
Thank you.

162
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:39,700
Okay.

163
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,480
All right.

164
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,580
So, we can see that this no longer diminishes.

165
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:50,900
Right?

166
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,640
So, let me run it longer.

167
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,480
I will tell you, I still will have a problem at the shock wave.

168
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,060
Okay.

169
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,140
I still have...

170
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,280
I still going to see problems at the shock wave.

171
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,580
It's a little bit better than what we see last time, but like this is still going to have a problem.

172
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:04,640
Okay.

173
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:04,700
Okay.

174
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:09,860
But if this still appears and we will see that we have to switch the scheme to a first

175
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:15,620
order scheme near the shock waves and keep the reconstruction to second order away from

176
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:19,100
the shock waves and that's the limiter we will be talking about in the next lecture.
