1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,940
Last lecture we put finite element in a more general and rigorous footing.

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:13,760
We defined finite element as a formulation completely removed from the differential equations.

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:21,180
A finite element starts with the weak form of a differential equation.

4
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:37,740
And a weak form is defined by a bilinear functional A equal to a linear functional L for all the possible Vs in the test space XV.

5
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,560
And we are finding a solution to this weak form.

6
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:51,160
The solution U has to lie in a potentially different space, X.

7
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:56,480
So this is generally a weak form of a differential equation.

8
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:04,380
And we derived the weak form for the Poisson's equation, a second order derivative.

9
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,160
And we also derived for an equation with a fourth order derivative.

10
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:20,200
So in both cases, the bilinear functional is the integral of the product of certain derivatives of U and certain derivatives of V.

11
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:27,780
And the linear functional is the integral of the product between the test function V and a known function F.

12
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:38,400
So in this lecture, we'll start from this weak form and analyze some properties of our finite element solutions.

13
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:46,760
So first of all, we want to analyze the weak form actually is stable and has a unique solution.

14
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,760
And we will derive conditions for this.

15
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,080
So we will derive conditions for the weak form that is going to give us a unique solution that is stable.

16
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:05,520
And then we know on the what assumptions we can continue to discuss our finite element to look at how much error our finite element is making.

17
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:14,220
The error analysis we are studying in this lecture is quite different from the kind of error analysis we are studying finite difference and finite volume.

18
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,360
Because instead of studying the Taylor series analysis, looking at the error in the Taylor series analysis,

19
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,960
we are studying the Taylor series analysis, looking at the error in the Taylor series analysis,

20
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,880
we are studying the Taylor series expansion.

21
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:32,960
We are now looking at errors in functional spaces that is removed from like the local type of analysis we have been doing before.

22
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:42,960
So first of all, let's define the situations in which the finite element, the weak form is actually well defined.

23
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:50,340
So a weak form is first of all well defined for the when the functional on the right hand side has two functions.

24
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:50,840
So a weak form is first of all well defined for the when the functional on the right hand side has two functions.

25
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,240
So a weak form is first of all well defined for the when the functional on the right hand side has two functions.

26
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,340
So l of v is continuous.

27
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:06,440
If and only if, which is the definition of the continuity is that,

28
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:16,900
l of v if I take the norm, whatever norm we have on this x v.

29
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,640
Divided by the norm of the v,

30
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:32,380
is bounded. So the maximum or supremum of this over the entire space xv has to be less than

31
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:40,700
infinity. So the supremum is basically a notion of maximum over infinite possible

32
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:48,060
candidates, right? So because the space of xv has infinitely many members,

33
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:57,420
so supremum is basically taking the maximum over that space. Or it says that, or equivalently,

34
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:12,600
equivalently, there exists a maximum, let's say c, such that the ratio between l of v

35
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:18,040
and the norm of v is less than that c.

36
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:23,940
For all the possible v's, right? These two are equivalent.

37
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,620
Okay, so this is what we mean by continuity of a linear functional.

38
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:37,420
It's also called bounded, right? So it's bounded because this supremum is actually,

39
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:47,640
can be defined as the norm of this l, right? This l have a norm, it's called the induced norm.

40
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:57,020
It's induced because it's induced by the norm of the vector it operates on, right? And the l of v,

41
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:03,780
oh sorry, l of v is a number. So the norm it takes is just the norm of the number. So it can be just

42
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:09,660
an absolute value. If the result of l of v is a real number, then it's just an absolute value.

43
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:16,740
So let me make this a bit clearer. So l of v is just going to be

44
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:27,140
a number. So it's the ratio between the magnitude of l of v divided by the norm of the v, right?

45
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:38,360
Okay, so let's say, for example, a delta function. A delta function is a linear functional, right?

46
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,720
It's linear because, let's say, example.

47
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:59,080
A delta function of x is a linear functional in the sense that

48
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:16,300
I can define l of v being integration over a domain, let's say, minus 1 to 1, delta x times v of x dx.

49
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:24,340
Is this linear functional a bounded or continuous linear functional?

50
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,620
No, we have different answers and all the answers can be correct.

51
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,820
Because we haven't defined what space, what this norm is, right?

52
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:44,440
So you can only answer is it a linear function, is it bounded or not, once you define a space,

53
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,040
define a space of v. And if you define different spaces, you can only define a space of v.

54
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,960
So if you define different spaces, the norm on the space is going to be different.

55
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:57,560
So if we are in l2 space, the norm of a function is the integral of the squared function.

56
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:03,560
If we are in the sub left space, h1, for example, the norm of the same function becomes different.

57
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:08,700
You have to add the integral of the derivative squared into the norm.

58
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:17,700
So let's take the simpler case first. If in the l2 space, is this linear functional or bounded?

59
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,060
Is this linear functional or bounded?

60
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:24,060
So somebody answered yes and no, right?

61
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,060
Who answered yes?

62
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:32,060
And in l2 space, do you still hold your yes answer?

63
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:36,060
You think so, okay.

64
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:43,060
And can you give me, so what c do you think can you derive? How would you derive this c?

65
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:47,060
The integral of v times x squared of c.

66
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,060
Is that right?

67
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:51,060
So c is equal to v at x equal to 0.

68
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,060
Yeah, but this is for any v, right?

69
00:07:55,060 --> 00:08:02,060
We have to get a c, get a bound that holds for any v.

70
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,060
c equal to 1?

71
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:09,060
Okay, so why do you think c equal to 1 work?

72
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:13,060
Hmm?

73
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:17,060
By Cauchy-Schwarz inequality?

74
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:24,060
Yeah, this is a dot product of two functions.

75
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:33,060
And so if you use Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, you would get less or equal to the same integral of delta x squared dx,

76
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:37,060
which I don't know what it is, right?

77
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,060
Times something else.

78
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,060
So I don't think that works.

79
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:46,060
Actually, if you really look at the square of the delta function integrated,

80
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,060
I think you get infinity.

81
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,060
Right, think of you get a spike, narrower and narrower,

82
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:55,060
whose integral is equal to 1, and you square it.

83
00:08:55,060 --> 00:09:00,060
You make it like a lot larger than, you make the integral a lot larger than 1.

84
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,060
Okay.

85
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:07,060
Who said no?

86
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,060
Who said no just now?

87
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,060
Did you say no?

88
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:14,060
So who said this is not a bounded linear function?

89
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,060
No.

90
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:20,060
Nobody?

91
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:24,060
Okay, this is not a bounded linear function of L2.

92
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:28,060
Why is that the case?

93
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:37,060
Why is the case is because the value of this linear functional can be arbitrarily large

94
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:41,060
for a V whose L2 norm is equal to 1.

95
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,060
Okay, so let me construct this kind of V.

96
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:53,060
So X, V, okay, I was looking at from minus 1 to 1, right?

97
00:09:53,060 --> 00:10:00,060
Of course, I can have a function that is equal to,

98
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:09,060
let me construct a function that is equal to 1 between minus half and half.

99
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:14,060
This function, of course, has, if you square it, it will be the same function,

100
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,060
and if you integrate it, you get 1.

101
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:20,060
So the L2 norm of this function is 1, right?

102
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:27,060
And the linear functional evaluated on this function is going to be the value of this function at 0.

103
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,060
So the linear function is 1.

104
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,060
But I can do some tricks.

105
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:38,060
What I can do is I can make the value at 0 equal to 2.

106
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:42,060
And just by shrinking,

107
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,060
by shrinking the area on which it is non-zero to,

108
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:50,060
instead of minus half, I have 1 minus 1 eighth and plus 1 eighth.

109
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,060
And this function, if you square it,

110
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:57,060
you get a value of 4 integrated over a length of 1 fourth.

111
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,060
You still get the L2 norm of 1,

112
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:02,060
but now I can make the value of the linear functional higher.

113
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,060
And I can keep doing this.

114
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:09,060
And I can keep increasing the magnitude of the function at X equal to 0

115
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,060
and shrink the support,

116
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:15,060
shrink the area over which the function is non-zero to,

117
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,060
so the function is non-zero.

118
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,060
But...

119
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:25,060
Yeah, V equal to delta of X is not a proper function, right?

120
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:29,060
So basically, you can keep shrinking the support

121
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:34,060
so that the V goes closer and closer to something like a delta function.

122
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,060
And by doing that,

123
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:43,060
we are going to get the ratio of L of V over the L2 norm of V

124
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,060
that is going unbounded,

125
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,060
and L2 goes to infinity.

126
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,060
So we have no bound.

127
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:55,060
The delta function is not a bounded linear functional in L2.

128
00:11:55,060 --> 00:12:03,060
But it turns out the delta function is a bounded linear functional in H1.

129
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,060
So if you define...

130
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:13,060
So L of V is not continuous

131
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,060
and bounded and continuous

132
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:18,060
for linear functional is the same

133
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,060
in L2,

134
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:22,060
but

135
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:26,060
is continuous

136
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:29,060
in H1.

137
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:32,060
Okay?

138
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:35,060
And the reason is that

139
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,060
all of these functions I constructed,

140
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,060
they are not...

141
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,060
So if you look at...

142
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,060
So first of all, they are not in H1, right?

143
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:47,060
Because they don't have bounded derivatives.

144
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,060
And even if you try to...

145
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:54,060
Okay, what if I construct a function that is continuous?

146
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:58,060
Instead of going from minus 1 to 1 in a sharp way,

147
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,060
we can go to minus 1 that way,

148
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,060
and I can shrink it, go like this.

149
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:06,060
But the problem is we have derivatives that is going larger and larger

150
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:11,060
when you make the spike going higher and higher.

151
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,060
Right?

152
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:17,060
So there is no way you can construct a...

153
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,060
construct a V

154
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:23,060
whose derivatives are still square integrable

155
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:29,060
while the value at 0 goes higher and higher.

156
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,060
Okay?

157
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:35,060
And the proof is a little bit time consuming,

158
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:40,060
but you can still get a sense of that by the following.

159
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,060
So first of all,

160
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,060
Lv is...

161
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:48,060
So the H1 norm of V

162
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:55,060
is the integral from minus 1 to 1 V square plus dV dx square, right?

163
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,060
dx.

164
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,060
Right?

165
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:01,060
So first of all, the V square term cannot be too large.

166
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,060
So V has to be...

167
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:07,060
The mean value of V cannot exceed, let's say, 1.

168
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,060
Right?

169
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,060
Okay.

170
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:13,060
The value of V is not going to be too large.

171
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,060
So if I...

172
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:18,060
So what I'm saying is if I have a V that is equal to...

173
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,060
The norm of V is equal to 1,

174
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:25,060
okay, I want to show that the value of Lv cannot be...

175
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,060
go to infinity.

176
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,060
Right? So, okay.

177
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:30,060
So if I have this to be 1, then the mean value of V,

178
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:33,060
so this term, has to be less or equal to 1.

179
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:36,060
And this term also has to be less or equal to 1.

180
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,060
And if this term is less or equal to 1,

181
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,060
then the slope cannot be too large.

182
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:43,060
So you have a function whose mean value cannot be too large

183
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,060
and slope cannot be too large.

184
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,060
So the point...

185
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:50,060
So the value of the function at 0 also cannot be too large.
