1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
So I'm going to show the Comfort Workflow via an example called a titanium

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,840
micro resistor actuator. This is not a blue flow related problem but it could

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:17,040
be. So imagine a bridge shaped beam that has two feet and then a bend. So basically

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,400
you apply it's a conductive material titanium. So when you apply a potential

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,740
bias across the two feet you're going to have current flow through it. And then

6
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,220
because of the current flowing then you're going to have resistive heating.

7
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,060
So the dual heating is going to generate heat and the entire structure is going to heat up.

8
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:37,080
So there is going to be a temperature gradient in the structure. Because there

9
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,920
is temperature gradient then it causes thermal stress. So this entire structure is

10
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,980
actually going to deform because of all that. So the problem definition here we

11
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:53,220
have the first physics which is the electric current simulation DC current

12
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:58,560
through conductive medium. And the second physics is the thermal conduction with

13
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,220
a dual heating element.

14
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,700
So the thermal conduction is going to be the heat source. So it's a purely conductive problem.

15
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:08,100
So the boundary condition we'll be setting will be will glue the two feet on a huge heat sink.

16
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:14,940
So the temperature remains unchanged to 93.15. And then for the rest of the surfaces we'll assume

17
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:18,780
they are adjacent to dry air so they actually subjected to conductive cooling.

18
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,640
And then the third physics is a solid mechanics problem with the thermal stress.

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,980
So to make the problem more interesting you can introduce the reverse coupling.

20
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:37,080
You can easily say through the temperature dependent material properties the electric conductivity is the function of the local temperature.

21
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,440
Alright so I'm going to start COMSOL.

22
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:45,720
Here it is.

23
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,040
And I'm going to start a new model.

24
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:55,000
So the two options you have on this first interface is you can either start with a blank model or start with a model wizard.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,860
So the model wizard is basically the first of few steps of the

26
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,380
in your model workspace.

27
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,840
So I select the Model Wizard, and now it

28
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,840
asks me to select what's the space dimension

29
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,040
I want to work with.

30
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,780
So of course, in a more theoretical class,

31
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,260
you would always start with a more simple situation,

32
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,840
like a 0D or 1D problem.

33
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,500
0D, you don't have to create a geometry.

34
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,220
1D, you just draw a line with a certain length.

35
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,360
And then the other options would be the 1D and 2D axis

36
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:22,920
symmetric.

37
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,220
So 1D axis symmetric is essentially

38
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,580
equivalent to a 2D circle surface.

39
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,280
And then the 2D axis symmetric is

40
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,940
equivalent to a 3D rotation symmetry way.

41
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,580
Both the physics plus the load and the boundary conditions

42
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,020
have to be, plus material properties,

43
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:42,700
have to be axis symmetric in order to qualify for that.

44
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,740
And then there is also the 2D and 3D options.

45
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,820
So right now, I'm going to choose a 3D.

46
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,740
It's a 3D actual beam.

47
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,760
And then I'm going to choose the first physics

48
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,160
I want to solve for, which is the electric currents, right

49
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,760
under the ACDC folder.

50
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,580
So here, the physics are grouped not by modules,

51
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,880
but by application areas.

52
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,480
So I'm going to choose Add.

53
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,900
There is a little specification on what is the interface

54
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,080
and what it does.

55
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,780
It's going to solve for a capital case V, the electric

56
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,660
potential.

57
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,880
And I can move to the study node.

58
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:17,540
In this case, I'll choose the simplest, the stationary,

59
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,280
as the solver type.

60
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,300
Click on Done.

61
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,360
So now the model, we are finished its task.

62
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,700
Now you're in the main console graphical user interface.

63
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,440
We call this the GUI.

64
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,460
So in the GUI, you see I'm using a Windows system.

65
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,540
So the screen now gets divided into a few parts.

66
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,900
If you use a Mac or a Linux, you'll

67
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:40,140
see a slightly variant of this interface.

68
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,220
Instead of this console ribbon, we

69
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,520
call the console ribbon and tabs on the very top,

70
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,280
you would have a console toolbar, so a slightly condensed

71
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,640
version of it.

72
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,780
And then basically, on the ribbon,

73
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,580
you have the different tabs that goes from definition

74
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,880
to geometry to material, physics, mesh, study,

75
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,380
and results.

76
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,380
So that's the workflow I'm talking about from left

77
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,480
to right.

78
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,380
And the same thing here.

79
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,940
In the model builder, you have an inverted tree structure

80
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,760
with a root on the top and branches and nodes after it.

81
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,140
There are a few options because we dictated that during the

82
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,540
model wizard step.

83
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,860
But essentially, you go from top to bottom of this tree.

84
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,060
You will go from definition, geometry, material, physics,

85
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,500
mesh, study, to results.

86
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,840
So that's the workflow, too, from top to bottom of the tree.

87
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,900
You can change the sequence in any part of the model.

88
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,820
It's just a general guideline that once you

89
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,320
have all the steps aligned, you'll

90
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,380
eventually have the results.

91
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,860
So all the options here are either

92
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,480
through the buttons on the ribbon

93
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,680
or through the right clicks on the model builder tree.

94
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,520
So all the options are through the right click.

95
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,240
So when you're in doubt, right click.

96
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,040
And in the middle, we have a settings window.

97
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,820
So when you click on a certain node in the model builder tree,

98
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,780
you have the corresponding settings for it.

99
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,700
And then in the right, we have a graphics window

100
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,480
with many buttons.

101
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,640
Now it's a 3D geometry, so it shows the 3D coordinate.

102
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,820
And in the very bottom, we have messages, progress,

103
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,820
and log.

104
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,360
So in this case, we're going to start

105
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,200
with building the geometry in console.

106
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,840
So I'm going to start with a work plane.

107
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,840
So work plane is right here.

108
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,700
You see there are some 3D primitives.

109
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:15,800
And if you import, there is some CAD-defeaturing tools.

110
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,140
And there is also the, I want to emphasize,

111
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,460
the virtual operations.

112
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,840
For those of you who have complicated CAD geometries,

113
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,060
those would come in very handy.

114
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,220
And then after I created a work plane,

115
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,280
I essentially added a work plane step

116
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,200
under my geometry sequence.

117
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,180
And under that work plane 1, now you

118
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,780
might see the settings of work plane 1.

119
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,460
So horizontal plane, which I actually

120
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:41,380
want to change it to a vertical plane, so xz plane.

121
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,280
So under work plane 1, I have a plane geometry.

122
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,120
When I click on it, I go into the 2D workspace.

123
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,200
I could use the draw line operation

124
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,680
to sketch the profile of the beam very quickly.

125
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:58,360
So I do a series of left clicks and then a right click.

126
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,980
It forms an enclosed surface.

127
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,600
You could change that surface into a closed curve or open

128
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,220
curve as well.

129
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,400
And you see that each of the points

130
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,600
that I click on, the coordinates,

131
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,920
are documented as a Bezel polygon

132
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,080
in the geometry sequence.

133
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,900
So everything you do is documented in that model

134
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,040
builder tree.

135
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,280
And you can change those coordinates if you need to.

136
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,600
So this is actually a microbeam.

137
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,680
So I'm going to go back to the geometry.

138
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,840
And I'm going to go back to the geometry node.

139
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,440
Before I forget, change the default length unit

140
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,360
from meter to micrometer.

141
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,360
So now I don't have to type the e to the minus 6.

142
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,920
So now I have a 2D geometry.

143
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,860
I can right click on work plane 1, add an extrude.

144
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,920
And I'm going to extrude it for about 0.2 micron.

145
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,240
That should be good.

146
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,440
So now I have a 3D geometry with a 0.2 micron as the thickness.

147
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,440
So now that's the geometry step.

148
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,980
I'm going to go back to the geometry node

149
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,400
and move to the next one, which is the materials node.

150
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,680
I can right click, choose the first one, add material.

151
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,440
And it's going to browse to the console material library.

152
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,680
I'm going to choose the building.

153
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,680
The building folder actually comes with the base package.

154
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,200
So you always have it.

155
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,520
I can right click on the titanium materials,

156
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:17,000
add it to component 1, and close the add material panel here.

157
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,800
So now titanium is added to my material list.

158
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,200
And automatically, it assigns the properties

159
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:22,940
that I have.

160
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,980
The first material I pick will be assigned to all the domains.

161
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,220
So right now, there is only one domain.

162
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,760
And now it's going to use two of the properties.

163
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,600
So those properties are what the physics calls for.

164
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,920
And that's because in the physics,

165
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,980
it's assigned to domain number 1.

166
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,040
And the material property says from material.

167
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,720
So that's how the geometry node, the material node,

168
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,000
and the physics node all tie together.

169
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,920
If the material pick actually doesn't have that information

170
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,720
necessary, you're going to get a stop sign right here.

171
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,180
And when it goes through the solver,

172
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,180
it's going to give you an error message saying,

173
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:58,680
mat.epsn is missing, or something similar to that.

174
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,700
So always check the material property.

175
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,120
And then the next node is the physics node.

176
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,060
So as I said, you always follow the same workflow,

177
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,860
no matter what kind of physics you work with.

178
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:13,620
So you'll see that essentially, the first physics I added

179
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,080
has three default nodes.

180
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,780
You can tell they are the default from the uppercase D

181
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,640
on the icon.

182
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,900
So the default governing equation,

183
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,220
you can tell from the shape of the icon, which

184
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,240
is a field cylinder.

185
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,800
That means it's on the domain level.

186
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,280
So if you see the equations very quickly here,

187
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:34,840
that is the Laplacian type of equation we want to solve for.

188
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,600
And that applies to everywhere in the domain.

189
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,260
If you right click on electric currents,

190
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,140
you see the other options here.

191
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,000
That's other than the current conservation,

192
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,940
you also have terminals, the domain, force calculation,

193
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,880
and then a list of boundary conditions.

194
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,180
So right now, the default boundary

195
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,900
conditions is electrically insulated everywhere.

196
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,460
So no current goes in or out.

197
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,440
And dot j equals to 0.

198
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,160
And the initial value, essentially

199
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,180
in a stationary problem, that's the initial gas that

200
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,160
is 0 potential everywhere.

201
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,780
So we're happy with comparing these equations

202
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:11,940
with the equations we wrote down on the slide.

203
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,480
We're happy with the governing equations,

204
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,100
but we do need to replace some of the boundary conditions.

205
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,080
So I can do that by right clicking

206
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,460
the electric current physics, add a ground condition.

207
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:24,460
And now I can choose that boundary I want to work with.

208
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:27,140
So the graphics window in COMSOL works with a three button

209
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:27,640
mouse.

210
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:31,800
You can left click, rotate the view, right click,

211
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,500
handle the view, click on the center scroll wheel

212
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,260
as if it's a button, move up and down, it'll zoom in or out.

213
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,640
So with the combination of that, you

214
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,380
can very easily navigate to any part of the geometry.

215
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,220
And you can always go back to the default view

216
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,360
with those default buttons here.

217
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,820
So in this case, the ground is going

218
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,560
to be applied to one of the feet.

219
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,300
So I'm going to rotate.

220
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,140
And basically expose the foot.

221
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,120
And then hover my mouse over, do a single click.

222
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,680
So now boundary number one is being selected

223
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,540
to satisfy the ground condition.

224
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,900
If there is actually a very complicated geometry

225
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,900
that some surfaces are hidden inside the domain,

226
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:13,000
you could use the transparency option or the wire rendering

227
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,840
to have the different visualization.

228
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,880
And you can hover your mouse over and then

229
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,740
use the center scroll wheel to rotate

230
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:21,040
through the different surfaces, the different layers

231
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,800
of the geometry to get to the inside layers.

232
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,160
So again, that makes the selection easy.

233
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,720
You can also, in the definitions,

234
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,280
define some selection lists.

235
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:35,420
Like everything within this certain ball shape

236
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,940
belongs to one group, and they'll

237
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,720
satisfy the same condition through the model,

238
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,060
through the entire model, something like that.

239
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,540
The other condition I need to change

240
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,980
is the electric potential condition on the other foot.

241
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,040
And that's going to be 0.2.

242
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,160
And now you can see that the other foot is going to be 0.2.

243
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:50,820
And now you can see that the other foot is going to be 0.2.

244
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,160
Now, if I go back to electrical insulation,

245
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,560
surface number 1 and 10 are both overridden.

246
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,380
So they no longer satisfy that n dot j equals to 0.

247
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:02,520
Instead, they satisfy the one with the red triangles that

248
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,100
basically tells you what's the correspondence

249
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,260
communications between the different nodes.

250
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,840
All right, so that's it for the physics.

251
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,940
Any questions for the physics?

252
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:16,000
Could you say more about the red triangle

253
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
and how it's about to reach there?

254
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,520
Yeah, so when you click on electrical insulation,

255
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,200
the ground and electric potential

256
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,700
has the upward red triangle, meaning

257
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:28,080
that this condition gets later on overridden by the other two

258
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,080
conditions.

259
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,900
When you click on the ground, it says

260
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,900
that the electrical insulation has actually

261
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,940
definition on some boundary conditions

262
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,580
on the same boundaries, and it's overridden by the ground.

263
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:41,640
So it means those two nodes are actually

264
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,820
defined on the same space, and which one dominates which one.

265
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,160
So in terms of a lot of places, the sequence does not matter.

266
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,360
For example, if you have 10 different physics,

267
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,140
how they are actually sequenced in that component one,

268
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,420
it doesn't matter.

269
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,140
The only thing matters between the physics

270
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,100
is how you have the communication between them,

271
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,920
what's the coupling that's happening between the physics.

272
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,120
But the sequence of the boundary conditions do matter,

273
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,740
especially if you duplicate boundaries.

274
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,180
Then the later defined conditions

275
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,940
will override the earlier defined ones.

276
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,400
Some of the boundary conditions can coexist.

277
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,220
For example, natural convection and radiation

278
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,860
can coexist on the same surface in heat transfer problems,

279
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,840
and some conditions are not coexisting.

280
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:19,920
So what's the difference?

281
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,520
So the later defined ones will be the one effective.
