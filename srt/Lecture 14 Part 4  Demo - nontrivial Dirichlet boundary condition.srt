1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
of non-trivial boundary conditions. Alright, so let's go back to our simpler case of

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:25,520
f equal to 1. So let's do this, which makes our right-hand side equal to 1. And let's use a

3
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:36,080
boundary condition that is x. So the solution u on the left-hand side, let's say, is equal to 1.

4
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:47,440
So what does that make a difference? So now if we have a solution u also equal to,

5
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,360
that is non-zero at the first grid point, what we have is we also have a u0 which is

6
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:02,480
non times phi0 of x. Let's say phi0 is the half-hat function that is equal to 1 at the left

7
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,000
boundary and equal to 0 at all the interior grid points. So what happens is that

8
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,080
because the test function, because the phij's, the v's are still going to be zero at the boundaries,

9
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,160
so the integration by parts still come out to be the same with no boundary terms. But

10
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:32,240
in addition, there is going to be a term that is minus integration of a and b,

11
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:44,560
which is very similar to this term but with a known u0 times partial phi0, partial x,

12
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:53,040
times partial phi1, not partial phi1, partial phij, partial x. And this is going to combine with

13
00:01:54,160 --> 00:02:01,920
the right-hand side into the bj. And last lecture we analyzed this term and say this term is only

14
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:12,400
non-zero for j equal to what? This is non-zero only for j equal to 1 because phi0 is only non-zero

15
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:19,440
in one of the intervals. Okay, so let's, and the value of this is the same as one of the terms in

16
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,800
aij, right? So,

17
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:33,360
so what we need to change is simply b1 is equal to b1 minus, well, this term itself is negative

18
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:42,000
because d phi0 dx is negative, d phi, j dx is going to be positive where j is equal to 1, so it's

19
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:50,560
a downward slope plus a upward slope. So minus and minus cancels, we get an addition here, so it's

20
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,120
going to be plus,

21
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:04,080
1 over x2 minus x1, right? So this is the additional term we have in the right-hand side

22
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:12,640
due to the boundary condition. So now we have, the a is not changed, so we have u is equal to a back

23
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:21,440
slash b, all right? And now let's plot the solution, close all, plot.

24
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,560
So let's plot the solution, close all, plot.

25
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:37,200
Our plot x, instead of 0u1 we have 1u0. Instead of 0u0 we have 1u0 because the left side is 1 now,

26
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,520
right? So let's plot this. This is our solution, still on a very irregular grid.

27
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:52,560
And let's see how good the solution is. The analytical form of the function is like this. So,

28
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,080
so by setting a left-hand side, we can plot the solution. So, so by setting a left-hand side,

29
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:12,080
one dash connect under all nodes is 1. By putting one dash with a math

30
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,760
feature between left and, and I put v1 in between the two dash,

31
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,360
and v1 can be equivalently legal by the sequence of the transform, the substitution.

32
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,200
What we get then is the semisués. Right? One dash and half 게 the sum.

33
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,420
All right? And now what we have is our solution, plus, and that's what we've been doing all very wrong to bring up here.

34
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:23,540
So at that point we can just tease this line for the time being. And this is what we're uh important everything lists for,

35
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:23,680
basically this is a base function, one, and one, and then we have a divisor of 2 nuclear Department, we have a B�� situational.

36
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,360
so it doesn't affect the second order derivative so we still satisfy the same

37
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:33,680
equation but with a non-trivial boundary condition and if you combine them of

38
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:46,360
course you get a 1 minus x times 1 plus half of x so my u-fine is equal to now

39
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:58,980
1 plus half of x-fine times this and let's hold on plot x-fine and u-fine

40
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:04,120
see the the blue line right now is the analytical solution and the black line

41
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:11,080
is the numerical solution again we match pretty well all right so so we covered

42
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,880
how to solve the Poisson's equation using finite element both with

43
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,320
a

44
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:16,340
solution and a solution. So now let's see how to solve the Poisson's equation using finite element both with a

45
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:21,060
constant right-hand side and with the non-trivial function as right-hand side

46
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:25,160
and also with non-zero boundary conditions
