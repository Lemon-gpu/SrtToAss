1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,180
I want to still make it more even more obvious that like do not use one of the

2
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:14,880
differential forms when you have shock waves okay so so we just compute the

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:23,580
speed of the shock wave to be essentially FL minus fu so this is FL is

4
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:33,180
f of ul fu is f of f if you are so this is ul minus you are right so so instead

5
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:38,000
of D F D U this is Delta F over Delta U

6
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:48,480
and so let's try it on the burgers equation we already know that on the

7
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,340
burgers equation

8
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:59,500
we have the speed of the shock wave being ul plus you are over 2 right so

9
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:07,880
that's what we derived but there is a contradiction here if we multiply both

10
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:17,580
sides of the equation by U and Monday and many manipulate using your calculus

11
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,420
skills we can get something pretty interesting

12
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,320
so let's try it again.

13
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:31,740
So first of all, the time derivative term, there is a classical trick that actually is

14
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,400
very useful in stability analysis, they call nonlinear stability analysis of differential

15
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:44,960
equations, that when you multiply u with du dt, it is actually equal to partial t of u

16
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,200
squared over 2.

17
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:56,560
So this is the same kind of chain rule we use to go back and forth between the differential,

18
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,840
between the primitive form and conservative form of the Berger's equation.

19
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:11,040
There is a similar trick you can use on the spatial derivative term.

20
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:20,180
u times du squared over dx squared is equal to something times du squared over dx squared.

21
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:25,060
du cubed over dx.

22
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,040
And that's something, let me derive it.

23
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:46,220
So du cubed dx is equal to the derivative of u times u squared over dx.

24
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,500
And now you expand it.

25
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,520
This is equal to u times dx.

26
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,720
And then you multiply that by the derivative of u times u squared over dx squared.

27
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:49,820
So you expand it.

28
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,020
You can do it once again.

29
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:50,060
And then we're going to do the same thing.

30
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:50,160
Now that we've done this exercise, we're going to do the same thing.

31
00:02:50,160 --> 00:03:06,800
u squared dx plus u squared times du dx and the same thing can be represented as

32
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:19,080
derivative of u times u times u which can be represented as u squared times du

33
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:29,960
dx times 3 right so you can move one of the u out move the you can move this u

34
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:35,620
you can move this times this out of the differential and you can move this and

35
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,980
this out of the differential and you can move this and this out of the

36
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:44,360
differential so that that like works like that so so the same so the same

37
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,880
thing is equal to 3 times this or it is

38
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:48,980
again enseÃ± statistik Geschichte und volume um gesehen um so if you can see

39
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:57,680
equal to this plus this. Okay so let me let me do a derivation. So u squared

40
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,480
times partial u partial x is going to be equal to one third of partial u cubed

41
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:09,920
partial x. And now we substitute this into that we get partial u cubed

42
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,920
partial x is equal to u times partial u squared partial x plus one third of

43
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:22,420
partial u cubed partial x which means u times partial u squared partial x is

44
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:34,580
equal to two-third of partial u cubed partial x. So this is going to be two

45
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:45,860
third. So this is the whole derivation of this. Right okay so with

46
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:45,900
this we can do the derivation. So we can do the derivation of this. So we can do the derivation of this. Right okay so with

47
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:53,300
this two substituted into this equation what we have and of course we have over

48
00:04:53,300 --> 00:05:01,420
two here so this is going to be a one-third if we divide by two here. So

49
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:10,380
this equation therefore becomes partial partial t of half u square plus partial

50
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:15,840
partial x of a third of u cubed equal to zero.

51
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,400
Right, so those two are one third of partial u squared partial x plus one and

52
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,000
that is u squared is equal to partial t over two. So we have to Pass more Kanad yes

53
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,220
but we have

54
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:27,140
so we have the S grilling out of the logic bag then the other side too this

55
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:32,180
is called parallel values and we given a slight one this S g going to be

56
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,340
partial t but yes also called partial t times partial t so the Brock equation

57
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:40,720
here in because there's a three times partial here so now we can see it and

58
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,980
that we decrease the mean by sin you oyster.

59
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,620
We actually want to be

60
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,520
You enidious know that bitch answer how to which far so understand when I'material

61
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,580
3 half power divided by 3.

62
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,140
Right?

63
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:00,100
So this is nothing but writing the same equation,

64
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,080
Berger's equation, into a different form

65
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:08,200
by doing a bunch of manipulations of the derivatives.

66
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:16,280
But with that alternative way of writing down the conservation law,

67
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,260
we have a different shock speed.

68
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:27,140
The shock speed in this case is going to be equal to delta FV over delta V.

69
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:34,080
So it's going to be equal to delta of this 2V,

70
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,360
3 over 2 over 3,

71
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,180
divided by 2V,

72
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,520
divided by delta V,

73
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:48,260
which is different from half of UL plus UR.

74
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:57,540
So these two only agree when UL and UR are infinitesimally close to each other,

75
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:01,280
and they don't agree over a finite range of UL and UR.

76
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,980
It's not obvious, but you can do the derivation and see that.

77
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,780
So what does that mean is,

78
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,000
what does that mean is,

79
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,100
all this derivation we did down here

80
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:27,380
only hold over an infinitesimal range UL and UR.

81
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,700
All the derivation we did only holds for the differential form of the equation.

82
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,160
It does not hold for the conservative form,

83
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,680
for the integral form of the equation.

84
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:41,260
So when you choose a discretization,

85
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,120
we can never base the discretization

86
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,880
on some differential manipulation.

87
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,580
For example, the Taylor series.

88
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:52,840
Right?

89
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:57,680
The Taylor series is a manipulation of the differential form of the equation.

90
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:02,660
And that is no longer a reliable way of

91
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:06,280
manipulating the differential equation into another form to solve it.

92
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:06,320
Right?

93
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:10,160
We should rely on something else.

94
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,640
And this lecture, I'm just going to show you what that something else is.
