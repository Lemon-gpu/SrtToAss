1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
What's remarkable is the same thing applies for PDs.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So remember, we have a differential operator discretized in both space and time.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So let's say this is going to be replacing my time derivative here.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
This is discretized using forward Euler.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And my right hand side is still the same.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Delta x squared.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And because it's forward Euler, this is u k.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:56,000
My right hand side is expressed as the differential operator operated on the known quantities.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Or the quantity at the previous time step.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
If it's backward Euler, the whole right hand side would be k plus 1.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So now, I'm going to apply the same Fourier transform but still only in space.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Because in time, we don't know if we can do that or not.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So we still...

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Only apply this in space.

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Oh, I think I messed up with my k.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So let me don't use k plus 1 here. Sorry.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Let's use something like m.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Oh, anyway.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So this is the stability region.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So let's use m.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Okay.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Once we use m, we can say that...

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:55,000
u m of i is equal to summation of k goes from minus n over 2 because of aliasing.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And I have u hat m of k.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Now this u hat is not a function of continuous time but a function of m, the discrete time steps.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
u to the j k i delta x.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Everything else is still the same.

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So when we plug this in,

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
the time derivative or the discrete time derivative is only applied to here.

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So after doing the same thing we did before, we get...

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
u hat of m k...

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:38,000
k m plus 1 minus u hat of m k divided by delta t is equal to kappa times...

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
my 2 cosine delta x minus k...

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Sorry.

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:53,000
k delta x minus 2 divided by delta x squared times u hat of m k.

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Alright.

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So now...

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Oh, sorry.

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
This is delta t, not delta x.

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So this comes from here.

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
This comes from here.

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Now, how can we analyze...

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Can somebody tell me?

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
In what cases is this equation stable?

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
In what cases is the space-time discretization stable?

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Right.

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
If you look at the previous one, we are doing pretty much the same thing, right?

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So...

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Except for we have something more complex over here.

50
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Okay.

51
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Somebody tell me how do I analyze the stability of this PDE now,

52
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
discrete in both space and time?

53
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Right.

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So this is the same as our lambda, right?

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So we want to analyze that...

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,000
We want to analyze 1 plus delta t times this kappa...

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
2 cosine k delta x minus 2 over delta x squared.

58
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
This thing has to be less than 1.

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Less than 1.

60
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Alright.

61
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
But what about the k here?

62
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
There is still...

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I cannot decide about this unless I know what k is.

64
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Right.

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So kappa is given.

66
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Kappa is from the differential equation.

67
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Right.

68
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
But k is something we invented by doing the Fourier series.

69
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So how do I deal with the k?

70
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yeah?

71
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So...

72
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
That's a good point.

73
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Choose the worst case k.

74
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Right.

75
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
That's what you are saying, right?

76
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So in other words, this condition has to be valid for all k.

77
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So for all k that goes from n over 2 minus n over 2, etc.

78
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
to n over 2 minus 1.

79
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Alright.

80
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So that's actually the difficult part

81
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
about making sure a...

82
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
partial differential equation is stable.

83
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
That is, you have a lot of different modes mixed in the Fourier series.

84
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Right.

85
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So if you have a...

86
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Let's say if you have an initial condition.

87
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The initial condition is usually not just containing a single Fourier mode.

88
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It usually...

89
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
If you use any function except for sine and cosine functions,

90
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
almost any other function contains all the Fourier modes.

91
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's just that the magnitude...

92
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's basically a linear composition of many Fourier modes.

93
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And as soon as one of your k is not stable,

94
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
that component is going to be exponentially magnified

95
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
and make your whole solution garbage.

96
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So in analyzing stability of partial differential equations,

97
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
you need to make sure that all the modes

98
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
that can exist in the solution are stable.

99
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Okay.

100
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And now let's figure out what this condition needs, actually.

101
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Okay.

102
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So let's copy what we had in the last slide.

103
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So delta t kappa delta x squared

104
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
to cosine delta x times k minus 2

105
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
has to be less than 1.

106
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And now let's try to plot them

107
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
as a function of...

108
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Um...

109
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Let's plot them as a function of k delta x.

110
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Okay.

111
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I remember...

112
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So let's plot this as a function of k delta x.

113
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And I think let's use this here.

114
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So this is...

115
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So let's just plot this

116
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
as this 2 cosine delta x k minus 2 here.

117
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And we know we need to multiply this thing by that.

118
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Right?

119
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So that's a constant.

120
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So let's define this constant c

121
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
as kappa delta t over delta x squared.

122
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And we're going to know later on

123
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
this number is called the so-called CFL number.

124
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So this...

125
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Ah...

126
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Move this to here.

127
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Okay.

128
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
So this function...

129
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Or this constant times this quantity plus 1

130
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
is going to be the decision...

131
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
deciding factor in the stability analysis.

132
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So let's look at what this is.

133
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And remember k delta x,

134
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:01,000
because delta x is equal to 2 pi over n,

135
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
and k goes from minus...

136
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
minus...

137
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
n over 2 to n over 2 minus 1.

138
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So the range of k delta x is bounded between minus pi and pi.

139
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Right?

140
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Okay.

141
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Now 2 of cosine minus 2.

142
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:30,000
A cosine of k delta x ranges from 1 to minus 1.

143
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So 2 times this minus 2...

144
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Or again, I can write it 2 times cosine minus 1.

145
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Is going to range from...

146
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Basically the maximum is going to be 0.

147
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
The minimum is going to be...

148
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
minus 4.

149
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Right?

150
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
So I'm going to have a function that looks like a cosine,

151
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
but goes like that.

152
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And at the bottom, this is minus 4.

153
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Which is equal to 2 times...

154
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
cosine of minus pi.

155
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
This is achieved when...

156
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
when k is equal to minus n over 2.

157
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Minus 1.

158
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Right?

159
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So cosine minus pi is minus 1.

160
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Another minus 1 minus 2 times 2.

161
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's minus 4.

162
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Alright?

163
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Now...

164
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Once I multiply a number...

165
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Once I multiply this number,

166
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
which can range from minus 4 to 0,

167
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
with the CFL number,

168
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
and add by 1,

169
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I want to make sure this number stays within the range of the circle.

170
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
The circle goes from minus 2 to 0.

171
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I mean, also...

172
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Also, this is always a real number, remember?

173
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So I want to make sure that the number lies within that range.

174
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Okay?

175
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
So I want to make sure this number,

176
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
which now I can write as 1 plus c,

177
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
times something that ranges from minus 4 to 0,

178
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
has to be less than 1.

179
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So, the less than...

180
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
So we're taking the absolute value here, right?

181
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
So that means, without the absolute value,

182
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
it has to be less than 1 and greater than minus 1.

183
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
The less than 1 part is automatically satisfied

184
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
because... as long as c is positive.

185
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Because the maximum of this number,

186
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
2 times cosine delta x k minus 2,

187
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
is going to be 0.

188
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:49,000
But the greater than minus 1 part is not going to be automatically satisfied.

189
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Because when this takes the value of minus 4,

190
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
my c has to be less than... what?

191
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
c has to be...

192
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
first, greater than 0,

193
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
and less than what?

194
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
For this to be greater than minus 1.

195
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It has to be less than half.

196
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Right?

197
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Make sense?

198
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
So, this is called the CFL condition.

199
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:35,000
The c and f and l is just the first letter in the last name

200
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
of three people who almost simultaneously discovered this law.

201
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Alright, the CFL condition is...

202
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Let me write this down.

203
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It's kappa times delta t over delta x squared

204
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,020
has to be less than 1.
