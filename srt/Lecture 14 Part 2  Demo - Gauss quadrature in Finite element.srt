1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,240
okay now our next demo is what if we have a function f that is not linear

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:15,660
okay remember if we have a function f that is not not a constant what we have

3
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:24,900
to do is to integrate this function within every interval right so so let's

4
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:38,280
give an example of if f is equal to let's say sine of pi x so sine of pi x

5
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,300
within 0 and 1 is going to be a sinusoidal function that goes up and

6
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:49,020
down and I constructed this such that we also are going to have an analytical

7
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,780
solution right we also going to have an analytical solution that is actually

8
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:54,880
unique to the problem so we're going to have an analytical solution that is actually

9
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:00,280
equal to sine of x times a coefficient because the second order derivative of

10
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:07,300
sine is actually minus pi square of sine right so we also have an analytical

11
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:14,380
solution and the BJ in this case is going to be split into two parts X X J

12
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:24,520
minus 1 so this is J to X J of a solution that goes from 0 to 1 which

13
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:24,760
means that we have a solution that is going to be a sinusoidal function that is

14
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,180
going to be a sinusoidal function that is going to be a sinusoidal function that is

15
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:32,080
out my X is going to be X minus X J minus 1 over X J minus X J minus 1 so

16
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:46,540
that's the form of the V J times sine of pi X DX plus X J to X J plus 1 and the

17
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:54,640
form of the function is going to be X minus X J over X J plus 1 minus X J on

18
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:01,840
also times sine of pi X DX so let's see how do we construct this function yes

19
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:16,780
5J oh yeah 5J is this hat functions right these are Phi 1 Phi 2 so each function is one over here

20
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:22,120
uh it is one at a particular grid point and zero at all other grid points it's piecewise constant

21
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,520
all right so this is

22
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,560
so this is our general equation of فn into f of jed and v .

23
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:43,680
In this particular equation we can even disease a sign coming out of a

24
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,640
illion point gV J into G and let's assume this is

25
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:54,420
the sign we set the function as a z wheels so we can use this for adding onion dice here

26
00:02:54,420 --> 00:03:06,680
So for example, on the first interval, we can compute we have x1, which is 0, and x2.

27
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,780
So let's use these two grid points.

28
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,360
So let's compute the Gauss quadrature points and weights within that interval.

29
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,440
The way to use this is x and w.

30
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:21,800
These are x is the location of the Gauss quadrature points, and w are the weights.

31
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:29,980
And first of all, we give an n, which is the number of quadrature points.

32
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,220
In this case, let's try a quadrature points of 5 points.

33
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,460
And a and b are the intervals, which we give it x1 and x2.

34
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,940
So it gives me the x and the weights.

35
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:51,120
So x, as you notice, are a set of numbers that lies within x1 and x2.

36
00:03:51,120 --> 00:04:03,820
So the maximum is 0.093, which is close to the right-hand side of the interval, but not quite.

37
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,140
The minimum is 0.046, which is close to 0, but not quite.

38
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,160
And the weights are a little bit larger in the middle than at the two ends.

39
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:20,820
So it's the spacing. The spacing is more sparse in the middle and more tight at the ends.

40
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,120
Alright.

41
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:33,160
So this can be used to compute the integral over the first interval.

42
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:40,500
So let's do this. Let's do x left, w left.

43
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:46,380
We are going to have a right pretty soon, because in order to compute the first entry of b,

44
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,580
we need to integrate over two intervals.

45
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,900
So we have the left.

46
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,660
So we have the left of both entries, and how do we approximate the integral?

47
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:02,900
Is the function we need to integrate this particular function at the grid points

48
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:12,120
times the weight corresponding to the grid point, and just sum over these five points.

49
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,080
So let's compute the number. Let's call it b of left.

50
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:18,700
Okay.

51
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,100
It's equal to

52
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,420
the grid point x left minus x of 1

53
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:31,620
divided by x i plus 1,

54
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,680
so in this case x2 minus x1.

55
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:39,920
This is the form of the basis function.

56
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,980
And times sine of pi times xl.

57
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,440
xl are the Gauss quadrature grid points.

58
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:54,020
And I multiply this value with the Gauss quadrature weights.

59
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:02,080
So these are going to give me five numbers.

60
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,620
If I sum over the five numbers,

61
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:12,600
this is going to give me the value of the function.

62
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,700
But the weights shouldn't be negative,

63
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,400
so I must give it...

64
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,500
Okay, so let me see.

65
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,040
So f of x is defined in a and b.

66
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,840
I simply evaluate it.

67
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,140
So what did I do?

68
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:45,120
I give it xa is x1 and b is x2.

69
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,400
So I must have...

70
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:56,320
I see.

71
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:56,940
Good point.

72
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:01,400
Okay, so I should have x equal to...

73
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,600
Okay, let's do this again.

74
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,240
Right, okay.

75
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,640
Now I have the original x.

76
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,500
I can do this.

77
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,500
So my weights are now positive.

78
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,400
And my xl is what I...

79
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,260
expect.

80
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,280
So now let's compute b left is equal to the same number.

81
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,960
This is the integral of the function I wanted to integrate in the first interval.

82
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,440
Okay, so I can also have...

83
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:37,440
my x right and w right being...

84
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:43,320
the Gauss quadrature points and weights in the second interval.

85
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,840
Okay, so this is my second interval.

86
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,280
And then I can also compute the right side of the quadrature.

87
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,440
Being summation of x right minus x2.

88
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,440
This is actually...

89
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,440
Wait.

90
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,440
It's xr.

91
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,440
I think I made a mistake in here.

92
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:11,440
What I needed actually is xi minus xi plus 1.

93
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,320
Because this basis function has to be zero at xi plus 1.

94
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:16,880
Right?

95
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,000
Okay.

96
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,320
Okay.

97
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,320
And there should be...

98
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,320
There also should be...

99
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,320
Should there be a minus sign?

100
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,320
Yeah, there should be a minus sign here.

101
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:29,320
So it's actually xi plus 1 minus x.

102
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:36,320
So this is going to give me a 1 at xj and give me a 0 at xj plus 1.

103
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,320
Right?

104
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,320
So it's a function that goes downwards.

105
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,320
Okay.

106
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,320
So now let's compute this function.

107
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,320
xr should be...

108
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,320
It should have x3 minus x1.

109
00:08:47,320 --> 00:09:01,320
So it's going to be x3 minus xr divided by x3 minus x2 times sine of pi times xr times the wr.

110
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,320
Okay.

111
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:10,320
So this is going to give me the right side of this b1.

112
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,320
Right?

113
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,320
So I can have a b1.

114
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,320
It's going to be equal to b left plus 1.

115
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,320
So this must be right.

116
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,320
Of course this only computes one entry.

117
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,320
So let's do a loop of computing all these entries.

118
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,320
So let's go for i goes from 1 to n minus 1.

119
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,320
Okay.

120
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:37,320
And so what I'm going to compute is b left.

121
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:43,320
b left is going to be...

122
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,320
Oh, sorry.

123
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,320
I need to first compute the question.

124
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,320
So I'm going to compute the quadrature weights.

125
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:55,320
The quadrature weights on the left is going to be in between i and i plus 1.

126
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,320
Right?

127
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:05,320
And my x right and w right should be the quadrature points between i plus 1 and i plus 2.

128
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,320
Right?

129
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,320
So this gives me the quadrature weights.

130
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,320
And my...

131
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,320
My integral on the left side of the...

132
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,320
The integral on the right side of the grid point should be...

133
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:28,320
The value of the basis function should be xl minus xi divided by xi plus 1 minus xi.

134
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:36,320
So this is the linear function that goes from 0 to 1 when x goes from xi to xi plus 1.

135
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,320
Times sine of pi times xl times wl.

136
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,320
So this is correct, I think.

137
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,320
Okay.

138
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:54,320
And br is going to be equal to the summation of x now i plus 2.

139
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,320
Right?

140
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:01,320
Because I'm looking at the interval on the right side of this grid point.

141
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:07,320
And I have xi plus 2 minus xi plus 1.

142
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,320
This is right.

143
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,320
And my bi would be equal to bl plus br.

144
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,320
All right.

145
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,320
Okay.

146
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,320
So now I have the complete b field.

147
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,320
Let's do it again.

148
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,320
u is equal to a inverse times b.

149
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,320
So now I get my u again.

150
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,320
Let's close my previous plot.

151
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,320
And plot this u again.

152
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,320
Hmm.

153
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,320
This time I got something wrong.

154
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,320
Okay.

155
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,320
Got something that is not as good.

156
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,320
So let's plot my analytical solution again.

157
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:56,320
My u, phi, instead of equal to the quadratic.

158
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:07,320
We have sine of x, phi times pi divided by pi squared.

159
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,320
Okay.

160
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,320
And let's hold on.

161
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,320
And plot my analytical solution.

162
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,320
Let's see how they match.

163
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,320
Okay.

164
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,320
So I don't really get what I expected.

165
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:23,320
Can we find a bug in the code I have in the for loop?

166
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,320
Oh, yes.

167
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,320
I changed my x vector.

168
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,320
I need to redo the a matrix.

169
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,320
Yeah.

170
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,320
Thank you.

171
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,320
So let's do this.

172
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,320
My diagonal term is equal to the integral of x.

173
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,320
So I can do this.

174
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,320
So I can do this.

175
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,320
So I can do this.

176
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,320
So I can do this.

177
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,320
So I can do this.

178
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,320
So I can do this.

179
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,320
So I can do this.

180
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,320
So I can do this.

181
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,320
So I can do this.

182
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,320
So I can do this.

183
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,320
So I can do this.

184
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,320
So I can do this.

185
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,320
So I can do this.

186
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,320
So I can do this.

187
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,320
So I can do this.

188
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,320
So I can do this.

189
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,320
Okay, together.

190
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,320
So we have x equals i, plus my diagonal terms and a equals a.

191
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,560
So let's, let's this first, a is equal to a, plus my diagonal terms and a is equal to

192
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:57,440
a minus, no, I don't have these two times.

193
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,440
Ok.

194
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,440
So that's my new a matrix.

195
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,500
Yeah.

196
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,820
Ok.

197
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,760
Thanks.

198
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,760
So, let's do this again.

199
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,760
And ...

200
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,260
Um.

201
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:26,160
these and these are still correct this is the correct main diagonal right so we

202
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,940
get a matrix that yeah looks looks like half the properties we expect all right

203
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:40,700
so u is equal to a backslash B and let's try to plot this time solution

204
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:48,680
let's plot it as what color let's plot it as a black okay so now the black line

205
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:53,180
matches the analytical solution a lot better right so let's let's close this

206
00:13:53,180 --> 00:14:01,620
again and so this is numerical solution this is

207
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:01,680
you

208
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:08,780
analytical solution sorry let me hold on and plot the numerical solution again so

209
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:15,560
now my numerical solution matches the analytical solution a lot better so we

210
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:20,100
have demonstrated how to use finite element to solve the Poisson's equation

211
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:25,180
with zero boundary conditions both for trivial right-hand side and for a

212
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:29,540
non-trivial right-hand side all right and Gauss quadrature with five points

213
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,580
seems to be very good already

214
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:50,360
finally these are the bombs ok here you add any

215
00:14:50,640 --> 00:15:01,660
aggravating
