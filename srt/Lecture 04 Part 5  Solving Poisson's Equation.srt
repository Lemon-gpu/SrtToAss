1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Now we have the matrix and given a right hand side we can solve the equation for U.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So let's just try it. What kind of right hand side would you like to try?

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Anybody give a suggestion?

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
A sinusoidal one.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:39,000
A sinusoidal one? Okay, so you want F to be...

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Sine of what?

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Huh?

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
X times Y? So we don't have any X or Y yet. So let's do this. Let's construct the X and Y.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So, is mesh grid in 2D?

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Yeah, okay, so let's look at... I think mesh grid is what can help you to construct X and Y.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It returns a 2D grid coordinate based on vectors X and Y.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So, okay, so let's say X is equal to 1 to NX minus 1 times DX.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Y is equal to 1 to NY minus 1.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Come on, minus 1 times DX.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Okay.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And I think that's it. I think just do big X and big Y equal to mesh grid X and Y.

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So let's see if I get the right thing.

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Big X is going to be a 31 by 31 matrix.

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So...

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's actually the opposite of what I wanted to get.

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So I want... So this is the first index. I want the first index to correspond to the X direction.

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I want the second index to correspond to the Y direction.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So...

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So let me just switch them over. I will just do Y and X.

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Alright?

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So this index corresponds to the X direction. This corresponds to the Y direction.

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That's what we had in this indexing, right?

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So the first index corresponds to incrementing X.

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The second index corresponds to incrementing Y.

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So if you look at Y, it's the other way. It's going this way.

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Alright?

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So...

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I think you wanted F equal to sine X times cosine Y or something.

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Alright?

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So we get an F that is 31 by 31.

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:01,000
How do you convert the 31 to 31 matrix into this?

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Huh?

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So if you do mat to vac...

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Is it...

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yeah, I think reshape is the same as reshape.

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Yeah.

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Yeah.

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Yeah.

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I think it's the best approach.

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,000
But like, in order to reshape it to into the format of what we want, because MATLAB does it the other way, right?

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So we need to do...

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
We need to reshape it of...

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Let's actually make big F equal to sine X times cosine Y.

49
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So that big F is a matrix.

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So we need to do small F equal to reshape of F transpose into NX minus 1 times NY minus 1.

51
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And 1.

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Alright.

53
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So let's see.

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Huh.

55
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Actually, I don't think I can see much from that.

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Okay.

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So let's say sine of X times cosine of Y.

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So in the beginning...

59
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
In the beginning of the matrix...

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Of the vector, I should have R equal to 1, right?

61
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So I should have R equal to 1 and J increases.

62
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So I should have a very small number because it's sine of a very small X times a slowly decaying number.

63
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So let's see if that's what I get.

64
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Okay.

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I think that's right.

66
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Right?

67
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So this is like sine of delta X times cosine of delta X, cosine of 2 delta X, cosine of 3 delta X, etc.

68
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Alright?

69
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So from the ICE inspection, it looks right.

70
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
We can also create a surface plot of big F.

71
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Let's do X, Y, and F.

72
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So that's what my F looks like.

73
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So we can do X label X, Y label Y.

74
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
That'll give me...

75
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So this is X, this is Y, and the Z axis is of course my F.

76
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Alright?

77
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So I think it's the right trend.

78
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
X increases, sine function increases, and cosine function decreases.

79
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So now I have my small F.

80
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Let's do U is equal to matrix backslash F.

81
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I get my U.

82
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Alright?

83
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
How do I visualize my U?

84
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I get my U, which is a 961 by 1 array.

85
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So I need to reshape it back to...

86
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
a matrix before I can visualize it.

87
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So let's say my big U is equal to reshape of small u.

88
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And again, MATLAB, we need to do...

89
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
We need to make it...

90
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
NY minus 1 first.

91
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And X minus 1.

92
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Transpose.

93
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Alright.

94
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So when we reshape that way, we transpose first, and then reshape it.

95
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
In the reverse...

96
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
In the inverse operation, we need to reshape it into the transposed shape of F.

97
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And then transpose it back.

98
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So let's do the same serve, but now with U.

99
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
That's what my solution looks like.

100
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Okay?

101
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
The Laplacian of this U is equal to F.

102
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So the Laplacian, which means the X...

103
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
The second order derivative of X plus the second order derivative of Y.

104
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's some kind of curvature in 2D.

105
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And the positive Laplacian curves in a convex way.

106
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So curves...

107
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
This is what a positive Laplacian looks like.

108
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And if you rotate it a little bit...

109
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Let's maximize and rotate it a little bit.

110
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You should also be able to see that...

111
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
The curvature is larger towards this side.

112
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Right?

113
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Towards the...

114
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Towards the X equal to 1, Y equal to 0 side.

115
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So let's do X label, Y label.

116
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So X equal to 1, Y equal to 0 side.

117
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You see, like the...

118
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
The bottom of this function shifts...

119
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's not in the center.

120
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It shifts towards the X equal to 1, Y equal to 0 side.

121
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
That's because the curvature is larger in this side.

122
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And if you...

123
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
If you...

124
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:26,000
If you remember the figure we used to look at Y...

125
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So this is what Y looks like.

126
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It's largest over here.

127
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
This is what...

128
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Ooh.

129
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
What did I do?

130
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Uh...

131
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I think I...

132
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
All right.

133
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Okay.

134
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So if you look at this figure, it's...

135
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
The curvature is largest over...

136
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Over here.

137
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
All right.

138
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So this...

139
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:54,000
We completed the loop of solving a Poisson's equation in 2D.

140
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
And that gives us a solution like that.
