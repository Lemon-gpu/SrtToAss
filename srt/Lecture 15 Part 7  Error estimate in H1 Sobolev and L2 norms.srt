1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,160
Let's now start talking about what if I'm not happy with just the energy norm?

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,040
What if I want a more general norm?

3
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:19,260
How can I say that the finite element solution, how good is the finite element solution in some other norm?

4
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:28,700
It turns out in some other norm I can no longer say that, so for example, if I look at the H1 norm, so u minus uh.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,040
I can no longer say that this is optimal.

6
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:47,040
In fact, this is not going to be optimal in all possible finite dimensional, in all possible members of the finite dimensional space.

7
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,520
But I can bound this.

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:59,840
I can bound this to be some number times u minus wh.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:09,280
For all possible wh's in this finite dimensional space.

10
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,060
So I can do that by the following.

11
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:20,440
So first of all, let's define what is u minus uh in the H1 norm.

12
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:28,640
So u minus uh in the H1 norm is the summation of two parts.

13
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:29,640
Right?

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:45,060
One is the integration of u minus uh squared plus the derivative of u minus uh squared dx.

15
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,000
No, no, I actually don't need that because I can just start.

16
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,860
I don't need to use the Poincare inequality again.

17
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:59,860
I can just start by saying that.

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,780
The energy norm is coercive.

19
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,680
The bilinear form is coercive.

20
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:16,940
So what I can say is that u minus uh in the H1 norm squared is less or equal to 1 over b times the energy norm.

21
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:27,160
And we know that the energy norm is the energy norm is the minimizer.

22
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,980
So this is less or equal to 1 over b of u.

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,520
So we can just write u minus wh.

24
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,360
u minus wh.

25
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:38,940
For all the possible wh's in xh.

26
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:47,360
And also, let's use the continuity of this bilinear form here.

27
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:59,980
So by continuity, this is less than c times the norm of u minus uh squared.

28
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,680
And also, this is less than c times the norm of u minus wh.

29
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:10,560
So the error in H1 norm is not exactly minimized.

30
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,380
But it is close to minimum in a certain sense.

31
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:28,700
It is close to minimum in that the error is not going to be greater than a certain finite constant times the minimum error you can achieve.

32
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,480
So the error in H1 norm is not going to be greater than a certain finite constant times the minimum error you can achieve.

33
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:29,980
So the error in H2 norm is not going to be greater than a certain finite constant times the minimum error you can achieve.

34
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:30,480
So the error in H2 norm is not going to be greater than a certain finite constant times the minimum error you can achieve.

35
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:30,980
Right?

36
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:45,980
So because this can be for any wh, the same inequality also is true for the wh that minimizes the norm.

37
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:53,580
So it is less than this times the infinimum or the minimum of wh in xh.

38
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,460
u minus wh.

39
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:08,240
Okay, now with that, we can start looking at what rate of convergence do we have.

40
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:17,240
So infinite difference, we can analyze the order of accuracy of the differential operator.

41
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:17,740
Right?

42
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:24,540
So if we use a central difference to approximate a first order derivative, we know the error goes down like delta x squared.

43
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,980
So if we use a central difference to approximate a first order derivative, we know the error goes down like delta x squared.

44
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:28,540
If you use a forward difference, you can see that the error goes down like delta x squared.

45
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:33,540
If you use a forward difference or backward difference, we know the error goes down only with delta x.

46
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:40,540
So here we can do the same analysis here, infinite element, once we have that inequality.

47
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:44,540
Because this inequality holds for any wh.

48
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:51,540
So we can easily construct a delta h, construct a wh for which we know the order of accuracy.

49
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:57,540
And we know that the same order of accuracy is going to apply for the same order of accuracy.

50
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,540
And we know that the same order of accuracy is going to apply for the same order of accuracy.

51
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,520
And we do that even if you are only sure that the

52
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:12,520
And this is because if you look at the c and b here, the c and b here are the properties of this a, of this bilinear form, right?

53
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:20,520
It has nothing to do with h, it has nothing to do with what kind of approximation we are making.

54
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:25,520
It has nothing to do with the specific x-h, right?

55
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,520
So, if we can construct a w, which is anyway a deeper string, minus a one culture, which is anyway a developer code,

56
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:39,680
So that also means as we refine the mesh, as we refine the mesh, which also makes the XH to be richer and richer,

57
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:45,360
has more and more approximation power, the C over B is not going to change.

58
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:52,100
Okay, that allows us to build specific WHs.

59
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:57,620
For example, what the WHs we are using here is an interpolant.

60
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:02,260
So let's say we have a U, so that is the green one is U.

61
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:12,500
And we have a finite element mesh over here that restricts our approximation UH to be piecewise linear functions.

62
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:19,040
So why don't we construct WHs that actually goes through these grid points.

63
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:25,260
So this is going to be our WH.

64
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,380
So WH.

65
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:33,420
Is just connecting the dots on the function.

66
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:38,380
Of course, the WH is in the space, right?

67
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,580
We are trying to approximate.

68
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:49,540
And so let's start to analyze what is the, what is this approximation error in H1?

69
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,600
So the approximation error in H1.

70
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,920
So let's, let's call this WH.

71
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,620
Uh, this is particular.

72
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:02,340
Let's call the interpolant of U.

73
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,980
So I begot interpolant.

74
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:08,260
It's with the H because it's on the particular mesh.

75
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:13,140
So let's figure out what is this U minus interpolant?

76
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,420
What is this approximation error?

77
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,060
Of course, it has two terms.

78
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:28,420
It has one term that is the L2 error of the interpolant.

79
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:39,220
And also another term that is the L2 error of the derivative of the interpolant.

80
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:43,220
So let's figure out these two terms one by one.

81
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:50,340
And the point here is to see how does this error decrease as my refine my mesh.

82
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:57,820
If I know, for example, the error decreases like delta X square as a refined mesh.

83
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:06,580
Then I know that the U minus UH is also going to decrease like delta X square as a refined mesh.

84
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:14,500
Because this, this C over B doesn't change as I refine the mesh.

85
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:15,140
Right.

86
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:16,340
Okay.

87
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:22,420
So, so, so here we go back to Taylor series analysis.

88
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,420
So we look at first, we need to analyze how big.

89
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:35,340
Is this approximately how, what is the maximum difference between the red line and the green line?

90
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:41,020
So let's first look at the maximum difference between the derivatives.

91
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:46,340
And in order to do that, I need to use.

92
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:55,460
So, so first of all, the derivative of the interpolant over a interval is going to be constant, right?

93
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,380
It's going to be.

94
00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:00,100
You add grid point.

95
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,300
I plus one minus you.

96
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:06,300
I divided by X I plus one minus X I.

97
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:13,300
So that's the slope of these curve over that interval over the element.

98
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:24,300
Now what we need to do is we need to use what's called the mean value theorem.

99
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:24,580
Okay.

100
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:24,700
So.

101
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:24,860
So.

102
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:24,900
So.

103
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:24,980
So.

104
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:25,100
So.

105
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:25,140
So.

106
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:25,180
So.

107
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:25,220
So.

108
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:25,340
So.

109
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:25,380
So.

110
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:25,420
So.

111
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:25,500
So.

112
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:25,540
So.

113
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:25,580
So.

114
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:25,620
So.

115
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:25,740
So.

116
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:25,780
So.

117
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:25,820
So.

118
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:25,860
So.

119
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:25,900
So.

120
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:25,980
So.

121
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:26,980
So.

122
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,300
So.

123
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:27,380
So.

124
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:27,700
So.

125
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:27,740
So.

126
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,180
So.

127
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:28,220
So.

128
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:28,260
So.

129
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:28,340
So.

130
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:28,580
So.

131
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:28,620
So.

132
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,580
is how the mark equals a point.

133
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:36,660
Of course, if you have.

134
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:41,900
If you have some slight depression.

135
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:51,260
Then I think we can let Dimidex out and find the maximum on thecity level here.

136
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,220
Dad with no problem.

137
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:55,100
Thank you guys.

138
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:55,400
Yeah.

139
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:55,820
Thank you.

140
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:04,620
here. The proof is pretty simple. So if all the du, dx's are above that value, then you cannot

141
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:10,240
average to this value. If all the du, dx's below that value, you cannot also average to that value,

142
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:18,220
right? So that means you have to have a certain point du, dx's greater or equal, another point

143
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:23,980
du, dx's less or equal. And because du, dx's a continuous function, so you have to have some

144
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:33,700
point where du, dx's is exactly equal to this value, where xi is somewhere between xi and xi plus 1.

145
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:46,900
All right. So now we have this. Then du, dx's at any point in eta, that is within the space,

146
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:52,580
now has to equal to du, dx's at xi

147
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,900
plus xi.

148
00:10:53,980 --> 00:11:04,600
So last Taylor series analysis again is going to be the second order derivative of u to x

149
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:15,080
times eta minus xi. Well, this is at xi plus o eta minus xi squared.

150
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,820
And this whole term I claim is order

151
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,960
delta x or order x.

152
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:33,900
So let's say h is the maximum where h is the maximum of xi plus 1 minus xi.

153
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:42,880
All right. So this is order h because eta and xi are both in the interval xi and xi plus 1.

154
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,880
So the difference between eta and xi has to be o h.

155
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,320
All right. Any questions so far?

156
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:52,340
All right.

157
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:53,960
So we are done with this.

158
00:11:53,960 --> 00:12:06,960
We already know that the derivative term in the Sobolev norm has to be order h.

159
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:13,100
And it turns out the same thing happens for the value.

160
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,920
The value is actually a lot easier.

161
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,920
So u minus...

162
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,420
u minus...

163
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:21,920
u minus...

164
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,920
u minus...

165
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,460
u minus...

166
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:23,760
u minus...

167
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:23,800
u minus...

168
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:23,880
u minus...

169
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:23,940
u minus...

170
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,020
u minus...

171
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:24,120
u minus...

172
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:24,220
u minus...

173
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:24,300
u minus...

174
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:24,320
u minus...

175
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:24,420
u minus...

176
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:24,520
u minus...

177
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:24,540
u minus...

178
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:48,440
the interpolant of u at a particular xi is going to be the integral of the difference from xi to xi of du dx minus dih u dx dx.

179
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,500
Right.

180
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,760
We already know this term is o h.

181
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,220
We already know this term is o h.

182
00:12:55,220 --> 00:13:01,800
So this whole thing because xi minus xi is also o h.

183
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,400
So this guy is o h squared.

184
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:11,480
So the Sobolev norm of u minus interpolant of u.

185
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,400
Square.

186
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:15,800
Well.

187
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,220
It's going to be equal to...

188
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:32,520
integration of u minus ih of u squared and this term before square is oh h

189
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:43,080
square plus d dx of u minus interpolant of u squared and this thing before I

190
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:50,440
square is oh so this is whole thing should be oh so after I square this is

191
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:59,500
all h square this is all h force so this is oh h squared and what I know is that

192
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:07,680
you minus my finite element solution is less or equal to C over B times u minus

193
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:14,200
any wh and in this case I just substitute the wh with this

194
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:20,200
interpolant and so it is going to be less or equal

195
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:20,400
to

196
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:30,820
oh h square so that gives us a bond on this Sobolev norm and of course the

197
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:37,380
bond on L2 norm is even is once we have the Sobolev norm the bonding L2 norm is

198
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:48,400
pretty easy so the L2 norm is basically the L2 norm is one component of this H1

199
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,200
norm right so it is

200
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:57,960
also so if I square it is also oh squared and
