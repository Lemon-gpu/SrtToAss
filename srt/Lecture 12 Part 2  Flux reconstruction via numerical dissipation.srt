1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,600
If we do flux reconstruction by numerical dissipation, that is, if we have a finite volume scheme, we have multiple u's or a single u's. It's going to be equivalent. We have i minus 1, i and i plus 1 as cell averages.

2
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:45,700
And we want to compute the flux at i plus half. The flux at i plus half can simply be the average of the flux applied on u i plus the flux applied on u i plus 1.

3
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:52,580
We know if we just do that, we tried that, the central flux scheme, it gives us parable results.

4
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,400
Once we create a shockwave, it basically blows up.

5
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:11,260
And we did a stability analysis to show that this scheme conserves the third power of the solution u, and therefore it never allows the shockwave to dissipate the solution.

6
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:21,940
But if we add something on top of it, if we add something on top of it, that is,

7
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:35,300
proportional to delta x, first of all, and that is, and multiplied by the characteristics, which is df du.

8
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:47,280
And here we should be using a sufficient dissipation that is as big as the maximum absolute value of df du within the range u i and u i plus 1.

9
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,300
So let me just say a max of df du times a flux.

10
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:59,460
First of all, the derivative of u, which is u i plus 1 minus u i divided by delta x.

11
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:04,660
So why am I taking the first order derivative here?

12
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:18,880
Because when you plug in this term in a finite volume discretization, remember a finite volume discretization, we have du i dt.

13
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:31,200
So we can say that the derivative of u i plus 1 minus u i minus 1 is equal to f of i minus 1 minus f i minus half minus f i plus half divided by delta t.

14
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:41,560
And that is going to give us, first of all, a term corresponding to a central difference in the flux.

15
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:47,520
So u of i plus 1 minus f of u i minus 1.

16
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,760
So this is the first term.

17
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:56,260
And the second term is going to give us plus delta x here cancels with delta x here.

18
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,960
And there is one more delta x here.

19
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:04,920
So what we get is a term that is proportional to u i plus 1.

20
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,460
So this is the i plus half part minus u i.

21
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:16,080
But there is another contribution of u i from the i minus half part plus u i minus 1.

22
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,040
Times...

23
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:23,020
Times the df du.

24
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:23,280
Right?

25
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:42,060
So by adding a flux that is proportional to the first order derivative of u, we are essentially adding a second order derivative in the right-hand side of this equation.

26
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,020
So here, another way to think about this is...

27
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,020
If...

28
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:53,320
We want to use finite volume scheme to discretize a second order spatial derivative,

29
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:59,440
we should be adding a first order derivative in the flux function.

30
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:06,040
And in this case, we want to, in order to achieve the same upwinding effect,

31
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:13,940
here is that, without knowing which side the characteristics comes from,

32
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,480
we want to add a numerical dissipation.

33
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,840
That is proportional to delta x times the second order derivative of x.

34
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:31,880
Therefore, in the flux, we add a term that is proportional to the first order derivative of u to x times the grid size.

35
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,760
It's a very good question.

36
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,900
This term is supposed to be delta x squared.

37
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,800
Yes, if...

38
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,180
If we want to discretize the second order derivative, it should be delta x squared.

39
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:46,640
But in this case, we want to multiply another delta x here.

40
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,320
Because...

41
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:55,820
If you remember, the additional dissipation term is proportional to delta x.

42
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,620
So what we want to discretize is delta x times the second order derivative.

43
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,040
Which means over here, it is okay to have divided by delta x.

44
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:05,760
Right.

45
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:07,180
Yes?

46
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:12,400
Going back to the previous page where you were just showing why we use delta x.

47
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,100
The last green line.

48
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,180
Where...

49
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,820
Where did that arise?

50
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,420
Where did that arise?

51
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:25,940
So that arises in the Taylor series analysis of ui minus 1.

52
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,460
So let me write it over here.

53
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:46,860
So ui minus 1 is equal to ui minus partial u partial x times delta x plus half of delta x squared partial squared u partial x squared.

54
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,020
Right.

55
00:05:48,020 --> 00:06:04,180
So if we do that and plug this ui minus 1 into this equation, because we're dividing by delta x, we get this term out.

56
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,300
So this term is going to be here.

57
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,640
And we also have this term, which we have delta x squared divided by delta x.

58
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,140
So we have a term that is proportional to the second order derivative.

59
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:22,420
derivative. So I think I'm missing a half over here. So half is going to be added to

60
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:31,880
delta x. And so if that's the case, I'm probably also missing a half over here. So the appropriate

61
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:40,880
amount of numerical dissipation is half of delta x times the characteristic speed. So

62
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:47,600
here I would also have half of that times the characteristic speed. So the question

63
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:54,040
is why don't we apply upwinding to the linear combinations of variables that has just a

64
00:06:54,040 --> 00:07:01,760
single characteristic. The reason that is difficult is because this linear combination

65
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:09,140
changes in time. So for example, if we have a shock wave, then at the next time step,

66
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,600
even at the same grid point,

67
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:10,700
the

68
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:10,860
shock

69
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:16,900
wave may have sweeped over the grid point. And therefore, before the time step and after

70
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:21,640
the time step, the particular linear combination, which depends on the matrix, which depends

71
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:28,000
on the solution, can change dramatically. So the particular linear combination you can

72
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:35,480
compute before that time step may become no longer the appropriate linear combination

73
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:40,680
to use for that characteristic after the time step.

That's right. That's right.

if a Retruckeresto a linear function?

80
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,480
why is it important to take the maximum DFTU?

81
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:20,440
This is because, again, of the entropy condition.

82
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,320
So remember, the entropy condition says that

83
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:28,980
no characteristics can emerge from a discontinuity, right?

84
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:36,740
And in this case, because we had a count example

85
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:41,320
that doesn't satisfy the entropy condition in the Berger's equation.

86
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:49,980
So if we have an inverted shock wave where on the left u is equal to minus 1,

87
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,300
on the right u is equal to plus 1.

88
00:08:53,220 --> 00:09:01,340
What happens is that the flux on both left and right of the shock wave

89
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,620
is going to be the same.

90
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,320
So that is going to prevent DUT.

91
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,280
DUT to change.

92
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:14,740
That is, prevent u to change by this difference in the flux alone.

93
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:20,280
What's going to, in this scheme, in this scheme,

94
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:24,840
what is enforcing the entropy condition to be satisfied

95
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,480
is actually this numerical dissipation here.

96
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,280
And the numerical dissipation here,

97
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,580
we need to take the maximum DFTU here

98
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,720
in order for the numerical dissipation,

99
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,420
to be sufficiently strong to satisfy the entropy condition.

100
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,900
All right, so for example, the grid point here

101
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,780
is going to be pulled downwards.

102
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,040
The grid point here is going to be pulled upwards

103
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,740
by this numerical dissipation.

104
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,740
Does that answer your question?

105
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:55,200
Yes.

106
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,300
So in a system of conservation loss,

107
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,420
we can apply the same scheme.

108
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,180
We can compute the flux as the average

109
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,700
between the flux on the left and the flux on the right.

110
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:13,480
Plus a delta x times the maximum of the absolute values

111
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,140
of different characteristic speeds.

112
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,260
For a shallow water equation,

113
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:25,960
this maximum DFTU would be the absolute value of u plus square root of gh.

114
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:32,280
So this term, times u plus 1 minus ui,

115
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,200
is going to be added.

116
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:42,380
So this is the dissipation flux that you want to add

117
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,480
to your central average flux

118
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,040
to get the appropriate solution.
