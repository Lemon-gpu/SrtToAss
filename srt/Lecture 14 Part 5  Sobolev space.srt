1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,880
So first of all, we need to define the so-called Sobolev space.

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:09,120
So the Sobolev space is an extension of the L2 space.

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:19,040
And if you did functional analysis, you know like L2 space is all functions whose square is integrable.

4
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:24,000
So it's all the functions where the integration between...

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,880
So usually you define an interval, right, in between A and B.

6
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:32,440
So let's say actually omega because this actually extends to multiple dimensions.

7
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:40,760
So integration over omega of f squared dx is bounded, so less than infinity.

8
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:47,380
So this is a class of functions that defines a space because...

9
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,880
defines a linear space because if f and g...

10
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:57,560
So first of all, if f is in L2 space, if you scale it by a finite number,

11
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,480
the scaled function is also going to be in the same space

12
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,960
because the integral of a square is just going to be also scaled by a constant.

13
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,440
Also, if you have f and g within both within L2,

14
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:16,000
then integration of f plus g squared dx,

15
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:24,660
we have f squared plus 2fg plus g squared dx.

16
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:26,120
Okay.

17
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,440
And using...

18
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,800
Using Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,

19
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:35,880
the integration of fg dx is less or equal to...

20
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:44,040
Well, half of integration of f squared plus g squared, right, dx.

21
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,820
And therefore, this...

22
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,740
If the integration of f squared is finite,

23
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,560
integration of g squared is finite,

24
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:55,640
then the integration of this and this and this are all finite.

25
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,640
Therefore, this is going to be...

26
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,600
Less than...

27
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:06,260
This is going to be less than infinity if f and g both are square integrable.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,760
So this is basically a proof that shows that the L2 space is a linear space.

29
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,440
Satisfying the criterion.

30
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,660
So if f is in...

31
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:27,420
So let's say if f and g both in L2 space,

32
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:34,160
then af plus bg is also in the same space.

33
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,600
Because scaling doesn't change...

34
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,640
I mean, scaling a member in the space cannot go out of the...

35
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,140
Cannot cause the member to go out of the space.

36
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,160
And also linear combination cannot...

37
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,900
Summation cannot force the member to go out of the space.

38
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:53,960
Right?

39
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,860
So the Sobolev space is an extension of this.

40
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:02,840
So the Sobolev space, we're only going to be talking about h1 here.

41
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:10,940
And the extension to h2, etc., we can see later,

42
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:15,280
is that all the functions f, such that the integral...

43
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,840
I'm also going to define omega here.

44
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,760
The integral of not only f, but also the derivative of f.

45
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,060
So let me just call it gradient of f.

46
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:27,840
It's fine.

47
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,000
It's finite.

48
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,860
In one dimension, this gradient is just the df dx.

49
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,780
So this is basically because both f squared and the gradient f squared,

50
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,400
they are positive.

51
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,720
The sum of these is less than infinity,

52
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:43,880
which basically means that the f is square integrable,

53
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,840
and the derivative of f is also square integrable.

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,180
Right?

55
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,860
So this is the equivalent to f...

56
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,860
Well, f integrable is...

57
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:02,380
It's the same as saying f is in L2.

58
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,300
And the gradient of f is also in L2.

59
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:16,520
So is it a bigger space than L2 or a smaller space than L2?

60
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:26,100
It's smaller because some functions in h1 doesn't belong to L2.

61
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:26,620
Right?

62
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,340
All functions in L2...

63
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,620
Sorry, the opposite.

64
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,180
All functions in h1 belongs to L2,

65
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,780
and some functions in L2 doesn't belong to h1.

66
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,920
Somebody think of an example of a function in L2 doesn't belong to h1?

67
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,460
A function that is in L2, but the gradient is not in L2.

68
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,240
Something on the vertical line?

69
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,340
Something on the vertical line?

70
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:57,400
Something on the vertical line?

71
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,100
Like, so you have a...

72
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,240
Okay.

73
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,180
Something that has a vertical line.

74
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,540
Something that has a vertical line.

75
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:06,760
Okay.

76
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,520
So a function like that.

77
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,040
Right?

78
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,960
So that's a very good example.

79
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,700
So it's a...

80
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,220
We have a function that is discontinuous.

81
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:15,560
Right?

82
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,700
So a function that is discontinuous belongs to L2,

83
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,080
but doesn't belong to h1.

84
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:21,980
Right?

85
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,860
That's a good point.

86
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,860
So discontinuous...

87
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,400
function...

88
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,480
can belong to L2, but not h1.

89
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,880
Another example is f equal to square root of x

90
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,320
for x in 0 and 1.

91
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,720
Of course, the function is square integrable.

92
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,860
Square is just x.

93
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,300
Right?

94
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,000
But the derivative is 1 over square root of x.

95
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,840
I mean, half of 1 over square root of x.

96
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,400
Square root, you get 1 over x,

97
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,760
and it's not integrable within 0 and 1.

98
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,360
I mean, the derivative is infinite at 0.

99
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,320
All right.

100
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:04,340
Okay.

101
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:12,580
So both of these are in L2, but not h1.

102
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,440
And we can define all other h's,

103
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,340
like h2 is f's,

104
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:25,660
whose square, the function itself,

105
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,340
and...

106
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,300
and also, like, the squares...

107
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:37,560
the second order derivative also has to be finite.

108
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,640
So now it's an even smaller space.

109
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:41,320
Right?

110
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,520
So as you increase this index,

111
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,760
more and more derivatives are required to be

112
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,120
not only exist, but also square integrable.

113
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,340
So you get more...

114
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,960
smaller and smaller space.

115
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,440
And this is...

116
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,120
the...

117
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,520
and also it's...

118
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,260
it's more than just differentiable, right?

119
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,400
Because square root of x, for example,

120
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,720
it's actually c infinity.

121
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:06,260
It's...

122
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:06,640
it's...

123
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,240
it's going to be differentiable always.

124
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,580
But, like, it's...

125
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,020
it doesn't even belong to h1.

126
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,520
So...

127
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,020
so...

128
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,220
so functions that are not just differentiable,

129
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,220
but its derivative are...

130
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:23,960
cannot go to infinity too fast at the boundaries.

131
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,220
Okay.
