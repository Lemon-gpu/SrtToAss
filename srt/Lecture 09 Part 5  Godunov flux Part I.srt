1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,860
The way to satisfy the entropy condition is a contribution by a person called Godunov.

2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:14,480
So he first constructed a numerical way to calculate the flux,

3
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,240
which is a modification to the upwind flux

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,860
that guarantees that the solution satisfies the entropy condition.

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,800
So what is his solution?

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,840
His solution, it's still, remember like in the upwind scheme,

7
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,860
we are thinking of approximating the solution as piecewise constant.

8
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,860
Here we still do the same.

9
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:44,800
So here we are explicitly considering that we are storing the solution averages,

10
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:49,460
but then we are reconstructing the solution as piecewise constants.

11
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,760
So let's say this is our numerical solution.

12
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,760
Okay, so this is my...

13
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,460
domain, this is my u, and this is delta x,

14
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:06,820
2 delta x, etc. So in between every two grid points, the solution is a constant.

15
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,560
Of course, that's a first-order approximation, right? So we are going to get a first-order scheme.

16
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,740
But like this is going to get us at least a

17
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:21,700
entropy satisfying solution, and then we can talk about later how to extend that to second order and higher order.

18
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,480
So with that piecewise constant approximation,

19
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:34,340
we want to compute the flux at every interface.

20
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,760
Now,

21
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,000
computing the flux is an interesting question because

22
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,740
previously, we are considering that if this whole thing

23
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,040
stays as a shockwave,

24
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,880
what is going to be the flux?

25
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,380
Right?

26
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:05,480
So we have been using upwind, and to determine which side is upwind, we are using the speed of a shockwave,

27
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:13,460
which implicitly assumes that this discontinuity is going to stay as a discontinuity after some time.

28
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,800
In reality, we just looked at it is no longer the case,

29
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:25,220
right? In some cases, this discontinuity is going to be no longer discontinuity,

30
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,620
almost immediately after you start evolving in time.

31
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,580
So, good enough insights is really from that.

32
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,120
It's really

33
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,840
analyzing for each, every interface, analyzing

34
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,200
is that discontinuity going to be, if you solve the equation exactly,

35
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:54,080
for infinitesimal amount of time, is that discontinuity still going to be a discontinuity after a while, after this infinitesimal amount of time?

36
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,180
And then,

37
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,680
after that analysis, you should be figuring out,

38
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:03,060
after this infinitesimal amount of time, what is the flux over there?

39
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,480
I'm just going to give you an example of the same

40
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:14,920
thing we did before. So that is, if we have two cells, one cell being minus one, the other cell being plus one,

41
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,560
okay, and the cell interface lies over here.

42
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,140
According to the upwind flux,

43
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:31,520
the speed is equal to zero. So it's okay to either choose the flux on the right or flux at the left.

44
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:36,440
Either way, the flux is going to be half of u squared, which is equal to half.

45
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,380
But, use good enough insight.

46
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,920
What is going to be the flux at this point after an infinitesimal amount of time?

47
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,560
Think of that.

48
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:58,740
What is the shape of the function after an infinitesimal amount of time, if you are solving the equation exactly?

49
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:05,380
So you should, after infinitesimal amount of time, you should have an infinitesimal range of solutions

50
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:11,820
between minus one and one that goes linearly. That's right. Now, what is the flux at

51
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,700
the interface

52
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,700
after infinitesimal amount of time?

53
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,900
Zero!

54
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,020
That's right. Why is it zero? Because the value of the function,

55
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,680
at this point, is going to become zero very soon, right?

56
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,860
It'll stay zero for a while.

57
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:38,800
And so the correct way to say the flux at this particular interface is the flux is equal to zero, not half.

58
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:45,860
It's not, you shouldn't choose either the left side flux nor the right side flux. It is zero.

59
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,480
Zero is the right flux to choose at this point.

60
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,000
So, of course, this is a special case.

61
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:57,100
What is the Moore general case? The Moore general case is exactly thinking like that.

62
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,620
If you solve, if you

63
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,140
analytically solve the differential equation

64
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:08,620
in a very tiny region around the discontinuity for a very tiny amount of time,

65
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:17,280
what is going to be the flux value? What is going to be the solution value at that discontinuity, at that, or not discontinuity, at this

66
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:22,780
location where the discontinuity is at t equal to zero, but maybe not

67
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:28,320
after a small amount of time. And then figure out the flux of that u value.

68
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,060
Right?

69
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,320
There are many different cases.

70
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:41,340
For example, if I have a discontinuity originally like that, and it has advected towards the right,

71
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,660
I become like this.

72
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:50,440
Then I should choose f of u left as my flux, right?

73
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,700
If I have the flux towards the right, I become like this. I should choose f of u left as my flux. Right?

74
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:52,800
If I have the flux towards the right, I become like this. Then I should choose f of u left as my flux. Right?

75
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,820
if I have a discontinuity like this,

76
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,300
and after a while it stays as a discontinuity

77
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,040
but advected towards the left,

78
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:09,100
then my correct f at this point is f of u right.

79
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,920
Do we agree?

80
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,100
Okay.

81
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,180
And there are other cases if originally I have a discontinuity.

82
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,220
I mean, we always originally have a discontinuity

83
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,280
if we approximate the solution as piecewise constant.

84
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,700
But later on, it becomes no longer a discontinuity.

85
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,780
Let's say it goes like this.

86
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,240
So it no longer becomes a discontinuity,

87
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,800
but it goes towards the left or towards the right.

88
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,520
I still should be having f of u right.

89
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,820
And if I originally have a discontinuity

90
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:46,000
and it becomes no longer a discontinuity

91
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,160
but advects towards the right,

92
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,200
I still want to use f.

93
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,220
So I choose f of u left.

94
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:57,180
And the very last case is I have a discontinuity in the beginning

95
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,180
and the discontinuity becomes like that.

96
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:05,180
While the right hand side of the solution goes towards the right,

97
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,580
the left side of the solution goes towards the left.

98
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:11,700
Then I should choose f of u,

99
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:15,700
the particular value of u that stays stationary.

100
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,620
Okay.

101
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,120
Do we see all these cases?

102
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:20,860
Yes?

103
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:25,440
The final case is when the left and right are equal but opposite sides.

104
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:31,600
The last case is when the left and right have different characteristic speeds

105
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,660
and they go towards different directions.

106
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,020
They don't have to have equal value.

107
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:41,920
The minus 1, 1 case is a special example.

108
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,600
But even if you have minus 2, 1,

109
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,500
you're still going to have the same problem.

110
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,060
You still compute the wrong flux

111
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,180
if you just use r.1.

112
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,960
So the first case is the discontinuity.

113
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,460
The discontinuity crosses the horizontal axis.

114
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,900
Oh, yeah, okay.

115
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,900
So for Burke's equation, that's right.

116
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,900
For Burke's equation,

117
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:06,900
because my characteristic speed df is equal to u,

118
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,220
yeah, that's right,

119
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,540
it only changes sign when u changes sign.

120
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:15,540
So for Burke's equation, this would only happen if

121
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:19,920
the value of the solution is positive on i plus 2.

122
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:24,380
So we just let u choose here to get the solution of way back from wherever

123
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,820
which is fta where the one-eighth?

124
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:27,420
We get 2, 2, 2x.

125
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:35,240
And the solution, i, 0x

126
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:43,160
equals feet at in a want and

127
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,960
it can't just satisfied when it's sorry.

128
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,080
Well, that's true.

129
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,920
But this is not wholly true.

130
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:49,940
No, that's not true.

131
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:57,620
It should go from negative to positive as u increases, right?

132
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:02,980
Yeah, that's right.

133
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:14,520
So df du has to go from, let's say 0, from negative to positive, which means f has a

134
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:24,260
watt over here, has a local maximum over here, right?

135
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:32,820
So if you look at f, it has a local maximum over here, and the value we choose to evaluate

136
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:42,260
in this particular u is actually the maximum of f, is the local maximum of f at this location.

137
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,260
Do you get it?

138
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,260
Like, this is actually...

139
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:44,360
Okay.

140
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:55,300
So this is max of f for u that is greater than ul and less than ur.
