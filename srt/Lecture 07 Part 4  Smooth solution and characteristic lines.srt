1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
So let's first analyze the behavior of the conservation law equation on the

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,960
smooth region. So if you think of back over here, over this previous

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,600
solution, we want to analyze the behavior of this equation on somewhere other than

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:26,560
this discontinuity, like over this region for example, how does it behave. And if

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:36,080
you take a look at the contour in space and time, let's magnify it a little bit,

6
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:41,920
can somebody describe to me how the solution behaves? Is there something

7
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,820
special you see on the spacetime plot? Yeah there is a discontinuity, let's talk

8
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,380
about this later. Right now we are talking about smooth part of the

9
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:54,180
solution, that's right. Did you see something special on the smooth part of

10
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,520
the solution?

11
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:56,540
What did you see?

12
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:08,140
A lot of what? Dispersion? I'm just, don't interpret it yet. It's leaning

13
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:14,260
inwards. Yeah what else, what do you see on this plot other than colors?

14
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:19,840
A bunch of lines, right? A bunch of not just the regular lines, a bunch of

15
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,520
straight lines. Does it occur to you as non-obvious

16
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:33,600
that the contour of a function should be straight lines? If you draw an arbitrary

17
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,960
function of space and time, you would expect I get curved contours. It's not

18
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,400
common to see functions in two dimensions with straight lines being

19
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:51,780
contours, right? So why do we get straight lines? I mean that's actually not the

20
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,480
case when you hit discontinuity. For example, over here,

21
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,760
we don't get a straight line. We get a line that actually turns, right? Two things

22
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:07,320
hitting to each other and it turns. But on the smooth portion, you see all straight

23
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:15,660
lines, so why do we see straight lines and what are these lines? That's a great point.

24
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:22,240
So you already did the analysis I want you to do. So that analysis is from the differential

25
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,480
form of the equation, right? So if you go back to the differential form of the

26
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:37,440
equation partial u partial t plus df du times partial u partial x equal to zero okay and we

27
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:46,880
said this is the wave speed and if f is only a function of u then df du is only a function of u

28
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:55,740
that means the speed at which the wave propagates they are just a function of u

29
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:04,520
so as the wave propagates at for example towards the right the because if i'm if i'm riding along

30
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:11,260
the wave then locally the solution value u doesn't change and therefore the speed doesn't change

31
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:20,480
intuitively that's the answer right mathematically let's do a little bit a little bit of analysis

32
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,740
so so if we look at the differential equation

33
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,240
okay

34
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,460
okay

35
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:35,740
what what we can do is we can write the solution u at a particular x plus

36
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:48,220
plus or minus x plus yes x plus uh df so let's let's just do this x plus a ct so let's look at

37
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:56,000
a function along the the value of the solution along a straight line

38
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:20,640
on the xt plot

39
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,000
only x more than on the right distance to be the slope of dx dt

40
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,640
okay

41
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,340
so the derivative so now because i wrote u as a function of not x plus ct so x plus ct

42
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,380
x plus ct is x, and also t.

43
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,100
So this is x, this is t.

44
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,340
Does it make sense what I'm doing?

45
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,700
I'm looking at a function of the solution along a line.

46
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:42,440
So basically, if I make x a dependent variable of t,

47
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:49,460
then I reduced u into a single-variate, univariate function instead of bivariate function.

48
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,440
x plus, I think.

49
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:59,320
So basically, let me use x0 to be a distinguishing from this x.

50
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,200
So this is x0, this is t equal to 0.

51
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:07,920
So as t increases, x is going to increase by c times t.

52
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:18,020
So this function, if we fix x0, is just a function of t.

53
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,120
So let's look at what is du of x0 plus ct.

54
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,220
t dt.

55
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,320
Again, we are using chain rule.

56
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:41,320
So this is equal to partial u, partial t times dx0 plus ct dt plus partial u.

57
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,100
Oh, sorry, this is partial x, right?

58
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,360
I am differentiating towards the first variable.

59
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,320
Partial u, partial t times 1.

60
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,060
So this is dt dt.

61
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,700
And what is this?

62
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,320
What is the first term?

63
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,440
It's just c, right?

64
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:06,100
So this whole thing is equal to c times partial u, partial x plus partial u, partial t.

65
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,220
Now, let's go back to the original differential equation.

66
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,020
According to the original differential equation,

67
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:16,900
this whole term is equal to 0 when c is equal to what?

68
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,000
If c is equal to df du,

69
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,520
this whole thing is going to be equal to 0.

70
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,780
So there is a chain reaction here.

71
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:45,260
So if I choose c to be equal to df du at x equal to x0 and t equal to 0,

72
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:52,100
then I know that the time derivative of u along that line is going to be 0.

73
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:57,660
Which means along that line, my u is going to be constant.

74
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:02,660
My u is going to be constant tells me that c is going to be constant.

75
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:07,100
So that means I can go along straight into that line

76
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,600
and expect my solution to hold constant, not changing at all.

77
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,340
All right, does it make sense?

78
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:18,140
And that is why we see a lot of straight lines on this contour.

79
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,380
A contour is a line on which the value,

80
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,380
the value of a solution holds constant.

81
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:30,120
And these contours are characterized by these lines,

82
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,440
x equal to x0 plus c.

83
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,940
So, okay, so this line is,

84
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:40,040
you can either write x equal to x0 plus ct,

85
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,880
or you can write it as x minus ct equal to constant.

86
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,280
Either way is fine.

87
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,580
I think maybe you are thinking about this, right?

88
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,080
So,

89
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,380
if x minus ct is a constant,

90
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,380
that also represents that straight line.

91
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,380
All right, okay.

92
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,380
So now, another question is,

93
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,880
how does the slope of the line depend on the local solution?

94
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,880
The slope of the line is the inverse of df du, right?

95
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:15,380
So if I have a df du locally equal to 0, for example,

96
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,380
what kind of line should I get?

97
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,380
I get a vertical line, exactly.

98
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,880
If df du is equal to 0, c is equal to 0.

99
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,380
I get a vertical line.

100
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,380
What if df du is negative?

101
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:29,380
I get a line that is tilted towards your left, right?

102
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,380
If df du is positive,

103
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,380
I get a line that tilts towards your right.

104
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,380
And again, let's look at the Berger's equation

105
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,880
to see how does my df du depend on u.

106
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,380
So Berger's equation,

107
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:45,380
if f of u is equal to u squared over 2,

108
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,380
df du is equal to u,

109
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,380
then,

110
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,380
u less than 0, c is equal to 0.

111
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:57,380
I get negatively sloping contours.

112
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:00,380
u equal to 0, I get vertical contours.

113
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:04,380
u greater than 0, I get rightward tilting contours.

114
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,380
Let's look at this to see if that's the case.

115
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,380
Right, so,

116
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,380
so,

117
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:12,380
when u is positive, the color is u,

118
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,380
I get right sloping contours.

119
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:17,380
When u is negative, I get left sloping contours.

120
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,380
And when u is almost 0,

121
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,380
towards here and here,

122
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,380
I get vertical contours.

123
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,380
And the more negative I get,

124
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,380
the more leftward sloping I get.

125
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,380
The more positive I get,

126
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,380
the more right sloping I get.

127
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,380
So that's

128
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:35,380
the contours we call characteristic lines.

129
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,380
So these are

130
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,380
the characteristic lines of my solution.

131
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,380
x equal to any x naught

132
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:46,380
times df du locally,

133
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,380
df du plus t,

134
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,380
uh, not, not this one,

135
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,380
this way, the other way, I think.

136
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:59,380
x plus df du times t

137
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:02,380
are called

138
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:05,380
characteristics.

139
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,380
Alright.

140
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,380
So, so, when we solve

141
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,380
nonlinear conservation laws using any numerical methods,

142
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,380
we should expect to see these

143
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,380
characteristics.
