1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
So now this lecture will assume you have made the wise choice of a stable scheme.

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,580
Then the error, the truncation error, now actually matters.

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,760
And most times when you use a code that somebody else wrote,

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:23,360
hopefully they are wise enough to choose a stable scheme, so you get reasonable numbers.

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:31,780
And then it's up to you, to the user of the code, to figure out is the solution accurate enough,

6
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,260
or what kind of error is in the solution.

7
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:40,220
And that's something we'll talk about in the beginning of this lecture today.

8
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:48,980
So the concept we are going to discuss today is called modified equations.

9
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:53,340
It is based on the fact that when you,

10
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,060
you discretize a differential equation using a numerical scheme.

11
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,840
The numerical scheme turns out to be, maybe it is a fairly good approximation

12
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,780
to the differential equation you want to solve.

13
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:14,260
But most of the time, it is actually an even more accurate discretization

14
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:19,000
of some differential equation that maybe you didn't want to solve.

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,200
And that equation, the scheme is actually,

16
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,680
actually approximating even better is called the modified equation.

17
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,380
For example, let's start with the pretty obvious example.

18
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:40,080
Okay, let's start with the differential equation du dt plus a constant capital U.

19
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,080
So capital U is a constant,

20
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:46,960
small u is a function, a solution of the PDE equal to zero.

21
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,260
And we all, up to now, we should all know what the solution to this equation looks like.

22
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,760
Right? What does the solution to this equation look like?

23
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,680
So let's say U, let's just say U is greater than zero.

24
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,800
What does the solution look like?

25
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,540
It's a translation towards which direction?

26
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,040
To the right, exactly.

27
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,480
Okay, so it's a pure translation to the right.

28
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,300
The solution should maintain its original shape.

29
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:23,120
So let's say if I have a periodic domain, the solution should maintain its shape forever.

30
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,120
Forever, right?

31
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:31,720
But in practice, let us discretize this differential equation using

32
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:38,520
one of the more stable schemes we discussed in the last lecture.

33
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,360
A scheme that would even be stable using forward Euler.

34
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,980
What is that scheme we ended up deriving?

35
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,140
du dt plus U times what?

36
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,120
Backward.

37
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,120
Backward difference, or upwinding, right?

38
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,240
In this case, the solution adverts towards the right.

39
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,880
The upwinding direction is towards where the wind comes from.

40
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,740
That's towards the left.

41
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:11,360
So towards the left, that involves U and U .

42
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,720
Right? U is towards the left.

43
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,640
So minus divided by delta x, you do Taylor series analysis.

44
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,400
That is the appropriate discretization.

45
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,300
That is first order accurate.

46
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:22,660
Okay.

47
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,020
Okay.

48
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,120
Okay.

49
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,120
Okay.

50
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,300
So that is equal to zero.

51
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:31,380
And if you did that in your class, that would be great.

52
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,960
But if you didn't, let's...

53
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,340
If you did it in your project, that's great.

54
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,080
If you didn't, let's code up a scheme like that and figure out...

55
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:46,280
And let's take a look at the solution to see how the discretization modifies the behavior

56
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,060
of the equation.

57
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,120
So let's say du dt, upwind.

58
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,120
Okay.

59
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,120
Okay.

60
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,120
Okay.

61
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,120
Okay.

62
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,120
This is T and U.

63
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,120
So we are...

64
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:04,120
Let's still use od45 to integrate this equation to make sure the time derivative doesn't really...

65
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:10,640
So, so od45 has a lot more accurate time derivative than the spatial discretization we are using.

66
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,640
Right?

67
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:19,400
So, so let's use od45 to try to remove a lot of the time discretization error and focus

68
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,120
on spatial discretization.

69
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,120
Okay.

70
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:28,900
So u is periodic, and let's assume u is in the domain of 0 to 2 pi.

71
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,300
The first u is at grid point 0.

72
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:39,340
The last u is at grid point 2 pi minus delta x.

73
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:45,140
Because the solution at 2 pi is actually exactly equal to the solution at 0,

74
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,140
so we don't have to remember that.

75
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:57,080
But so n is equal to the length of u, and dx is equal to 2 pi divided by n.

76
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:01,700
So n grid points, in this case, periodic domain, n grid points, n intervals.

77
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,340
Because we didn't store the solution at the very end.

78
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:17,120
So du dx is equal to two things.

79
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,160
Because we are looking at towards the left,

80
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,700
and the very first grid point when we are looking towards the left

81
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,340
is actually the very last grid point.

82
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:35,240
So the first grid point is u n minus u 1 divided by delta x.

83
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,520
So that's the very first grid point.

84
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:47,120
And the rest, I can write it as u of 2 to n minus u of 1.

85
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,080
So u n minus u 1 divided by delta x.

86
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:59,040
So this is a kind of, we call a vectorized way of coding

87
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:04,100
that works very well in MATLAB or Python or any of the interpreted language.

88
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,680
If you're coding Julia, you don't have to do that.

89
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,540
It's still fast.

90
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,880
But if you have MATLAB or Python,

91
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,900
vectorizing a calculation like this,

92
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,880
instead of going over a function,

93
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,120
instead of going over a function,

94
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,760
instead of going over a for loop,

95
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,300
is going to be a lot faster than going over the for loop.

96
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:28,360
So this is basically looping for i goes from 2 to n.

97
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,040
This is u i.

98
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,600
This is u i minus 1.

99
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:32,420
Right?

100
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,360
Yes?

101
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:38,940
Yes.

102
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,300
The first line should be u 1 minus u n.

103
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:41,820
Thank you.

104
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:43,720
All right.

105
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,100
So yeah, u i minus u i minus 1.

106
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,940
Yeah, u i minus 1 is actually u n in this case.

107
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:51,740
Okay.

108
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,480
So my du dt is then equal to,

109
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,080
according to this formula,

110
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,820
minus big U times,

111
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,960
let's put,

112
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,280
let's, for example, say,

113
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,860
okay, u is equal to 1.

114
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:06,820
Just to,

115
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,540
just to serve as an example,

116
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,580
minus u times du dx.

117
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,140
All right.

118
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,920
So that is our function.

119
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,960
And let's use od 45 to integrate that.

120
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:29,760
And so, for example, let's say x is equal to 1 to,

121
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,660
so that's 0 to 99.

122
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,560
For example, let's use 100 points divided by 100.

123
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,980
So that is our x.

124
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,760
We should multiply by 2 pi.

125
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:45,180
Right?

126
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,520
So, so that is our x.

127
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,520
And the way we start,

128
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,200
what kind of function do we want to start?

129
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,400
Let's just start with,

130
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,440
with a bump, right?

131
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,260
Let's start with a bump and see how the bump evolves.

132
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,300
And u 0 is,

133
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,820
I mean, a good way to,

134
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,340
an easy way to make a bump

135
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:11,260
is to take a sine function.

136
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,260
So sine of,

137
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:17,020
sine of x over 2.

138
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,300
So x goes from 0 to pi.

139
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,580
So, so x, x goes from 0 to 2 pi.

140
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,000
So x over 2 goes from 0 to pi.

141
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,480
So a sine bump.

142
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:33,620
Let's take it to the 16th power.

143
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,420
Okay.

144
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,540
So if you plot x and u 0, you see like a bump.

145
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,340
That's also a periodic function.

146
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:41,960
All right.

147
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:43,540
Okay.

148
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,120
So now we have our initial condition.

149
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,740
Let's say t and u is equal to,

150
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,760
oh, by the way, let me ask you,

151
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,460
if I want the analytic solution to advect over the entire domain

152
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,380
and come back to exactly the same location

153
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,900
so that the analytical solution is going to look like

154
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,760
the same as this one,

155
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,200
how much time should I integrate the solution for?

156
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,660
The length of the domain over u, right?

157
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,620
So length of the domain, u is like,

158
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,460
length per time.

159
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,580
So u is 1.

160
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,900
The length of the domain is 2 pi.

161
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,640
So I want to integrate by 2 pi.

162
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:24,560
Okay.

163
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:31,480
So tu is equal to od 45 of at dudt upwind.

164
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,020
What's the second parameter?

165
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:35,860
Is it time?

166
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,480
0 to pi.

167
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,180
And my u 0.

168
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:44,040
So that is da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

169
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm not consistent.

170
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,100
I think again, I have this.

171
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:54,700
I should be doing this instead of that.

172
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:55,960
Okay.

173
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:02,540
So I think it's probably because u is a vertically oriented factor.

174
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,580
So let's do that again.

175
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:06,480
Now we have a u.

176
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,620
So u, od 45,

177
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,820
obviously determined that this interval is too big as a timestamp.

178
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,040
So it automatically divided this interval from 0 to 2.

179
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,880
It evened out the interval.

180
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,320
And算 out that kilogram.

181
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,780
And the less the less we keep on doing attempts till the end

182
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,440
when it actually comes to the end,

183
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,920
we get this dash output

184
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,420
of which u, 0, and Entscheidung function f,

185
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,220
so f k's objective being equal to z.

186
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,820
And the third case is we to knowing,

187
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,920
in this case,

188
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,480
What do you call x-axis sum into a ?

189
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,040
That's the one.

190
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,420
That's the first case.

191
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,240
But then again,

192
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,000
since the YouTubers just go through the steps,

193
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,580
what else does this have?

194
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:51,100
That's our numerical solution after this thing

195
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,920
at x over one period.

196
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,280
Analytical solution again should be exactly the same

197
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,560
as the blue one.

198
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,680
Numerical solution, the red one.

199
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,980
Can somebody tell me like, what's,

200
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,380
what do you, can you describe,

201
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,980
qualitatively describe the difference

202
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,320
between the analytical solution which is blue

203
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,220
and numerical solution which is red?

204
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:17,220
It diffused out.

205
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,000
It diffused out.

206
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,360
It's almost as if we are solving not the advection equation

207
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,820
but an advection, diffusion equation, exactly.
