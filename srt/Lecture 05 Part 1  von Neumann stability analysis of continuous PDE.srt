00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
How to analyze stability. So last time we touched a little bit on how to do

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:12,400
stability analysis looking at the norm of a matrix. Today we'll learn the

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:18,280
most powerful method of doing stability analysis for PDEs. It's called the

4
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:25,120
von Neumann stability analysis. I'm gonna start with a very simple example.

5
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:30,320
Still we are solving this equation partial u partial t equal to a kappa

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:37,400
times partial square u partial x square. And von Neumann stability analysis is

7
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:44,160
not just for any domain. It's for domains without a boundary. So what does that

8
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:52,080
mean? It means von Neumann stability analysis cannot analyze the effect of

9
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,120
complex boundary conditions.

10
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,100
It doesn't mean that the boundary conditions are not

11
00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:00,160
stable. It can only analyze the stability of your discretization

12
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,180
itself. The discretization of the differential equation itself instead of

13
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:11,340
the boundary. So when you look at the differential equation and you want

14
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:17,480
to know if it's stable or not, you want to both make sure the discretization of

15
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:22,020
the PDE is stable and also the boundary condition is well-posed.

16
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,900
The discrete boundary condition is well posed. So for von Neumann stability analysis

17
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:32,940
analysis takes care of the first part. Alright, so remember in our first lecture

18
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:41,880
we did Fourier analysis, right? We split u into a summation of different

19
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:51,360
Fourier modes. k goes from minus infinity to infinity. u hat of k times e to the j

20
00:01:51,360 --> 00:02:06,300
which is the square root of minus 1 times k times x. Alright, so this is, this

21
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:19,560
can be done for periodic domain of x goes from 0 to 2 pi, right? So domains

22
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,980
without a boundary means

23
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:27,460
the best way to think of a domain without boundary is periodic. So if you

24
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:32,920
go out of one end you come back to the other. In two dimensions you can do a

25
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,160
doubly periodic domain. It's like a computer screen. If you go out of the

26
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,180
right hand side you come back from the left hand side like playing a video game.

27
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:47,920
Mathematically that domain, periodic domain in two dimensions is officially

28
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,480
called a torus.

29
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,980
Why?

30
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:57,440
Because a one dimensional periodic domain is like a circle, right? So you go out

31
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:10,460
of one end, you come back from the other. A torus is like, it's like, it's

32
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:15,680
like, it's like that. So, so it's, there are two periodic dimensions one periodic

33
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,780
is along the ring and the other periodic is around it's a wrong, it's like a dot.

34
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,900
so you have a double periodic domain.

35
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,740
But in this case,

36
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:30,080
the Newman stability analysis applies both to 1D, 2D, and 3D.

37
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,500
So let's first look at this problem in 1D.

38
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:38,320
So when we express a function on the periodic domain

39
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,340
as a Fourier series,

40
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,640
that essentially decouples

41
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,920
the different Fourier modes for a linear PDE.

42
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,660
Because when I plug this into the equation,

43
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,960
we get the left-hand side becomes a summation of

44
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,740
d u hat k dt

45
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:02,760
e to the ijx.

46
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,520
So that is the left-hand side.

47
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,980
And the right-hand side becomes

48
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:13,080
kappa times summation of u hat k

49
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,280
when you take twice derivative.

50
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,880
The jk comes out of the exponential two times.

51
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,240
So jk squared is minus k squared

52
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,780
times e to the jkx.

53
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,100
Both are summation over k

54
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,980
goes from minus infinity to infinity.

55
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,640
So if you match the coefficients,

56
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,760
the coefficients on this side is this,

57
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,140
on that side is this.

58
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,840
What you get is,

59
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,240
d u hat k dt

60
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,240
equal to kappa

61
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,380
times minus k squared

62
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,720
times u hat of k.

63
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,620
So you know all the coefficients are decaying

64
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,400
except for the k equal to 0, 1.

65
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,900
And the bigger the k is,

66
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,440
the bigger the magnitude of k is,

67
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,620
the faster the coefficient decays.

68
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,460
That is voluminous stability analysis

69
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,860
for the continuous differential equation.

70
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,860
But we can apply exactly the same thing

71
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,580
for the discrete differential equation.

72
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,440
All right.

73
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,280
Let's look at after discretization.

74
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,080
So after discretization,

75
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,860
we have...
