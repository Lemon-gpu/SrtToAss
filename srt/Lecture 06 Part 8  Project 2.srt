1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,200
so the project is not completely given out yet there is a still a question that is not given

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:16,620
but if you look at the government equations and the government equations particularly looks for

3
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:27,720
supersonic flows so we have a equation like that it should be equal to zero all right and supersonic

4
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:37,620
flows means this M infinity means the how much faster is the flow compared to the speed of sound

5
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:46,020
so it is a number that is greater than one can you see the similarity between this equation and

6
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:57,700
the equation we just looked at it's similar except for one major difference

7
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:06,760
it's there is no time right but instead the spatial derivative term have a negative sign

8
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:13,640
between X and Y and Z because M infinity is greater than one this term is actually negative

9
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:19,420
these two terms are positive if you move the negative terms to the other side of the equation

10
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:25,120
which makes it positive it's the same as our wave equation which goes on in time

11
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:39,040
so we can perfectly treat this as a time integration differential equation but like instead of

12
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:48,340
integrating time we're integrating X all right so now we are getting to the domain when there is the

13
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:55,340
difference between now we have this we can see that the difference between what we call hyperbolic

14
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,680
equations and

15
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:05,920
elliptic equations it's not just the fact that hyperbolic equations has a time in it while

16
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:12,640
elliptic equation doesn't have a time it's only a spatial thing it's actually more mathematical than

17
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:20,980
that for example this equation has no time in it but the fact it is a hyperbolic equation means it

18
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:27,520
means that you can treat the X dimension as a time and solve the equation using time integration

19
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,880
so it's essentially only the number of times tangential to the Nosmosis equation

20
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:38,220
so let's say that the N is nothing but the decimal point that happened and that we must

21
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,060
integrate the N teddy bit망 to get the percent of times N in our x-ング forecast

22
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,580
so the N possession of the x-eng of thenight is nothing

23
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:50,380
only the correct solution part of the equation half and half wheel the momentum of and that's

24
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,980
not the case you make an equation which is indeed lambda over the time except that very

25
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,940
nearly przykład

26
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:03,940
that X after where you put the perturbation and by after it doesn't mean

27
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:10,960
time it means the X location right so if you you can you can look at some of the

28
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:16,480
pictures I included these are not linearized equations these are real

29
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:22,960
experiments so so the existence of this airplane actually is not felt by the

30
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:33,100
flow for X locations smaller than where this thing is so so if you put a

31
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,700
per base in here so think of this entire airplane as a perturbation this

32
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:41,100
perturbation is not going to influence the flowfield anywhere that is upstream

33
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:47,800
so this is characteristics of a hyperbolic equation where you can think

34
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:52,860
of one of the dimensions as time where the domain of influence only happens

35
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:52,960
continuing on from国界的波波磁相对比就相反了

36
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,460
after that time.

37
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,240
Several other pictures are like that.

38
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,160
So the question is,

39
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,220
do the transformation of variables

40
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,800
and derive a system of equations you can solve?

41
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,680
And consider a lot simplified two-dimensional problem

42
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,700
and try to gain some intuition from the pictures you use

43
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,920
and derive an analytical solution

44
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,600
for the two-dimensional case.

45
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,600
And design a solver to solve this two-dimensional,

46
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,460
I mean, no, the solver is actually,

47
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,380
so design a solver for the two-dimensional problem

48
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:36,380
and justify the use of numerical schemes in the solver.

49
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,860
And compare the solution

50
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:44,240
with the analytical solution you derived.

51
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,900
All right, so play around

52
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,120
with some supersonic flow problems.
