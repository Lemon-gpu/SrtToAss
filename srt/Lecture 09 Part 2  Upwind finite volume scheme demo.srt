1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,460
So we are going to say ss is equal to this, and we are going to decide, so let's say f interface is equal to, so let's say is equal to f on the left, so 1, 2, and minus 1.

2
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:33,520
So this is saying I first choose on the left, and then I'm going to loop for i goes from 1 to length of f interface.

3
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:49,040
So let's actually make it easier. So let's say f interface is equal to just an empty array, and so let's do a loop to length of u.

4
00:00:51,460 --> 00:01:13,320
And f interface, well, let's do it to 2 to the length of u, because we have one less, we are only computing the, we only need to use this upwind formula on the interior interfaces, right?

5
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:21,440
Okay, so f interface is equal to f interface, and I want to append one more.

6
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:39,680
And the one I want to append would be depend, depend if ss of i minus 1 is greater than 0, then I want to use which side?

7
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:51,160
If it's greater than 0, I want to use the left side, yes, I want to use f of i minus 1, right?

8
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:51,440
Because.

9
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,060
Because I'm looping i goes from 2 to the end.

10
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:59,980
If I'm looping from i goes from 1 to length of u minus 1, then this would be i.

11
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,340
This would also be i.

12
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:12,220
Else f interface is equal to f interface f of i.

13
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,740
Any questions about this f interface assignment?

14
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:20,880
Okay.

15
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:31,900
So let me make it, let me also append the 0 and 0 at the both ends.

16
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,800
So this is the boundary conditions.

17
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,340
We use the same boundary conditions as we used last time.

18
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:50,580
And then du dt would be equal to f interface 1 to n minus 1 minus f interface.

19
00:02:51,460 --> 00:03:05,980
You can also add simple

20
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,540
step-by-step seguences since we're using the shape that we've already hamstrung our

21
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:08,820
tests with, and using the observation común values.

22
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,920
Next we have 2x, which follows f interface.

23
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,920
Having said that, we are blessed to know that f interface follows f demo, so we're more

24
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:11,180
launched, but we still have a little more bigger gap.

25
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,160
in dynamic configuration, for volume and mean width.

26
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:12,260
and 2013, x is equal to 2x buy a length of x.

27
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:13,560
And all the values are actual by Killer aspect only.

28
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:13,680
The only value in душit is.

29
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,100
If I enter x,

30
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,020
Great lecture.

31
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,500
IfI sport,Then the animation changes to give answer of horas innen,

32
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,040
wives depends on zone previous j value in six block,

33
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,440
so that the a time kind of we have a De worldly U.

34
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,320
So all right.

35
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,920
You can go to my have actually run an Threataland

36
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:29,380
yeah let's try it so I'm going to use a

37
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:37,060
arm so I'm going to use that say again

38
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:41,320
the same initial condition x equal to x

39
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:47,560
interface is equal to our link space of

40
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:53,140
0 1 and let's do 101 so that n is equal

41
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:58,880
to 100 so x would be equal to x

42
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:03,680
interface 1 to n minus 1 plus x

43
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,920
interface 2 to n divided by 2 so yeah so

44
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:13,240
x is going to be in the middle of the two

45
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,940
axes I'm going to use u equal to sine of

46
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,520
x times 2 pi

47
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:23,820
so if I plot x and u it'll be this sine

48
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:29,500
wave we used in our last lecture okay so

49
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:34,020
let's say we set u is equal to u 0

50
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,500
equal to u transpose that's for OD45

51
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,200
I think it accepts a column vector and

52
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:46,400
tu is equal to OD45 ddt upwind

53
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,400
and

54
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,140
we solve it last time we solve it for

55
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:57,840
for 0.1 seconds and u 0 okay so let's do

56
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,780
close plot x and u so this is still fine

57
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,780
this is also our last lecture we had the

58
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,840
same thing but I think we saw a problem

59
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,400
when we saw it for 0.3 seconds and this

60
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,900
time when we saw for 0.3 seconds we

61
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,180
still get a good solution right so so

62
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:23,400
let's do and colon so we get a solution

63
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,680
that has a shockwave sitting in the

64
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,240
middle and let's actually solve it for

65
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:34,800
one second we do the same we see okay we

66
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,480
get a we got a we got a shockwave and

67
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,720
the magnitude of this shockwave has

68
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,280
diminished from size about 1 to all the

69
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,240
way to 0.4.

70
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:51,340
if we plot all the solution at once so

71
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:55,360
we see the sine wave goes into the

72
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,280
shockwave and the shockwave starts to

73
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,140
decay

74
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:03,940
alright so that seems a nice solution

75
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,580
and you can it's interesting you can see

76
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:09,400
also see like how OD45 adapts the

77
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,080
time step over here initially it chooses

78
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,900
pretty conservative time step and it

79
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,740
starts to know it can cause them and

80
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:21,180
at this point it's a it starts to also

81
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,440
when the shockwave forms it looks like

82
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,020
the time step is decreased also a little

83
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,140
bit any questions about this upwind

84
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:36,300
scheme yes so the error comes from our

85
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:40,500
so you can think of several ways to

86
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,980
think of where the error come from so in

87
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,940
in a Taylor series analysis

88
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,600
you can think of the error coming from

89
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,200
the dispersion we have a second order

90
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,620
scheme we have we know like a second

91
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,880
order scheme from our previous

92
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,500
experience has very little dissipation

93
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,660
if any and has a lot of dispersion error

94
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,000
and the amount of dispersion error is

95
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,540
proportional to Delta x square and it's

96
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:12,060
also proportional to some derivative of

97
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,580
the function i think is third order

98
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,080
derivative if I'm not wrong.

99
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,260
so so it's proportional to third order

100
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,540
derivative times Delta x square if you

101
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,000
have a discontinuity how big is the

102
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,500
third order derivative it's going to be

103
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,820
huge right it's going to be when you

104
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,300
have something that is very oscillatory

105
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,340
like like a shockwave you have a very

106
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,520
very large third order derivative so

107
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,940
that causes a lot of dispersion error so

108
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,680
from that perspective last lecture we

109
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,300
also looked at the central difference

110
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,180
scheme

111
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:50,800
being something that conserves the cubed

112
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,080
solution so the conservation of these

113
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,860
higher-order statistics is going to of

114
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,440
the higher-order quantity is going to

115
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,320
prevent the solution from getting

116
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:09,480
dissipated right because because if you

117
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,940
have a solution like this at later time

118
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:16,180
it definitely has a has a small

119
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:20,620
integrated u cubed than the original

120
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:24,880
solution that's also something the

121
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,480
second-order central flux scheme cannot

122
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:33,700
capture correctly. The reason for

123
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,660
choosing that is one it so from

124
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,940
monumous stability analysis actually

125
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,940
from the modified equation analysis we

126
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,560
see that using an up-ending scheme is

127
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,400
going to

128
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:50,860
numerical dissipation right and it is

129
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,900
actually dissipation that we need over

130
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:57,580
here we need the scheme to be dissipated

131
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,160
by the shockwave the shockwave is

132
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,120
actually a inherently dissipative

133
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,240
phenomenon and if you look at a shock

134
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,520
wave of a real fluid flow of like

135
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,000
aerodynamics in a supersonic flow the

136
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,060
shockwave is very very thin so so here

137
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,860
like mathematically a shockwave is a

138
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:21,580
discontinuity in a real physics you

139
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,920
don't really have any discontinuities

140
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,600
but you have something extremely thin

141
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,300
it's so thin that the shockwave is on

142
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:32,140
the order of like 10 to 100 of the the

143
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,240
mean free path of the molecules so it's

144
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,500
like really really small and the

145
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,800
dissipation although the shockwave is

146
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,180
very thin the amount of physical

147
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,140
dissipation occurring during inside the

148
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,940
shockwave is is massive.

149
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,340
That's just because the length scale is

150
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,260
so small and molecules from one side

151
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,720
goes to the other side and they mix

152
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,540
together the amount of dissipation it's

153
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,440
so a lot of dissipation is appearing

154
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,840
there so even though we have an inviscid

155
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,920
equation we approximate the equation as

156
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,440
inviscid there is still a lot of

157
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,720
dissipation going on at discontinuities

158
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,020
and that is like the physical reason why

159
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:15,460
we need a dissipative scheme to resolve

160
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:20,140
discontinuities. That satisfies what you

161
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:27,580
are curious about. Any other questions?

162
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,780
And in fact a lot of modern numerical

163
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,100
methods they are trying to be high order

164
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,980
away from the shockwaves but at the

165
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,240
shockwaves you need a lot of numerical

166
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,400
dissipation because you can never be

167
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,860
your grid can never resolve the shockwave.

168
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,900
If your grid can resolve the

169
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,440
shockwave if your grid size is

170
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,980
actually like ten times the mean free

171
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,260
path of the molecules you don't need any

172
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,600
numerical dissipations you just need

173
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,240
physical dissipations you put the amount

174
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,720
of viscosity of air into the scheme and

175
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,060
you can have the appropriate amount of

176
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,200
dissipation but your grid can never

177
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,440
resolve that so that in that case you

178
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,300
need numerical dissipation to do the

179
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,120
same amount of work. Yes?

180
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,140
If your grid could resolve that can you just use one more difference?

181
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,340
If your grid can resolve that, yeah.

182
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,680
You can use finite differencing and

183
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,220
with not with not with this equation

184
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,620
but with the equation that includes the

185
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:26,460
physical viscosity so include a second

186
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,440
order derivative in x term and then you

187
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,000
can yeah you can use finite difference

188
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,320
you actually converge to a real
