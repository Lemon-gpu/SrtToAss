1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,380
So the weak form in general, we only did the weak form for Poisson's equation, but there are also weak forms for many other equations.

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:15,840
So in general, the weak form contains two elements. One element is what's called a bilinear form.

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:24,960
And we write it as a of u and v.

4
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:39,940
So an example of the bilinear form we have before is minus integration of a to b, the derivative of x times the derivative of v.

5
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,940
It is equal to...

6
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:45,700
So this is the...

7
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:45,820
So this is the...

8
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:45,840
So this is the...

9
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,080
So this is the...

10
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,380
Bilinear form.

11
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,500
It has to satisfy a certain number of criteria.

12
00:00:51,780 --> 00:01:14,020
First of all, a times any c1 times u1 plus c2 times u2, v has to be equal to c1 times a of u1, v plus c2 times u2, v.

13
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,020
So this is simply...

14
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,840
So this is simply a linearity in the first argument.

15
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:24,640
It also has to satisfy a similar linearity in the second argument.

16
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:40,000
It's equal to c1 times a of u, v1 plus c2, there is an a here, a, u, and v2.

17
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:41,840
Right.

18
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:41,900
Right.

19
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,760
So this is the standard.

20
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:45,820
So this is the standard.

21
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:50,980
definition of what is linear and the reason it's called bilinear is that

22
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:57,100
because it is linear with respect to both its arguments. In this example it's

23
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,900
pretty clear why each of them are linear. If you perform linear combination

24
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:05,640
of u, you can pull these linear combination coefficients out of the

25
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,200
integral. Alternatively, if you perform any linear combination of v,

26
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,440
you can also pull these linear combination coefficients out of the

27
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:20,040
integral. And in our example this bilinearform has a particularly nice

28
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,620
property. It's symmetrical, right, so if we exchange u and v in these two

29
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:32,360
arguments, the value doesn't change. And this, if you remember, has

30
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:38,060
an intimate relationship with the symmetry of the matrix A we got out of

31
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:42,260
discretizing using finite element. okay but

32
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,220
But like this, it's only vodka.

33
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:43,400
And this one is also a complete example. mentions and use to each idle.

34
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:53,320
for other equations, for example, if we have odd derivatives in the equation, in the differential

35
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,180
equation, then the bilinear form we're going to get is no longer going to be symmetric.

36
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:05,540
Okay, the other element we need in defining the weak form is a linear functional.

37
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:13,680
We call it L of v.

38
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:23,800
So L of v, in our previous example, we have this integration of f times v dx is equal

39
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,920
to our L of v.

40
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,700
So L of v has a single argument because f is predefined.

41
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,320
f is a known function, is a given known function.

42
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,520
So L of v is a single argument because f is predefined.

43
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:35,540
So L of v has a single argument because f is predefined.

44
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:48,440
So another example of a linear functional is L of v simply equal to v at 0.5, right?

45
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,920
Our previous example of like when f is a delta function.

46
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,320
So that's also a linear functional.

47
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:03,140
The linear functional has to satisfy a very similar criterion as the bilinear form.

48
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,320
It has to satisfy L.

49
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:16,160
So L of c1 v1 plus c2 v2 has to equal to c1 times L of v1 plus c2 L of v2.

50
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,440
That's why it's called a linear functional.

51
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:26,100
Now, once we define the bilinear form and the linear functional, the weak form

52
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:34,000
also requires a space.

53
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,280
So actually,

54
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,120
the bilinear form and linear functional, they both require a certain space.

55
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,620
So u and v are in a certain space.

56
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,360
And this is v in a certain linear space.

57
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,120
I mean, they should have a...

58
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,240
In the simplest form of finite element, the u and v should be in the same space.

59
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,840
Then we've got what's called a Galerkin method.

60
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,060
And in more advanced treatments, u and v can belong to different linear spaces.

61
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:15,740
But no matter what you do, the v in the bilinear form and the L in the linear functional has to be in the same linear space.

62
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:22,600
So the weak form is to find u within x.

63
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:30,920
So let's actually make it clear, make it more general by saying that u is in a certain x u.

64
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,100
This is in x v.

65
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,440
This is in x v.

66
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:50,380
So find u in x u such that a u v plus L of v equal to zero for any v in this space x v.

67
00:05:50,380 --> 00:06:02,380
And a special case is u...

68
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,040
It's x u.

69
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,780
It's x u is equal to x v.

70
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,120
That's called a Galerkin method.

71
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:18,960
Well, Galerkin method also requires the space of x u and x v to be the same.

72
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:24,740
And we are also discretizing x u and x v in the same way.

73
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:29,740
When we go from this infinite dimensional space to a finite dimensional space,

74
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:33,740
we are also selecting the basis.

75
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,540
And this is also in the same way.

76
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,180
All right.

77
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:44,760
So this is a general form of the weak form of differential equation.

78
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:53,080
And for a lot of differential equations out there, we can find this kind of weak forms that represent the differential equation,

79
00:06:53,080 --> 00:07:03,180
but gives more general solutions, even if the right-hand side of the differential equation or some coefficients in the differential equation is no longer well-defined functions.

80
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,180
Okay.

81
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:09,140
An example I can give is the following.

82
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:14,580
An example I can give is in structural mechanics,

83
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:23,700
people often solve some kind of equations for structural elements like a beam.

84
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,260
And the simplest form of...

85
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:29,280
Basically, all the beam equations involve fourth-order derivatives.

86
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,800
But the simplest beam equation, the Euler beam equation,

87
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,200
has a form like that.

88
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:41,920
So the fourth-order derivative of the solution plus f is equal to zero.

89
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:52,920
And here, u describes the bending of a beam, and f is the loading on the beam.

90
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:59,120
So f and u is the...

91
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,240
f is loading.

92
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,080
And u is the...

93
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,240
So f is loading.

94
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,280
And u is the...

95
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:02,440
And u is the...

96
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:02,680
And u is the...

97
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:02,780
And u is the...

98
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,160
And u is deflection.

99
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,020
All right.

100
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:09,800
So...

101
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,800
And...

102
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:20,060
We can derive the weak form again by multiplying a test function u

103
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:24,960
on this equation.

104
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:31,140
So let's say this is a, this is b, dx is equal to zero.

105
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:37,700
And because u involves a fourth-order derivative, we need more comprehensive boundary conditions

106
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,820
than what we have for the Poisson's equation.

107
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,900
So the boundary condition for the beam can be a simple support can be clamped.

108
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:50,480
A simple support means the value of u has to be a certain value, which means the position

109
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,640
has to be fixed.

110
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:58,440
And also, it has no bending moments, which means the second-order derivative of u has

111
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,440
to be zero.

112
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,500
I mean, second-order derivative is like...

113
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,040
Second-order derivative is like the curvature.

114
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,000
Or it can be clamped, which means the first-order and...

115
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
The u and the first-order derivative has to be zero, which means, like, the slope has

116
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
to be fixed.

117
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:21,140
So, so let's, let's, for example, give a used example of u and u derivative both equal

118
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:25,340
to zero at zero and one, or at a and b.

119
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:30,380
Then, during the integration by parts...

120
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:41,380
Okay, so, so if we have this, of course, when we define a u , u also has to satisfy,

121
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:50,380
satisfy these boundary conditions.

122
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:54,880
Okay, and, and then what, what is u ?

123
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,380
u is going to be...

124
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,380
So, x u, sorry.

125
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,380
x u is...

126
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:08,980
x u is actually the Sobolev space in between a and b of two, because in this case, u is

127
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,780
taking a fourth-order derivative.

128
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:17,940
And when we derive the Sobolev space, we're going to find out that although we won't require

129
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:22,160
that the solution and the test function to have a fourth-order derivative, but they need

130
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,880
to have a second-order derivative.

131
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,880
Okay.

132
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,380
So, what we're going to get over here is that...

133
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:36,380
We integrate by parts once, so a and b, v of fourth derivative of x.

134
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:45,380
If we integrate by, by parts once, we get a minus sign, we get a derivative of v, and

135
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:49,380
we get a third-order derivative of u.

136
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:56,380
And we integrate by parts twice, the negative sign is gone again, and we have a second-order

137
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,380
derivative of v and a second-order derivative of u.

138
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,380
Okay.

139
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,320
So, we have the может if y equal to plane distance.

140
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:06,040
And this is going to be a product of the first-order derivative of u.

141
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:10,660
So, let me maybe give you a little bit more of a sense of the meaning, of физene usually.

142
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,020
This is our assertion in here.

143
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,580
We have a product of u.

144
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:18,260
So, we're going to use this condition.

145
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:26,540
And we'll take our position of becomes theets and that's the solution.

146
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,680
Okay.

147
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:36,500
and what is our linear functional it's gonna be the same right integration of

148
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:49,340
V and F so that completes our derivation of the weak form so the ingredients of

149
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:54,760
the weak form first of all we need to define the space of the solution and the

150
00:11:54,760 --> 00:12:00,580
test function in this case both can be H2 we also need to define a bilinear

151
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:05,080
form in this case the product of the second derivatives we need to define a

152
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:11,080
linear functional in this case the product of the test function V with the

153
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:20,620
known function F okay and we can use find elements to solve this we can

154
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,600
construct a in this case we are going to notice that

155
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:24,740
P is the same as the test function so we need to define the product of the second

156
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:28,220
derivative and of course to use a bilinear function the Appозiter will

157
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:31,720
stop the math so we are going to Chinese easily爽z Professor

158
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:50,220
so,Where do you replace with this tableни에 f

159
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,660
so,We need to free hey

160
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,960
we are going to solve the same matrix equation,

161
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,960
A U equal to B,

162
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,800
to get the linear combination coefficients

163
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,060
of these piecewise quadratic basis functions.

164
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:10,340
And then the solution has to be reconstructed

165
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,960
using the linear combination coefficients

166
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,940
on these piecewise quadratic basis functions.

167
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,820
All right.

168
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,600
So this is just another example
