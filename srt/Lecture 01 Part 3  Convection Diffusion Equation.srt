00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
The first type of equations we are going to study is called convection diffusion

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:16,740
equations. The reason we are studying this equation, partial u, partial t, plus a

3
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:23,840
big U, which is different from the small u, partial u, partial x, equal to kappa

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:32,080
partial square u, partial x square, plus f. So this is the convection diffusion

5
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:40,700
equation. This equation has sufficient variation and complexity that it can be

6
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:48,620
a back of the envelope model for a lot of physical problems. So not only because

7
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:53,500
it's useful but also it is amenable to

8
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:53,800
normalization.

9
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:00,980
Not only numerical methods but also analytical methods. And the fact that it is amenable

10
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:08,560
to analytical methods makes it a very good introductory differential equation for us

11
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:15,680
to solve using numerical methods and then compare the result to solutions using analytical

12
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:22,680
methods. And by doing that we can understand how accurate our numerical solution is and

13
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:31,080
how does the accuracy vary as we change different numerical explanations like 기다� desar

14
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,740
changes.

15
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:42,080
So for example in thermal engineering, this U can be used to describe the temperature

16
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:49,680
of theITEM percentage of the spatial domain over time.

17
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,600
Cool when you do know you can extend these equations up to more при substances that are

18
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:50,860
required Though we also know that heavy air pleasanties can also play a counter-stem setup.

19
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,220
This much the experiment is receipt for the most important ideal of Thermal Engineering.

2 9- día

21
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:51,880
Interesting.

Señor que estaprofit en windows delare.

23
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:52,460
Class of 2011.

24
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:52,540
Tu por favor.

25
00:01:52,540 --> 00:02:01,780
want to give is the bathtub problem. So in 2016 I participated in this

26
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:05,620
international contest of mathematical modeling when I was an undergraduate

27
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:11,260
student and I've been following all these problems in the later years. The

28
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:18,400
problem this year is quite interesting. It asks about a person in a bathtub. So

29
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,840
he just wants to relax and having a very hot bathtub. But the temperature of

30
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:31,360
course becomes slowly decreases as he relaxes. So he wants to keep the same

31
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,880
temperature and by doing that he can turn on the faucet which dumps hot water

32
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:43,840
into the bathtub and then shut it down by his will. And he can drain the water

33
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,380
from the bathtub. So the question for the mathematical contest of modeling

34
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:53,840
is how should he waste as little water as possible while maintaining a

35
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:00,920
comfortable and uniform temperature distribution. So that's an interesting

36
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:06,640
question and of course to me naturally the the appropriate answer to that is

37
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,840
solving partial differential equations. And this one is a perfect model for that

38
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:18,200
problem because we are going to see later this term can be used to model

39
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:18,360
a

40
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,860
temperature distribution. So this is a very simple model. It's going to show how

41
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:28,920
the temperature is going to go from non uniform to more and more uniform as time

42
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:34,260
evolves. And this term, the convection term, is going to describe the evolution

43
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:40,980
of the temperature due to the bulk flow of water through the bathtub. And this

44
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:46,200
term is going to describe how much heat you are losing through evaporation and

45
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,180
conduction to the outside of the world.

46
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:55,080
So this is the equation that describes the evolution time derivative of the

47
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:03,300
temperature due to a combination of the rest of the terms. So this is one

48
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:07,080
application of this equation. Other application include in environmental

49
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:14,060
engineering. The same equation is used to describe the concentration of pollutant.

50
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:18,000
Some of you are working in the aviation and the

51
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
aviation industry. And you may be interested in how pollutants in the

52
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,500
atmosphere is carried by convection, which is this term, and diffusion, which

53
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:38,220
is this term, and sources and sinks of pollutants. This is generation of the

54
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:46,620
pollutants by cars, power stations, and removal of the pollutants by rainfall,

55
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,120
for example.

56
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,240
And in petroleum engineering, a very similar equation can be used to describe

57
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:00,000
the fraction of water or oil in the reservoir. And in financial engineering,

58
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,300
the same equation can be described the price of an option. So diverse

59
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:13,620
applications. A limiting case. So let's study a few limiting cases of this

60
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,460
equation.

61
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,460
Okay, so first of all,

62
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
when the U is equal to zero.

63
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:32,400
And F is equal to zero. This is just a partial U, partial T equal to kappa, partial

64
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:39,420
square U, partial X squared. That's called heat equation. Because it describes the

65
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:47,880
evolution of temperature over a stationary solid object. The second case

66
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:55,040
is, when kappa is equal to zero, F is equal to zero, the question becomes partial

67
00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:02,100
u, partial t, plus big U, times partial u, partial x, equal to zero. That is linear

68
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:07,960
advection equation. That describes the evolution of a field driven by a

69
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,780
constant wind field. And when both, when both U is equal and your T stage is a constant, if never a center positivex inverse, thezt

70
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:15,680
New, where dm, d, t, t, and enfrentk évidemment, dm, 0. And d, t, t, p, how often

71
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,740
you want to deliberate whether it is equal or opposite, now there's another way of saying that in serious

72
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,900
both u is equal to zero and time goes to infinity.

73
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:26,180
The equation becomes kappa plus your square u

74
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,900
plus your x square plus f equal to zero.

75
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,480
So time goes away.

76
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,900
That equation is called Poisson's equation.

77
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,500
It describes the equilibrium state

78
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,140
of certain physical phenomenons,

79
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:44,520
like elasticity and diffusion.
