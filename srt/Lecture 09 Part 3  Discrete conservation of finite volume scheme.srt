1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
So one thing I want to point out is the discrete conservation properties of any final volume scheme.

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,000
So now we have a working scheme, we want to point out its advantage.

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,200
And that actually corresponds to your question, which is, can we use final difference?

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,880
Yes we can, but we are losing something important in a conservation scheme.

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:27,240
So if we have a differential equation in the conservation law form,

6
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:37,980
and we can integrate, when we integrate over any interval, not just one grid point,

7
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,840
let's say A to B, where A and B can be very different, U to X,

8
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,520
we know from the conservative form of the equation,

9
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:53,000
this is equal to F of U at A minus F of U at B, right?

10
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,840
So this is a natural conservation.

11
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:03,260
So this is a conservation type of expression, because the, sorry, I have a DDT here,

12
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:08,680
the time derivative of a total amount of stuff is equal to what's going in minus what's going out.

13
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:19,440
Okay, and in a lot of cases, the numerical schemes may not satisfy that conservation.

14
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:26,960
So I have, I think last year or two years ago, I saw an interesting cell phone app.

15
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,120
It's called Wind Tunnel.

16
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,640
I don't know how many of you have looked at it.

17
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:32,560
You looked at it?

18
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:38,060
Anybody else have looked at the, like it's a free app, iPhone or Android called Wind Tunnel.

19
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:48,380
It solves the fluid flow equation with, on your screen, and you can draw any shape on the screen.

20
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,120
What's interesting is that it looks very real, actually.

21
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,060
But what's interesting is that you can draw something like a band,

22
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:05,400
like a bag around the screen, and you're going to see like some flow is going to go into the bag and never comes out.

23
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,220
So things keeps going into this bag that you draw on the screen.

24
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,160
You can play with it after a while.

25
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:21,020
So that's a very interesting example of a PDU solver not satisfying conservation law.

26
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,980
Do you mind drawing the bag and see if it conserves the mass?

27
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,400
Okay, so you have a screen, right?

28
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:35,460
And you have flow, I mean, they have visualization of smoke or something.

29
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:41,660
And if you can draw, let's say you can draw an airfoil with an opening here,

30
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,980
and you're going to see the smoke goes into the airfoil and there is no place for it to come out.

31
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:54,460
What I'm trying to say is that finite volume schemes would never create something like that.

32
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,220
Because if you have a screen, you can draw a bag, and you can draw a bag around the screen.

33
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,020
If you discretize the equation using a finite volume scheme,

34
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:12,280
you have dui dt equal to f, so I want to multiply delta x on this side,

35
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,100
fi minus half minus fi plus half.

36
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,580
All right, let me keep writing this.

37
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:27,220
dui plus 1 dt is equal to f of i plus half.

38
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,640
minus fi plus 1 and half.

39
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,240
Now, what's important in finite volume is that

40
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:42,940
the way we computed this fi plus half is exactly the way we computed this fi plus half.

41
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,520
Right?

42
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,840
So it's the same number in our code.

43
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,820
So the f interface is a vector of length n plus 1.

44
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,520
The same fi.

45
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,940
But when you add them together, it takes 1 integral.

46
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,940
And once we come to the point where we can spread it out,

47
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,240
the derivative is that if ui is 1,

48
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,520
when ui is an integral of length n plus half,

49
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:16,420
it's used for computing the derivative of ui and ui plus 1.

50
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,000
Okay, so that's very important.

51
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,200
If you violate that, it's no longer a finite volume scheme.

52
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:28,980
The discrete integral, I mean, if you sum over these two,

53
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,880
remember this is a cell average, this is also a cell average.

54
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,520
The summation of these two is actually the total amount of u inside these two grid points.

55
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:44,660
It is equal to one flux minus the other flux at these two ends of this interval.

56
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:51,420
Although the value of this flux involves approximation, but the form is still the same.

57
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:57,960
So you can keep writing that all the way to f of n, let's say, at the very end.

58
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,780
This is equal to f of n minus half minus f of n plus half.

59
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:09,200
If you add all of this together, every pair cancels except for the very first one and very last one.

60
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,980
Although the form of this flux involves approximation,

61
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:17,960
but the fact that the interior flux cancel each other has no problem.

62
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,960
So, for example, if you draw...

63
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:27,540
If you have boundary condition saying that the last flux has to be zero at some point,

64
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:32,780
that's equivalent of if you draw a bag where the end you have no flux.

65
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:40,000
Then it means that if I have flow goes into the first cell,

66
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:45,980
then the time derivative of my total mass inside all this volume has to increase.

67
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,000
And in an aerodynamic solver, for example, as the mass increases,

68
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,320
the pressure is going to increase.

69
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:59,080
And ultimately, it's going to push the flow back out of the inlet of the bag.

70
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:08,180
So you can't have something that flows into a closed volume indefinitely if you use finite volume.

71
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:16,880
If discrete conservation of mass or momentum or energy is important for you,

72
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,080
then it's another motivation to use finite volume.

73
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:24,420
Instead of another way of discretization.

74
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:30,920
And also, we are going to be talking about it a little bit later.

75
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:38,040
Another advantage of finite volume is it is a lot easier to deal with non-uniform,

76
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,620
non-Cartesian complex mesh,

77
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:47,840
which is useful for complex geometry using finite volume compared to finite difference.

78
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,540
Okay.

79
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,540
Finite difference is...

80
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:57,040
It's very easy to use for Cartesian uniform grid.

81
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,680
As the grid gets more and more complex,

82
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,920
the complexity of finite difference scheme becomes...

83
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,660
Increases very rapidly.

84
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,420
While finite volume scheme, they stay...

85
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,260
We're going to see like in 1D uniform mesh,

86
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:17,140
it is not easy to do a finite volume scheme with more than first order.

87
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,140
But the same complexity actually carries to 2D,

88
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,180
3D unstructured mesh.

89
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:29,420
So your complexity won't increase much as you go to very complex geometry.

90
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,040
Alright.

91
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:36,540
So this is the pros and cons of finite difference versus finite volume.

92
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,540
If you choose a way of discretizing.

93
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:48,260
By the way, there are schemes in finite difference that also have discrete conservation properties.

94
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,020
But it's not automatic.

95
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,220
You need to be very...

96
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,220
You need to work hard to get that.

97
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:59,220
Kind of choose your discretization schemes, do a lot of analysis to get that.

98
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,220
While you find that volume is automatic.

99
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:06,220
No matter what kind of flux you use, what kind of approximation you use on the flux,

100
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:11,220
it discretely conserves what you are conserving.
