1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,400
So for example, there is this equation called the Berkeley-Leverett equation

2
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:19,920
that models how oil and water flows in the porous media, for example, an oil

3
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:27,300
reservoir. Okay, so and particularly describes the flow of oil and water

4
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:35,860
under a constant driven flow. So think of the total volumetric flow is constant.

5
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:43,940
So you have a porous media, you have a sponge or rock or something, and you have

6
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:48,980
your injecting water on the left side and you see what comes out on the right

7
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:56,460
side. And because oil and water have different properties, they don't really

8
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,220
mix together.

9
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:57,280
So the beauty of the flow is what it can merge into. So for example, if I have a

10
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,720
very well but the some of them are trapping small pores and they're off

11
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:08,260
surface tension etc if you look at the time evolution of a saturation for

12
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:17,380
example of oil DT it is not going to be so if if oil and water they are the same

13
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:25,540
material they are the same of the so if there is no porous media the situation

14
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:33,460
just at bats in a pipe linearly I would have partial s o partial X equal to zero

15
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:37,660
right so that's linear vector equation if I have a certain waveform of

16
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:41,900
saturation in the beginning that way would shift towards the right if there

17
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:47,500
was no porous media but the existence of porous media makes it a nonlinear

18
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:55,300
conservation law the F actually depends on the saturation at that local point

19
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:55,500
okay

20
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:55,520
okay

21
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:25,520


22
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:31,280
region the flux of oil oil is more like in the free flow is in the bigger pour

23
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:38,000
so that they get pushed faster and as you approach full saturation equal to

24
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:46,280
warm everything is oil and water is now trapped into small pores that makes the

25
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,320
flux of oil to be more or less independent of how much water there is

26
00:02:51,320 --> 00:03:00,580
so it's it the curve becomes flat again so this is this is a an example of a

27
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:06,140
scalar conservation law where you can use only one variable to denote the

28
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:14,200
state and all flux is a direct a scalar function of that one one variable more

29
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:21,280
often we have a system of conservation laws in which my U is a vector and

30
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:21,300
it has a function that is a value of u so if I have a function that is a state and I

31
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:26,380
is momentum and density, for example, or momentum, density, and energy.

32
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:33,680
And the flux of mass would depend on the momentum.

33
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,160
The flux of momentum would depend on the density.

34
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,500
The flux of energy would depend on also momentum and energy.

35
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,000
So you have a system of conservation loss,

36
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:48,000
but then always the flux, be it a vector or a scalar,

37
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,640
is completely determined by the state at that local point.

38
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,300
The state can be, again, a scalar or a vector.
