1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:05,320
We are often asking a question, when does the Jacobi iteration converge?

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,940
When does it not converge?

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:15,440
And it is very hard to figure out a necessary condition for the convergence.

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,960
It's very hard to figure out a sufficient and necessary condition for the convergence.

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:26,320
But there are sufficient conditions for the convergence of Jacobi iteration, which means

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,880
there are some conditions you can check, and if it satisfies this condition, then you know

7
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,640
Jacobi iteration is going to converge.

8
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:40,080
So for example, one of the methods to check the convergence of a Jacobi iteration is called

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:48,700
a diagonal dominance.

10
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,660
What does diagonal dominance mean?

11
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,340
If you have a matrix.

12
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,300
The diagonal entries.

13
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:04,000
Of A, of this matrix A. A , A , etc. to A .

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:12,300
The absolute values of the diagonal entries, if they are larger than the sum of the absolute

15
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:16,180
values of all of its off-diagonals.

16
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:24,860
Okay so let's say A, the off-diagonals, I will just use another color to denote it.

17
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,620
A , A , etc.

18
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:41,320
So if the absolute value of A for any k is greater than the summation of I not equal

19
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:47,680
to k of A absolute value.

20
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,100
This is called diagonal dominance.

21
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,600
Actually this is called strict diagonal dominance.

22
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,000
If you have greater or equal.

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,560
A non-strict diagonal dominance.

24
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:06,460
Remember for our Poisson's equation, do we have strict diagonal dominance?

25
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:13,620
No, but we have the weaker non-strict diagonal dominance, right, because the diagonals are

26
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,960
minus two and the off-diagonals, we have two off-diagonals, both one and one.

27
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,260
In the 2D Poisson's equation the diagonal is minus four.

28
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,120
The off-diagonals, we have four ones.

29
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,000
In 3D, the diagonal is minus one.

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,840
Okay.

31
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,780
the diagonal would be minus 6 and we have 6 off-diagonals. And if you remember

32
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:36,340
our finite element case when we solve the Poisson's equation, we also have a

33
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:47,500
non-strict version of diagonal dominance. Alright, so if a matrix is diagonally

34
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:54,640
dominant, we know that Jacobi iteration converges. So how do we know that? We need

35
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:05,620
use a theorem called theêug Positive circle theorem. So what

36
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:15,520
does that mean? It means the eigenvalues of a matrix, so the lambda k of a matrix

37
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:22,780
are the lambda k has to lie in at least the one of the so

38
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,600
called a digestible

39
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:24,620
matrix. So every ment realtà pose uma esn da equação blindada...

40
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:42,040
circle. So every lambda k must be within a circle that is defined as all the lambdas,

41
00:03:42,040 --> 00:04:04,340
such that lambda minus one of the diagonals is less or equal to the summation of the i not equal to k, a, i, or a, k, i.

42
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,360
So in the complex plane, this is a circle.

43
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:21,480
It's a circle centered at a, k, k with a diameter of the summation of the absolute value of the diagonal entries.

44
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:32,720
Okay, that means all the eigenvalues have to lie in the union of all the Gershgorin circles.

45
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,980
And each Gershgorin circle corresponds to one row of the matrix.

46
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,120
So why is that the case?

47
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:55,860
It's the case because if we have a eigenvalue, let me say a times vk equal to lambda k times vk.

48
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:02,040
Okay, so if that is the case, let's pick.

49
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,040
So, okay, so let's actually use j here.

50
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,240
Instead of k.

51
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:16,040
So a times vj is equal to lambda j times vj.

52
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:34,440
So let's pick k such that vkj, so the kth entry of the vector vj, has greatest magnitude.

53
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,280
Okay.

54
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:38,440
Which means vkj.

55
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:48,040
vkj is greater than vij for any i not equal to k.

56
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,700
All right, greater or equal.

57
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,780
So why is this helpful?

58
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,940
It's helpful because we can write this equality.

59
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:07,320
We can write the specific line of that equality as the summation of that particular line of the matrix,

60
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,220
which is a.

61
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:21,840
So vkj times vij would be equal to the corresponding line of the right-hand side, which is lambda j times what?

62
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,780
What is the corresponding row of lambda j times vj?

63
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,240
If I choose the kth row.

64
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:33,280
Vkj.

65
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,560
Yeah, vkj, right.

66
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,640
Great.

67
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:49,160
So now let's try to move all the vkj's to one side and all the non-vkj's to the other side.

68
00:06:49,160 --> 00:07:07,940
What we get is akk times vkj minus lambda j times vkj would be equal to the minus of the summation of all the i not equal to j of aki times vij.

69
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:08,080
Okay.

70
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,120
Okay.

71
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,200
Okay.

72
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:08,240
Okay.

73
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:08,340
Okay.

74
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:08,380
Okay.

75
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:08,420
Okay.

76
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:08,440
Okay.

77
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:08,700
Okay.

78
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:08,720
Okay.

79
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:08,740
Okay.

80
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:08,760
Okay.

81
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:08,780
Okay.

82
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:08,820
Okay.

83
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:08,840
Okay.

84
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:08,900
Okay.

85
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:08,940
Okay.

86
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:08,960
Okay.

87
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,060
Okay.

88
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:09,760
Okay.

89
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:09,900
Okay.

90
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:09,940
Okay.

91
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:10,200
Okay.

92
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:11,240
Okay.

93
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:11,320
Okay.

94
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:11,800
Okay.

95
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:12,360
Okay.

96
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:13,540
Okay.

97
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:13,600
Okay.

98
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:14,700
Okay.

99
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,420
Okay.

100
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:15,880
Okay.

101
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,240
Okay.

102
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:16,420
Okay.

103
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:16,900
Okay.

104
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,540
Okay.

105
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,260
Okay.

106
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:22,380
Okay.

107
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:22,580
Okay.

108
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,340
Okay.

109
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:29,500
Okay.

110
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,340
Okay.

111
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:31,380
Okay.

112
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,100
Okay.

113
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:35,840
Okay.

114
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:36,360
Okay.

115
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:36,380
Okay.

116
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:36,500
Okay.

117
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:36,820
Okay.

118
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,120
Okay.

119
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:37,420
Okay.

120
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:37,480
Okay.

121
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,080
Okay.

122
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,440
Okay.

123
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:38,580
Okay.

124
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:38,720
Okay.

125
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:38,740
Okay.

126
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,980
Ki times Vij.

127
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:47,540
Oh, by the way, I have moved the absolute value from outside the summation to inside the summation.

128
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,040
Therefore, we have a less or equal to sign.

129
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:54,700
So we have a less or equal because just moving the absolute value to here.

130
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,160
Vkj.

131
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:02,760
And also we know this is strictly less or equal to 1.

132
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:08,300
Because we have chosen Vkj to be the largest among all the Vij's.

133
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,100
So this again is going to be a summation.

134
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,140
Oh, here we also have absolute value.

135
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:18,640
Summation i not equal to k, absolute value of aki.

136
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,080
Right?

137
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,660
So here we prove the Gershgorian theorem.

138
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,240
Basically, all the eigenvalues have to lie in one of these circles.

139
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:33,720
And fortunately, for a diagonally dominant matrix, the Jacobi iteration matrix,

140
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:38,420
has Gershgorian theorem.

141
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:48,280
It has Gershgorian's circles that are very friendly to us.

142
00:08:48,280 --> 00:09:01,500
In the sense that the minus D inverse times L plus U would be equal to a matrix that is minus 0 on the diagonal.

143
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,420
Because we already removed the diagonal, we are looking at L plus U.

144
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,540
And all the diagonal entries are, for example,

145
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:14,300
a12 divided by a11, a13 divided by a11, etc.

146
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:20,300
So the Gershgorian circles are centered at 0 because all the akks are 0.

147
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:20,800
Right?

148
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,960
So if you look at the complex plane, all the circles are centered at 0.

149
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,960
How about the diameters?

150
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:34,180
The diameters are the summation of the absolute value of all these diagonal entries.

151
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:37,380
And we know that if we are diagonally dominant,

152
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,120
the a11 is the absolute value of all these diagonal entries.

153
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,520
And we know that if we are diagonally dominant, the a11 is the absolute value of all these diagonal entries.

154
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,060
And we know that if we are diagonally dominant, the a11 is the absolute value of all these diagonal entries.

155
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:45,460
So this A1 would be greater than the summation of all the absolute values of the diagonal entries.

156
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:51,520
So the diameter, which is the summation of all these absolute values, would be less than what?

157
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,940
So the diameter, which is the summation of all these absolute values, would be less than what?

158
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,800
1.

159
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,800
Right.

160
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:00,300
So all the Gershgorian circles would be centered at around 0 with various diameters,

161
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,560
but all of them are less than 1.

162
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,940
What does that mean in terms of the eigenvalues of the Jacobi iteration matrix?

163
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:03,940
This is not the answer.

164
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,140
There are 4 different argumentations.

165
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,460
But there are 4 different arguments about the force of these numbers.

166
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,460
So this is a very complex problem.

167
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:07,880
Very lost argument.

168
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,300
Thank you very much.

169
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:18,240
they have to lie on a circle that has to be strictly within the stability region, right?

170
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:24,960
So basically all the eigenvalues have to have its magnitude less than 1.

171
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:32,680
Therefore, for diagonally dominant matrices, we are guaranteed to converge.

172
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:47,320
And we can also have a similar argument of saying that for non-strictly diagonally dominant matrices like the Poisson's equation,

173
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:58,920
we would have some Gershgorian circles that are exactly having a radius of 1.

174
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:00,960
Okay.

175
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:06,040
So then what we know is all the eigenvalues of the Jacobi iteration matrix,

176
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,080
they cannot have magnitude greater than 1.

177
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,800
But they can potentially have magnitude equal to 1.

00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,240
could be
