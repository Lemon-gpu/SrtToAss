1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,400
So find everything in 2D. So here, to limit time, we're just going to focus on one single equation.

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:18,480
We are focusing on the Laplace equation, the divergence of the gradient of a scalar function u plus f is equal to 0.

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:33,340
Okay, and in particular, let's focus first on the very simple case where u is equal to 0 at the boundary of a domain.

4
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:39,120
So we have a domain omega, and the boundary of the domain is called partial omega.

5
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,780
Okay, so u is equal to 0 everywhere on the domain.

6
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,120
And here, let's also...

7
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:48,120
For the...

8
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:59,740
For the purpose of simplicity in integrating the right-hand side, let's say f is also equal to 1 over the whole space.

9
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,300
But even though the solution is going to be non-trivial, because of...

10
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:09,940
For different geometry, the solution to this differential equation is going to have different shapes.

11
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:11,580
Right? Okay.

12
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,120
So what is the weak form? How do we derive the weak form of this equation?

13
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:18,300
We use...

14
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,480
We use the same...

15
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:28,540
Same methodology of multiplying a v with the differential equation.

16
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:33,420
And integrate over the whole domain.

17
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,440
That has to be equal to 0 for any v.

18
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:43,160
And we use integration by parts.

19
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:48,160
So v times the Laplacian, which is the divergence of gradient.

20
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,620
So we have the gradient of u.

21
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,500
Can be computed, can be...

22
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,200
Can be integrated by parts.

23
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,640
And what we get is...

24
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:04,480
This divergence operator is going to become a gradient operator on v.

25
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:05,760
Okay?

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,540
So we have a gradient of v, and the dot is still the same.

27
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,800
And the gradient of u is still here.

28
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,660
So this is integrated over dx.

29
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,200
If we have a boundary term...

30
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,880
The boundary term is going to be the normal of the boundary.

31
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,200
Dot with gradient of u times v.

32
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:29,720
But here, because we are having a u satisfying the zero boundary condition,

33
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,280
therefore our test function v should also satisfy the same zero boundary condition.

34
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,120
Because v represents a perturbation on u.

35
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,340
Okay.

36
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,340
So...

37
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,640
So the boundary term goes away because v is equal to 0.

38
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,040
And the remaining part is simply v times f.

39
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,560
So we have the gradient of v.

40
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,760
And the gradient of v is equal to 0.

41
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,720
So we have the gradient of v.

42
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,760
And the gradient of v is equal to 0.

43
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,800
And the gradient of v is equal to 0.

44
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,800
And now from this formulation, we can see that...

45
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,480
The first term, again, is a bilinear form.

46
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,000
Right?

47
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:10,320
And the bilinear form would be an integral of the gradient of u, dot product with the gradient of v.

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,760
Again, it is a symmetric bilinear form.

49
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,040
And the integral of v dot f, again,

50
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,280
is going to be a linear functional.

51
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:26,520
So let's write this as a of u and v.

52
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:33,560
In this case, it's integral over the domain gradient u dot gradient of v.

53
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,520
And l of v is equal to integration.

54
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,560
Let's substitute the...

55
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,000
Yeah, let's do...

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,400
Okay.

57
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,600
So v times f dx.

58
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,200
All right.

59
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,600
So what space are we in here?

60
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:05,240
In what space would you need to define u and v for the bilinear form and the linear functional to be well defined?

61
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,460
What linear space do we have to be in?

62
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,720
What functional space does u and v have to be in?

63
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,720
Each one again.

64
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,240
Exactly.

65
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:14,360
Exactly.

66
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:22,440
So u and v also has to be in each one because their respective derivatives has to be square integrable.

67
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:34,040
If I have the derivatives to be square integrable, then I can use Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to guarantee that the weak form is going to be finite.

68
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,060
Right?

69
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:44,240
The integral of the product of the gradients is less or equal to the product of the integral of the...

70
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,240
I mean, okay.

71
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:59,240
So this is less or equal to integration of grad u dot grad u half times integration of grad v dot grad v half.

72
00:04:59,240 --> 00:04:59,740
Right?

73
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,240
So that's...

74
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:12,240
And if each of these are bounded by the definition of the Sobolev norm, then my a u v is bounded, also called continuous.

75
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:12,740
Okay.

76
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,240
So that's...

77
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:13,480
Okay.

78
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:13,580
Okay.

79
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:13,640
Okay.

80
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:13,880
Okay.

81
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:13,940
Okay.

82
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,120
Okay.

83
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,200
Okay.

84
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:14,220
Okay.

85
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:14,340
Okay.

86
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:20,520
And the right-hand side is going to be bounded by just another Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

87
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,240
So this is...

88
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:32,900
So if f is well-defined, if f is also in L2, then I can bond this by that.

89
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:42,240
And this occasionally is also well-defined even if f is not a proper L2 function.

90
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:43,580
Okay.

91
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:43,640
Okay.

92
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,340
Any questions on the weak form?

93
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,740
So this is A and this is L for the two-dimensional Poisson's equation.
