1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,580
So first of all, finite element, it has a certain type of optimality in it.

2
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:15,860
In the sense it minimizes the so-called energy norm, if there is an energy norm.

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,880
Okay, so the energy norm, let's first define energy norm.

4
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:28,400
The energy norm is defined as AU of U.

5
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,980
Okay, when A is symmetric.

6
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:43,460
Okay, so the energy norm is only well defined for symmetric U,

7
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:47,460
which means A of U and V is the same as A of V and U.

8
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:58,320
And the energy norm is actually equivalent to whatever norm we,

9
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,180
we have the norm of U.

10
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:05,960
If the bilinear form A is coercive and continuous by equivalent,

11
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,180
what I mean is A of U and V is great,

12
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:18,440
is greater or equal to this B of A of U and U is equal to not,

13
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:28,380
not just B times the norm of U square and less or equal to C times the norm of U square.

14
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,220
So this is continuity.

15
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,520
This is coercivity.

16
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,600
Right?

17
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:49,580
So this is the, this is, this is the definition of two norms being, being equivalent.

18
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,400
So two norms being equivalent doesn't mean they give you the same numbers.

19
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,320
They just, they, they,

20
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:58,380
they give you the same numbers.

21
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,960
So two norms being equivalent can be used to bond each other.

22
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,720
If you know one norm is bounded, the other norm is bounded.

23
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,880
If you know one norm is not zero, the other norm is not zero.

24
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,460
That's what I mean by, by two norms being continuous.

25
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:10,500
Okay.

26
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:18,680
So the energy norm is, is defined just as the number that is produced by the bilinear function.

27
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:19,500
Right?

28
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:26,700
So why does finite element minimize the energy norm, minimize the error in the energy norm?

29
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,100
So let's look at,

30
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:32,780
let's look at the energy norm of the residual of the error in the finite element.

31
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,380
So U minus UH.

32
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,100
U minus UH.

33
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,900
And look at what it is.

34
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,580
Let's compare it with

35
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:57,340
A of the energy norm of the difference between U and the WH.

36
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:57,980
Find out.

37
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:10,580
So there's an arbitrary member of WH for another WH in the same lower dimensional space,

38
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,580
in the same finite dimensional space.

39
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:19,260
So here the difference is VH is specifically the solution of the finite element.

40
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:27,500
That satisfies the weak form for subset of these while WH is any function in the,

41
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,300
in the lower dimensional space.

42
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,260
So what we can do is the following.

43
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,900
A of U minus,

44
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,540
okay, what we can do is,

45
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,700
U minus WH,

46
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,180
U minus WH,

47
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:56,900
can be expressed as the summation of U minus WH.

48
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,900
This is using bilinearity U minus UH.

49
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,900
Plus A of U minus WH,

50
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,900
UH minus WH.

51
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,900
And let's see.

52
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:17,900
And let's take advantage of the fact that

53
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,900
A of U and UH minus WH,

54
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,900
can be expressed as the summation of U minus UH.

55
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,140
And let's take advantage of the fact that

56
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:25,900
A of U and UH minus WH,

57
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,100
minus WH,

58
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:35,380
is equal to L of U,

59
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:35,900
sorry,

60
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,100
L of UH minus WH.

61
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,900
So this is because UH minus,

62
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:46,420
this is because UH minus WH,

63
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,500
is a function, right?

64
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,380
So this is basically using the,

65
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,580
the fact that you satisfies the weak form.

66
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,740
And this,

67
00:04:54,740 --> 00:05:05,060
the same linear functional is also equal to u or a of uh uh minus wh right so this is using the

68
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:12,180
fact that uh is the solution of the finite element and it satisfies the weak form for any uh minus

69
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:19,940
wh which is in the lower dimensional space in the finite dimensional space so by using these two

70
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:30,580
the right hand side of the equation becomes a of u minus wh u minus uh plus

71
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:37,720
a of so that basically allows me to replace this u by uh

72
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:45,560
all right

73
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,420
good

74
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:58,100
okay so the next step is to basically apply the same trick to this term okay so

75
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:05,940
the next step is doing okay so let me write this down u minus wh

76
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:16,740
u minus uh can be written as a of u minus uh u minus uh

77
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:18,920
plus

78
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:23,940
so we already said uh so okay so first of all let's use the fact that a symmetric so also u of

79
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:27,220
u h u minus uh can be written as a of u minus uh u h minus wh

80
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:36,320
so we have we have basically the same thing

81
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:42,020
here except for when we have a financial hypothesis

82
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:46,980
and he has something else that he just can't and then we have something else okay which is this uh

83
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,740
호� by the empathy well before the необходsinality of the of the um Chi Ha wh

84
00:06:49,940 --> 00:07:00,180
we have uh uh here so this term can be written as uh let me write it down u minus uh u minus uh

85
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:07,460
this term can be written as again i can again from this from this analysis we can replace this u here

86
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:16,820
by by uh uh right so so this is actually equal to uh a of

87
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:28,980
uh minus wh zero because uh minus wh uh belongs to the lower dimensional space so this

88
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:37,220
bilinear form no matter for u or for uh would be equal to l of uh minus wh so this term is zero

89
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:37,460
yes

90
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:50,660
uh i think the first term is still there right yeah this other term is zero yes

91
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:58,820
right okay so what we have as a result of these two simplifications one simplification is

92
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:07,220
a manipulation of this term one is manipulation of this term it becomes uh that if i copy these

93
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:18,500
two here a of u minus wh u minus wh or the energy norm of u minus wh is going to be equal to so the

94
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:28,660
first term is going to become a of u minus uh u minus uh so that's from here the other term is uh

95
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:36,580
from from here right so plus this goes from here a of

96
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:48,820
uh minus wh uh minus wh so remember we have coercivity which means this bilinear form is

97
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:54,980
greater or equal to something squared to the norm of this guy squared so this has to be greater or

98
00:08:54,980 --> 00:09:05,300
equal to a of u minus uh u minus uh uh plus this coercivity constant

99
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:19,140
right uh minus wh squared so what we're seeing is that so this is uh so this is the error right

100
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:27,860
this is the error in the finite element solution and the error in the finite element solution

101
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:36,500
is the energy norm of the solution

102
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:42,840
of the error in the finite eminent solution is less or equal to

103
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,800
basically is the smallest, it's smaller

104
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,740
than the energy norm

105
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:55,740
of any other approximation of u within the same finite dimensional space

106
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,160
right so

107
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,120
right so this is a

108
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,500
if i

109
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,160
if i ignore this term, this term is always greater than zero so i can

110
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,180
i can keep

111
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:13,180
just drop this term and still have the greater or equal

112
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,080
for all

113
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,860
w

114
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:24,180
and we can see that the equality can only be obtained when u

115
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:29,060
minus w is zero

116
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,360
so not only

117
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,940
u has the

118
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,020
has the optimal error

119
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,040
in the energy norm

120
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:43,040
but it is the only member in the finite dimensional space that has that optimal error

121
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,280
alright

122
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:52,540
so finite element solution is the solution that optimizes, that minimizes the

123
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,460
approximation error

124
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:58,720
if the approximation error is expressed in terms of

125
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,320
the energy norm

126
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,720
and the energy norm is going to be specific to that bilinear form
