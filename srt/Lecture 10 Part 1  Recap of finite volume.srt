1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,700
Previously, we have discussed the proper way to solve conservation loss, that is, finite volume.

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:15,200
And we discussed what is the proper way to reconstruct the flux using only the cell averages.

3
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:22,120
In the beginning, we tried a central flux, which didn't work at all for shock waves.

4
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:30,800
Whenever we get a shock wave, we create wild oscillations if you just take the central flux approach.

5
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:41,780
And then we decided to use upwinding flux, which produced the correct behavior around shock waves,

6
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,900
but didn't always produce a physical solution.

7
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,620
And then we introduced the entropy condition.

8
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,620
The entropy condition says that...

9
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:59,620
the characteristic lines can run into discontinuities, but they cannot emerge from discontinuities

10
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:06,720
for physical reasons, because physically there is always an infinitesimal viscosity there

11
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:15,320
that is going to smooth out, that is going to expand any discontinuities where characteristics can go out of.

12
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,360
It will instantaneously make that discontinuity no longer a discontinuity.

13
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,100
While if you have a

14
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:31,780
characteristic running into a discontinuity, that counteracts with a very small amount of viscosity and maintains that discontinuity.

15
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:39,780
We discussed what is the proper way to solve equations and to get solutions that are physically correct.

16
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:45,420
That leads us to the derivation of the Godunov scheme.

17
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:52,020
Okay, the Godunov scheme looks at the correct flux.

18
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,260
At t plus epsilon.

19
00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:01,700
It solves a discontinuous problem for infinitesimal amount of time analytically.

20
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,460
And look at the flux after that infinitesimal amount of time.

21
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,500
And that is the correct flux to use.

22
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:19,660
Right, so these are what we discussed over the last lecture, but we found that all of this is going to only give us a first-order scheme.

23
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,940
So in this lecture, we are going to discuss

24
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:31,460
how do we get more than first-order schemes using the still, the physically correct numerical flux, the Godunov scheme.

25
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,260
The key to that lies in reconstruction.

26
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,900
Let's draw our solution as a function of x at a particular moment.

27
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,860
So infinite volume, we have the cell averages.

28
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:51,060
So let's represent the cell averages using piecewise constant lines.

29
00:02:52,100 --> 00:03:01,140
And it is exactly this piecewise constant solution that we used in our Godunov numerical flux in the last lecture.

30
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:08,900
We looked at this discontinuous solution over here and see how it will evolve after epsilon amount of time.

31
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,580
And what is the flux after epsilon amount of time at that interface.

32
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:20,580
The problem, the reason why it is only first order is not because of the way we are computing the flux,

33
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,940
but because of the way we are learning the flux.

34
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,940
We are looking at the solution.

35
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:28,260
We are reconstructing the solution only up to first order.

36
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,380
It's a piecewise constant reconstruction.

37
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:39,780
In this lecture, we will still use the same numerical flux, but reconstruct the solution in a more accurate way.

38
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,780
We want to produce a second-order reconstruction.

39
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:48,180
We want to produce a second-order reconstruction,

40
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,780
not just by connecting the two.

41
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,780
We want to reconstruct the two cell centers because if we do that,

42
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:00,820
we get back to our central flux scheme, which we know doesn't work for shock waves.

43
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:07,940
What we want to do is we want to reconstruct the scheme to second order

44
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:14,020
using only information from one side of the interface.

45
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:18,500
We want to extrapolate instead of interpolate.

46
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,900
So for example, if I'm looking at this interface,

47
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:25,700
if I'm looking at this interface over here,

48
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:36,180
I want to reconstruct the left-hand side of this solution by using only the cell averages over the left.

49
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:41,460
For example, I can produce a reconstruction by connecting these two centers,

50
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:46,500
and here is my reconstruction from the left.

51
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,700
I want to reconstruct information from the right using this information and this information.

52
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,100
For example, connecting these two dots,

53
00:04:54,100 --> 00:05:00,100
that will allow me to reconstruct a solution over here.

54
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:08,500
This is going to ensure that if the wave travels towards the right,

55
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:15,380
using good enough numerical flux is going to compute the flux according to the left-hand side solution here.

56
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:18,340
If the wave is traveling towards the left,

57
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,620
the good enough numerical flux is going to compute the flux using the left.

58
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,020
So we're still using the right-hand side solution here.

59
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:28,980
So we're still using the upwinding side of information,

60
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:35,220
which is physical, but we have a construction that is second order.

61
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:40,260
All right, so here I'm drawing a very discontinuous solution over here,

62
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:44,740
but if you imagine I'm doing the same reconstruction over here,

63
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,300
over a smooth region of the solution,

64
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,580
then I'm going to be doing a really good job

65
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,540
by connecting these two centers.

66
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,100
So if I connect these two, I get a solution here.

67
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,900
By connecting these two, I'm getting a solution here,

68
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,740
which really gets us a good reconstruction.

69
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,780
Okay, so this kind of extrapolation from only one side

70
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:09,300
gives us the correct behavior around shock waves

71
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:16,500
and a very accurate reconstruction in smooth regions.

72
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,980
Okay, so this is the approach we are going to be using here.

73
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:26,180
So we're using, we are constructing u,

74
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,940
so let's say this is the ith cell average,

75
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,220
this is the i plus 1 cell average.

76
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:41,380
We are going to reconstruct u at i plus half on the left,

77
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:48,900
using information on the ith grid point and i minus 1 grid point.

78
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,900
We are going to reconstruct

79
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,540
the solution at the same grid point,

80
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,620
but at the same interface,

81
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,660
but immediately towards the right of the interface,

82
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:05,220
using u i plus 1 and u i plus 2.

83
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,300
And my flux at i plus half is equal to,

84
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:17,140
let's imagine we write a function that computes the Godunov scheme.

85
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:20,020
That takes two inputs.

86
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,740
It takes the left value and the right value.

87
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:29,300
Both are reconstructed from two cell averages.

88
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:37,860
So I end up computing the flux using the four cells instead of two cells.

89
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:44,340
And that gives me a more accurate second order solution.

90
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:49,380
So how do we perform this reconstruction?

91
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:54,820
So the first step is what we are going to be discussing today.

92
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:55,380
Okay.

93
00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:03,060
The most obvious way of performing the reconstruction is a linear extrapolation.

94
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:08,580
So linear extrapolation means looking at the value at these two cell averages

95
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:13,060
and linearly extrapolate to here and linearly extrapolate to here.

96
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,500
So we can do that.

97
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,700
Unfortunately,

98
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,940
it is going to create

99
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:18,820
the solution.

100
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,780
The so-called

101
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,220
Gibbs phenomenon.

102
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:30,260
So Gibbs phenomenon is something you observe around discontinuities

103
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,980
where you have artificially,

104
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:37,460
you have artificial oscillations going on.

105
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:45,460
So the typical Gibbs phenomenon is when you should have a discontinuity like that,

106
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,460
you observe something like this.

107
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,660
So this is the so-called Gibbs phenomenon.

108
00:08:52,660 --> 00:09:05,780
And the reason you have this is because this reconstruction here and this reconstruction

109
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:11,700
here around any large discontinuities creates a large overshoot.

110
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,420
Overshoot and undershoot.

111
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,820
So this is the so-called Gibbs phenomenon.

112
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,300
Okay.

113
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:17,940
So this is the so-called Gibbs phenomenon.

114
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,140
So this is the so-called Gibbs phenomenon.

115
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:19,640
Right.

116
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:26,900
And this violates the correct behavior of a scalar conservation law,

117
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:32,660
which diminishes the total variation of the solution.

118
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,460
Remember the total variation?

119
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:42,100
The total variation is defined as an integral over a region a to b,

120
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:47,620
the absolute value of the derivative integrated over dx.

121
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:58,660
And numerically, it is equal to the summation goes from i to i1 to i2.

122
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:04,420
So this is summing over a range of grid points.

123
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:13,620
And instead of derivative, we have u of i minus u of i minus 1 taking the absolute value.

124
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:17,220
So this is the discrete analog of the total variation.

125
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:22,580
Instead of taking the derivative, you take the difference between two grid points.

126
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:27,540
And you can divide by delta x and multiply by delta x.

127
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,660
It's going to be the same.

128
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,900
It's a discretization of the total variation.

129
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,060
Right.

130
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:42,340
Just count how much change has happened when you walk through the sequence of grid points.

131
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:47,380
So we want this total variation to decrease monotonically.

132
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:52,260
At least not increasing when we time integrate the solution.

133
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:58,740
If we create this kind of overshoot when we reconstruct the solution,

134
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:05,620
then the total variation increases because I'm creating new extrema, new minimum, and new maximum.

135
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:09,540
I'm increasing and potentially increasing the local maximum

136
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:13,060
and decreasing the local minimum through the reconstruction.

137
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,500
And that's what we want to avoid.

138
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,220
Any questions of what we're doing?

139
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,340
Any questions of what we want to achieve?

140
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:23,460
Oh, it should not increase as you time integrate forward.

141
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:26,340
So the total variation, that's a good question.

142
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:39,380
So the criterion is the time derivative of the total variation is less or equal to zero.

143
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:45,460
So we want this to not increase over time, not as I decrease.

144
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,300
So that's the correct behavior for scalar.

145
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:50,420
So we want to avoid scalar conservation loss because in smooth regions,

146
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,260
the solution follows characteristics.

147
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:56,020
So any minimum or maximum is conserved.

148
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:02,580
If there is no discontinuities, the time derivative of our total variation should be zero.

149
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:03,940
Right.

150
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:11,540
Because the solution is morphed in shape, but it never changes its shape.

151
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:17,220
So any monotonically increasing regions, it's still going to be monotonically increasing.

152
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,740
It's just the bounds of the region are shifted over time.

153
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,260
Any monotonically decreasing regions are just shifted in space.

154
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,540
Yes.

155
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:30,500
So the question is, can you think of the Gibbs phenomenon in terms of the

156
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,020
newman stability analysis?

157
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:38,980
You can think of the Gibbs phenomenon as a result of dispersion error.

158
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:44,820
So dispersion error moves waves to incorrect places.

159
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,620
And this results in a new wave.

160
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,500
So dispersion error moves waves to incorrect places.

161
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,220
And this results in a new wave.

162
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,220
And this results in the oscillations over here.

163
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:56,580
And this is most obvious around shock waves because around shock waves,

164
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:59,620
you have very high frequency content of the solution.

165
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:06,180
So if you have dispersion error, you are moving these high frequency contents to wrong places,

166
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,740
to places away from the shock wave.

167
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:10,580
All right.

168
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:17,140
And also, most time when we have a discontinuity, that's when we have a nonlinear content.

169
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,140
So we have a nonlinear conservation law.

170
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,300
We have characteristics running into each other.

171
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:26,900
If you have linear conservation laws, all the characteristics are parallel to each other.

172
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:32,180
And you rarely have discontinuities that are as sharp as that.

173
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:39,900
So the objective in this lecture is to reconstruct the solution to second-order accuracy without overshooting.
