1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,020
Now I want to spend the last little time discussing what we can do with non-Numan

2
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:13,520
boundary conditions, what's called the natural boundary condition. So natural

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:18,760
boundary condition is quite interesting because it's something unique to finite

4
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:23,960
element. We don't have this infinite volume or finite difference. It turns out

5
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:32,320
what if I have a boundary condition that is du dx at 0 equal to 0? Okay, I still

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,640
have u1 equal to 0 being Dirichlet boundary condition. So I have

7
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:53,920
N on the left and Dirichlet on the right.

8
00:00:53,960 --> 00:01:03,960
So that is, I'm looking for solutions like that. On the left has to be flat and on the right it has to be equal to 0.

9
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:11,340
I'm looking for these kind of solutions. So let's use the Poisson's

10
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:18,960
equation as an example. So how should I deal with this kind of boundary conditions?

11
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,960
It turns out I don't need to do anything for this boundary condition.

12
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,100
That's why it is called a natural boundary condition.

13
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:33,960
What do I mean by I don't need to do anything? So to parameterize a function

14
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:45,380
like this, I need to define my x u to be all the functions f within a Sobolev

15
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:52,640
space and f1 is equal to 0. So I only need to enforce the right-hand side

16
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,340
boundary condition.

17
00:01:53,960 --> 00:02:04,780
Okay, and I'm going to define my x v to be the same as x u. So what happens is

18
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:13,520
that when I derive the weak form, the weak form is going to be integration of

19
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:23,860
a and b. v times the second order derivative of x plus a and b f times v.

20
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,660
Δ had b times 2 buses because all those Totals are in Koblenz.

21
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:31,340
So when Iع perform it with my partииo an the on the first term we no longer

22
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:38,240
because because we no longer have you Ovi to be equal to 0 on the left side

23
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:44,700
boundary we have to start considering the boundary terms at the left. It's no

24
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:51,020
longer going to be the same as what we have before. so when we integrate by

25
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,680
parts we get V times the

26
00:02:53,960 --> 00:03:04,480
derivative of u at so so when x equal to 1 we get when when x equal to 1 V is

27
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,860
equal to 0 so this is gone we only have this equal to 0 we have a minus sign

28
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:16,820
here minus the integration of partial V partial X partial u partial X DX plus

29
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:29,840
integration of F times V equal to 0 right okay so here this is what becomes

30
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:37,660
very interesting this has to be satisfied for any V whose value at the

31
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:43,840
left boundary can be anything right and in order for me to satisfy this for any

32
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,120
V

33
00:03:46,820 --> 00:04:04,740
this becomes 0 so so so for the solution u to satisfy the weak form for any V

34
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:16,460
that doesn't have to be 0 which can be anything at X equal to 0

35
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:16,800
right so this becomes 0 so so for the solution u to satisfy the weak form for

36
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:25,740
we have to have partial u partial X at 0 to be 0 so the bond the condition of

37
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:33,320
the derivative of u at the F-bond is equal to 0 comes naturally from the weak

38
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:39,960
form okay so that's why we call it a natural bond the condition it naturally

39
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:46,640
falls out of the weak form now perhaps we have a question

40
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:46,680
now perhaps we have a question

41
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,280
What if I want to enforce a Newman boundary condition that is not exactly equal to 0?

42
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,660
What if I want it to be 1?

43
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,560
How can I design it?

44
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,280
Does it still come naturally out of the weak form?

45
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:10,360
I can still make it come out of the weak form by modifying one term.

46
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,940
The term I need to modify is this.

47
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:31,080
So what if I set this not to be 0, but if I remove the 0 and add another term, that is v at 0.

48
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:45,060
Remember, we just discussed that the linear functional doesn't have to be the integral of a function times v.

49
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,260
It can also be.

50
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,460
The value of v at a particular point.

51
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:58,180
So in this case, what if I set the linear functional to be the summation of an integral with a known function and the value of v at a boundary?

52
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,740
What turns out to be is that we are going to have a v of 0 here.

53
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,680
And now v can be anything at 0.

54
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:14,480
Because the weak form has to be satisfied for any v within xv, which can be anything at x equal to 0.

55
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,660
So for this to be equal to 0, we have to do the same thing.

56
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:25,480
So if I do this, the derivative of u at x has to be, in this case, minus 1.

57
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:35,060
And of course, if I want the derivative to be plus 1, I just set this to be negative v.

58
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,440
And I have a negative v.

59
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,660
If I want the derivative to be 0.5, then it's negative 0.5 of v.

60
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:46,380
So by modifying just the weak form a little bit,

61
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:51,160
particularly the right-hand side of the weak form, which is the linear functional a little bit,

62
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,540
we can have the boundary condition naturally satisfied.

63
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,440
Remember, this is very different from the Dirichlet boundary condition.

64
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:04,680
The Dirichlet boundary condition, we actually modify the space of xu.

65
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:12,060
And we also reduce the dimension of the space xv to satisfy the boundary condition.

66
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:15,900
We actually force the solution u a priori.

67
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:20,380
And we also reduce the dimension of the space xv to satisfy that boundary condition.

68
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:24,380
Any possible solution that is in the space has to satisfy the Dirichlet boundary condition.

69
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,380
But for the Newman boundary condition, it's natural.

70
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,380
We only modify the weak form a little bit.

71
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:36,380
And it turns out the boundary condition is going to be naturally satisfied once the weak form is satisfied.

72
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:41,380
So these are two types of strategies for enforcing boundary conditions in finite element.

73
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:44,380
Yes, so I already got the weak form.

74
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,380
There is no problem.

75
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,380
No violation to the Poisson.

76
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,880
I mean, this is assuming.

77
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,160
So I can derive the weak form from the Poisson's equation.

78
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,640
Because if any solution satisfies the Poisson's equation, it also satisfies the weak form.

79
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,080
It's just the other is not true.

80
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:06,760
So if I have a function that satisfies the weak form, it doesn't have to correspond to any particular Poisson's equation.

81
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:12,080
I mean, if you try to derive it, you get something that is not a function on the right-hand side.

82
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,360
So I went through this procedure to derive the weak form.

83
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:23,380
It's just the boundary condition is going to fall out as an additional term on the right-hand side.

84
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:26,380
You can still do the same derivation.

85
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,380
You can still integrate by parts.

86
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:34,380
And we are still going to get the same form.

87
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:42,380
It's just that if we have a non-zero boundary condition, then this boundary term becomes something non-trivial.
