1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,880
So today we are going to introduce to you how do we solve system of equations.

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,440
System of equations is not just one differential equation but multiple

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,760
differential equations.

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:19,560
Okay so it's not that much different from solving one single differential

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,860
equation. For example, I'm going to motivate that using a very simple

6
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:35,820
example. Partial u, partial t plus I'm going to say u11 of partial u, partial x

7
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:45,800
plus u12 of partial v, partial x equal to 0 and partial v, partial t plus u21 of

8
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:52,680
partial u, partial x plus u22 of partial v, partial x equal to 0.

9
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:07,020
Right. So the only difference from our previous case is that every equation

10
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:12,680
involves another equation. The time derivative for u involves v and the time

11
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:20,260
derivative for v involves u. Right. So how do we solve it?

12
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,740
We just do exactly the same thing as we did in the previous example.

13
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:25,840
So we solve the equation, we just do exactly the same thing as we did in the previous example.

14
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:33,020
did before the UI DT would be equal to u11 for example if you want to use

15
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:42,940
central difference ui plus 1 minus ui minus 1 divided by 2 del x plus u12 v i

16
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:51,520
plus 1 minus v i minus 1 2 del x and this is the same so this is

17
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,860
discretization how do we perform error how do we analyze the truncation error

18
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:02,980
of the scheme same thing right so we basically plug in Taylor series on each

19
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:12,860
of these derivatives same thing the only difference is how to analyze stability

20
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:20,000
how do we know this is gonna be a stable scheme instead of being an unstable

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,280
scheme

22
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:32,240
right again we have two ways to analyze stability the simplest way I would say

23
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:37,560
is the what we discussed in the last lecture for Newman stability analysis

24
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:50,680
right but now in this case we have a little bit more complication because let's for example just

25
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,480
take this one

26
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:59,900
and use our Fourier Series and but in this case we need to expand the Fourier

27
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:12,020
Series both on u and v again K goes from minus n over 2 to n over 2 minus 1

28
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:17,060
because of the aliasing of the higher frequencies back to the lower frequencies

29
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:28,300
VI is going to be the same summation over the same range of Vk-hat, same explanation.

30
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:43,220
So if we plug this in, what we get is du-hat of k dt, which is a result of substituting

31
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:50,640
the Fourier series into the time derivative and collect the terms with regard to the same

32
00:03:50,640 --> 00:04:06,260
exponential of k, plus u11 of V-hat of k and the same thing as we did before is going to

33
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:13,040
come in, jk-delta-x minus e to the minus jk-delta-x divided by 2-delta-x.

34
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:13,120
.

35
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:18,860
This is actually going to be a common term also for V.

36
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:23,740
So u12, oh sorry, this one is u, this one is V.

37
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,280
And the same term.

38
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,680
Okay, and I'm just going to write down the same equation for V.

39
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:56,980
Now in this case, do we still have that very simple scalar ODE we can analyze the stability of?

40
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:05,240
We no longer, right?

41
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:12,120
We need to have a coupled ODE.

42
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,060
So we can...

43
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:13,120
.

44
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,140
.

45
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:13,180
.

46
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:13,200
.

47
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:13,320
.

48
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:13,340
.

49
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:13,360
.

50
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:13,400
.

51
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:13,460
.

52
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:20,240
We can only look at the time derivative of these two numbers at the same time.

53
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:31,720
This is actually going to be equal to a matrix times u-hat of k, V-hat of k.

54
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:38,480
And that matrix involves u11, u12, u21, u22.

55
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,480
It also involves the same vector.

56
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:59,660
factor, let me just write as, not k, but ck, where ck is equal to e to the jk delta x minus

57
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:03,800
e to the jk minus jk delta x over 2 delta x.

58
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,600
This is equal to 0.

59
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:15,100
So, in order to ensure that the scheme is stable, what do we need to ensure about this

60
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:15,920
whole matrix?

61
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,840
The norm is less than 1.

62
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,680
That is an excellent way to ensure the stability.

63
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:31,880
And another excellent way to ensure the stability is look at the eigenvalues.

64
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,720
Let's talk about it.

65
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,720
So, this is...

66
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:45,340
If I write it as d dt of u hat of k v hat of k is equal to, let's move this to the other

67
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:49,740
side, ak times the same vector.

68
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:56,140
What do we know about the solution to this equation?

69
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:05,640
The solution to this equation can be derived analytically by factorizing.

70
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,560
So, let's look at the solution to this matrix and its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

71
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:14,560
If we say ak is equal to...

72
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,560
What is...

73
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,260
What's the notation for the eigenvectors?

74
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:31,580
vk times lambda k times vk inverse.

75
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,640
Okay.

76
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,340
So, this is...

77
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:43,960
The vk is going to contain all the eigenvectors of the matrix.

78
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,840
Lambda k is going to contain all the eigenvalues of the matrix.

79
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,280
In this case, it's a 2 by 2 matrix.

80
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:58,800
Unless the two eigenvalues happens to be exactly the same, this lambda k is going to be a diagonal

81
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,280
matrix.

82
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:05,280
It has two diagonal entries corresponding to the two eigenvalues.

83
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,280
And that's what we call the method of linear operation.

84
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,060
We can call this the linear operation.

85
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,580
So, we can call the method of linear operation.

86
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,580
Okay?

87
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:17,380
And these eigenvalues are exactly ck because taking eigenvalue of a matrix is a linear

88
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,380
operator.

89
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:21,620
If you multiply the matrix by 2, the eigenvalues are multiplied by 2.

90
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:28,620
So, these eigenvalues are equal to ck times the eigenvalues of this u matrix.

91
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:35,180
So, in trying to ensure the scheme is stable, we have to put in the eigenvalues.

92
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:41,340
is stable you only need to compute the eigenvalues of that matrix and the scale these eigenvalues by

93
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:48,860
ck for different case so once you have that eigenvalue expansion what we can do is that

94
00:08:51,740 --> 00:09:02,060
we can multiply both sides by vk inverse so vk inverse d dt and by the way vk is not a function

95
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:08,540
i mean the matrix ak is not a function of t therefore the eigenvectors are also not a

96
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:14,380
function of t so once you multiply both sides by vk inverse we get that

97
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:31,660
and in particular let's define the transformed vks as u tilde k and v tilde k let's define them

98
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:31,980
as

99
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:43,900
vk inverse times u hat k and v hat k right so the reason we're doing this is to diagonalize

100
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:52,060
the differential equation is to decouple these coupled differential equations if we do this

101
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:58,300
what we have is ddt because this vk is not a function of time it can be taken

102
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,660
into the time derivative without modifying anything else

103
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:07,980
so we can just write down the matrix as u tilde k and v tilde k

104
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:14,140
so we have the first eigenvalue and the second eigenvalue let's just write down this matrix

105
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:20,060
like this times u tilde k v tilde k

106
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:28,620
we have zero and zero here that means these two variables

107
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,900
u tilde and v tilde of k they evolve independently

u tilde of k. d dt of v tilde of k is equal to lambda k2 times v tilde of k.

117
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:22,500
As long as these two eigenvalues lie in the stability region of whatever time

118
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:31,620
integration scheme we are using, we know we have a stable scheme. To summarize

119
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:37,260
if we want to ensure a spatial discretization is stable for a system of

120
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:48,660
equations, we first perform voluminos stability analysis, which means

121
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:54,780
substituting a discrete Fourier series into the into the discretized difference

122
00:11:54,780 --> 00:12:01,460
equation. And then for each wave number k, instead of deriving a single number

123
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:01,600
which is the consequential property tangent variance over k, the quadratic

124
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:07,120
determines the stability we are going to derive a 2x2 matrix if we have two

125
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,900
system of equations or a 3x3 matrix if we have three equations that is

126
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:17,400
coupled and we have one matrix for each K and we need to make sure that every

127
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:25,540
eigenvalue of every matrix associated with every K lies within the stability

128
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:35,080
region of the time integration scheme okay any questions what if we have

129
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,520
equal eigenvalues that's a very good question in the case we have equal

130
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:44,860
eigenvalues we need to make still want to make sure that equal eigenvalue lies

131
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:53,820
within the stability region of our time integration scheme what's a little bit

132
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,480
tricky is when

133
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:55,520
that

134
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:00,380
equal eigenvalue lies on the boundary of the stability region that's a lot more

135
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:10,460
complex case so we know like in when you have a when we have a single equation

136
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:14,720
not a system equation if we have eigenvalue lies exactly on the boundary

137
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,200
then we have a linear growth on the solution error and if you have a system

138
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,560
of equation and you have you have a duplicate eigenvalue lies on the

139
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,460
boundary it's a lot more complex case

140
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:30,900
but if every eigenvalue is within the the stability region then it's a you

141
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:35,140
still have the same property you still have found it still have bounded

142
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:43,380
solution error you need to make sure all the most K have all the landas falling

143
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,540
into the stability region

144
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:49,540
how do you ensure that this is the case

145
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,260
lambda ah lambdas are numbers

146
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,440
lambda are numbers

147
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,700
They are not functions.

148
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,820
So each lambda k1 and each lambda k2 is a number.

149
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:06,220
And k, remember, goes from minus n over 2 to n over 2 minus 1.

150
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,040
Right?

151
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,900
So what I would do in this case is to take this matrix, analyze,

152
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,060
take this u11, u12, u21, u22 matrix,

153
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,200
look at the eigenvalues of that matrix.

154
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:22,940
And we know the eigenvalues of the matrix ak

155
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:28,020
is equal to the eigenvalues of this matrix times the ck for different k's.

156
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:30,720
Okay?

157
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:37,740
So basically there are two classes of numbers we want to look at.

158
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,280
One is ck times the first eigenvalue of that matrix,

159
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,020
and also the second number is the ck's, different ck's,

160
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,280
multiplied by the second eigenvalue of the matrix.

161
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,200
If all of them, like I'm saying,

162
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,880
so you can plot them in the stability,

163
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,480
in the complex plane,

164
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,680
if all of them lies within the stability region, you are good.
