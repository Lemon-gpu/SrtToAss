1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,440
right no okay so F is equal to good enough of UI plus just copy and paste

2
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:22,920
UI plus half left UI plus half right I'm going to code up the good enough scheme

3
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:42,120
over here you L and you are okay so just to review our good enough scheme so the

4
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:49,340
flux is going to be taking either maximum or minimum depending on which you L or

5
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,760
you are is larger right

6
00:00:52,920 --> 00:01:01,780
so so let me just so when we are taking maximum or minimum for burgers flux

7
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:10,940
burgers it can only be taking three possible values it can either FL is

8
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:21,680
equal to UL square over 2 F right is equal to UR square over 2 or F mean is

9
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,880
equal to Z

10
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:29,620
right so so because when we are taking the maximum and minimum of the flux over

11
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:37,540
a range of U values and the minimum or maximum depending on which side of U is

12
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:44,060
going to be larger and because the burgers flux is U square over 2 it's a

13
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:49,100
convex function and because it's a convex function when whenever we are

14
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,820
taking the maximum the maximum can

15
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:59,360
it can only be possible on one of the ends it's either F left or F right

16
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:14,340
right so so burgers the floor is like this F as a function of U so whenever

17
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:19,500
we have a range of U taking the maximum over the range can either a go on this

18
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,720
side or this side

19
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:27,260
Well, taking the minimum can be different.

20
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:33,000
So if I'm taking the minimum over a monotonically increasing or decreasing region, the minimum

21
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,680
occurs on one side.

22
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:41,160
But if the range of U overlaps with U equal to zero, then the minimum actually happens

23
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,160
to be zero.

24
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,440
That's why I'm writing fmin is equal to zero here.

25
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,140
So several cases.

26
00:02:48,140 --> 00:03:01,200
So first, let me just say f is equal to zero's length of U .

27
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,180
Okay, length of U .

28
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:10,980
So I'm making a function of this length.

29
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:18,120
So f over the region of U is greater than U .

30
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:29,280
So when U is greater than U , should we take the minimum or maximum?

31
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:36,160
U greater than U , we should be taking the maximum, right?

32
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:43,380
So it is equal to, when we have a maximum, it doesn't matter, is it max or maximum in

33
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,380
MATLAB?

34
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,380
Max.

35
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,380
Max, okay.

36
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,380
Is f and f ?

37
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:47,880
Yes.

38
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,680
So f and f are.

39
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,560
Alright.

40
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:03,940
So this makes sense because when both are positive, when both are positive, so over

41
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:15,260
this region, over this region, so if I have U left, U ,

42
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,260
right?

43
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:25,680
I have a shockwave like that, and the flux should be taken on the left, which is U and

44
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,680
this is the maximum.

45
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,680
Okay, that's good.

46
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,680
Okay.

47
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:41,680
So f less or equal to U is going to be equal to the minimum of f and f .

48
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,680
And f less or equal to zero.

49
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,680
Okay.

50
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,680
So f less or equal to zero.

51
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,680
Okay.

52
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,680
So f less or equal to zero.

53
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,680
Okay.

54
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:58,240
So f less or equal to zero and U and the zero less or equal to U should be equal to

55
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,240
f .

56
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,240
So these are the three cases.

57
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,240
Right?

58
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,920
So this is the case when U is less than U , which means we should be taking the

59
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:14,800
minimum and that U and U overlaps with the region of zero.

60
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,920
And by taking minimum, we are not taking one side.

61
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:21,280
We are taking the minimum inside that range, which is zero.

62
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,160
So this is the Berger's Goodenow scheme.

63
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,680
Okay.

64
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,080
So let's try it.

65
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,660
I'm sure I still have box somewhere, but let's do it anyway.

66
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:38,980
So let's make a, okay, x interface.

67
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:42,700
Let's still use what we had in the last lecture.

68
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,760
X would be equal to the cell averages.

69
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:53,120
And U is equal to sine of x times two pi.

70
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,260
So x and U is still the same as what we have in the last lecture.

71
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,920
So that's good.

72
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,500
Let's make U zero equal to U again.

73
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:10,700
And let's use the DDT.

74
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,720
We call it Berger's.

75
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,520
We solve it for this much.

76
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,520
Okay.

77
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,520
So starting debugging.

78
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,520
Error in this.

79
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,520
Oh, A and B must be the same.

80
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:27,320
So it's actually the maximum of these within that range.

81
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:32,540
So it's max of this and min of this.

82
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,640
And here should be the same.

83
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:40,280
It should be FL of this and FR of that.

84
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,360
All right.

85
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,360
Let's try again.

86
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,360
Okay.

87
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:56,920
Oh, so here, if I go back up to here, return the vector of length 1 0 1.

88
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,000
Oh, I see.

89
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,540
Okay.

90
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:03,360
So here we actually computed i plus half.

91
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,360
So we shouldn't have this anymore, right?

92
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,880
So because we only need i goes when, so for i plus half, we need, it goes from minus one to n.

93
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,360
Do this again.

94
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,000
we have a solution. So let's look at it.

95
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,200
Plot x u.

96
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,880
Right. So that way we, so you see

97
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,820
something different from what we got in the last lecture, right?

98
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:31,740
So we no longer, on the same grid, we no longer

99
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:36,220
see the minimum of this decaying as the wave propagates

100
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:40,180
towards the right. So that's the good thing about

101
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:43,960
a second order accurate scheme. That is, when we have the wave

102
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,240
going, we no longer, in smooth regions, we no longer have that much

103
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,740
dissipation error. The maximum of the solution no longer

104
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:55,520
seems to decrease over time.

105
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,060
We no longer see this weird gap over here.

106
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,440
And just to remind you what we have before,

107
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,300
the easiest case is to set phi

108
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,160
is equal to zero. So that's our

109
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,120
first order scheme.

110
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,400
And plot this again.

111
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:23,000
What we have is this curious gap over here

112
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,900
that it decreases the maximum of the solution and

113
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:31,000
increases the minimum of the solution. And by having

114
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,280
a proper

115
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:38,020
limiter, we no longer have that.

116
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:42,020
Alright, so previously we have a case that violates,

117
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,320
so if we set phi equal to zero, we

118
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,320
violate the condition that phi has to be,

119
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,560
we violate

120
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:58,320
the condition that, this page I think, ph has to be

121
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,320
greater than this black line.

122
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,700
So for example, if we try another,

123
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:13,620
if we try like your proposal what's your name again if I try Mike's proposal

124
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:22,980
which violates the second condition that is that is instead of setting fee to

125
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:28,080
this we set fee of everything is equal to one except for in the region of our

126
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,980
less than zero right basically we are violating I think we are violating the

127
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:40,640
met the monotonicity of total variation condition it's still gonna be second

128
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:49,160
order but if we look at the solution here it looks good but like if you see

129
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:56,780
MATLAB is a it's a smart thing whenever you have a solution exceed the one and

130
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:03,740
minus one it rescales the screen so that like it looks like you have let's let's

131
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:03,960
zoom in a little bit and see if we can see the difference between the two so

132
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,460
it's a smart thing whenever you have a solution exceed the one and minus one it

133
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:12,760
actually see this so you see that the solution has peaks now that exceeds the

134
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:17,580
the value one so it is not monotonically decreasing the total

135
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:24,420
variation all right but the solution is still second-order accurate so so the

136
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:31,080
proposal is not too bad and over over this region it actually damps down the

137
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,800
shockwave and doesn't it doesn't create wild or

138
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:49,800
the

139
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:55,580
everywhere because it's actually using information from the wrong side okay so

140
00:10:55,580 --> 00:11:03,720
so this lecture we discussed how to solve scalar conservation loss in one

141
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:03,800
way or another so we're going to go through the whole thing and we're going to

142
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:03,920
go through the whole thing and we're going to go through the whole thing and

143
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:09,680
one dimension but now we have going to second order schemes okay so this

144
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:09,700
one dimension but now we have going to second order schemes okay so this

145
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:14,500
finishes our discussion on solving scalar conservation loss on one

146
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:19,300
dimensional domain and in the rest of final volume we are going to say we're

147
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:24,360
going to see how do we extend this type of techniques to more than one

148
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:29,200
dimensions and it turns out extending this to more than one dimensions is very

149
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,680
straightforward even for very complex unstructured mesh

150
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,100
straightforward even for very complex unstructured mesh
