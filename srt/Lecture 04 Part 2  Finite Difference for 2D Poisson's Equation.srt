1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,280
Alright, so find a difference approximation of the 2D Poisson's operator,

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:12,160
the 2D Laplace operator. The Laplace operator is basically the partial

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:19,880
square over partial x square plus partial square over partial y square. It

4
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:26,920
appears a lot in mathematics, particularly in differential equations.

5
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:35,560
So this is just a summation of two one-dimensional differential operators.

6
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:44,080
The first dimension is in x, the second dimension is y, right? And remember in the

7
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:49,860
1D case, the second derivative of u can

8
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:56,840
be approximated by u of i plus 1 plus u such as i minus 1 plus 2u x divided by

9
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:05,480
delta x squared, and we used Taylor's series analysis to either derive this or

10
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:12,700
analyze its order of accuracy, and just to remind order of accuracy means as

11
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:19,480
Delta x goes to zero how fast does the area of this approximation go to zero.

12
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,920
and do we remember what is the order of accuracy of this scheme?

13
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:30,680
It's second order, which means the truncation error,

14
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,200
the error of this approximation,

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,020
scales like delta x squared.

16
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,340
If it scales like delta x, it's called first order.

17
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,860
If it scales like delta x cubed, it's called third order.

18
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,360
All right, so this operator is second order.

19
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,200
The truncation error, left minus right,

20
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,020
scales with delta x squared,

21
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,380
a constant times delta x squared.

22
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,620
Now in 2D, we can do the same thing.

23
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,840
Okay, we can do the same thing.

24
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,880
The partial square u, partial x squared,

25
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,340
plus partial square u,

26
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,780
partial y squared.

27
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,740
Now we have more than the index i.

28
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:27,540
We have ui plus 1 and j

29
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,580
plus ui minus 1 and j.

30
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,240
So they are taking the finite difference operator

31
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,820
at the same j to approximate the x derivative.

32
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:40,320
Okay.

33
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,700
And we also add this up with

34
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,660
ui of j plus 1 plus ui of y plus 1.

35
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,620
So we have ui of j minus 1 minus 2 uij divided by now delta y squared,

36
00:02:54,440 --> 00:03:00,460
where delta x is the distance between two adjacent x grid points.

37
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,820
And delta y is the distance between two adjacent y grid points.

38
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,240
All right.

39
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:15,140
So now we have an approximation to this operator.

40
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:15,260
So,

41
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,180
if,

42
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,980
I have the Poisson's equation,

43
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,920
which means this is equal to f.

44
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,100
Okay.

45
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,380
That means,

46
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,500
let me write approximation.

47
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:33,860
That means this finite difference operator can be equalized to f of ij.

48
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,520
So this equation,

49
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,660
which means,

50
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,320
which,

51
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,500
which is written out as a linear combination of,

52
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:56,540
of five different values of u at five grid points is equal to fij.

53
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,820
So let's say this is,

54
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,860
if this is ij under consideration,

55
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,400
okay,

56
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:14,400
the value of f at these grid points is equal to a linear combination of ui plus 1j,

57
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,120
which is this point.

58
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,160
This is ui plus 1j.

59
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,380
Right?

60
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,600
Ui minus 1j,

61
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,440
these grid points minus two uij.

62
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,560
So this grid points and uij plus one,

63
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,300
that's here.

64
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,260
Uij minus one,

65
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:33,980
that's here.

66
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,860
And uij again is here.

67
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,900
So we have five,

68
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:46,880
we have five grid points and five different coefficients to multiply with the u at these grid points.

69
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,240
Add them together,

70
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,340
Add them together,

71
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:54,340
they should equal to F at the center grid points. And the same equation should

72
00:04:54,340 --> 00:05:05,500
apply to every single interior grid point, right? So if we have nx minus 1

73
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:12,280
interior grid points in X, we have n y minus 1 interior grid points in Y. This

74
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:19,280
is not a single equation. This is nx minus 1 times n y minus 1 equations.

75
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:28,540
Okay? Again, how many unknowns do we have? If we know the boundary conditions u of i,

76
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:41,020
j equal to 0, if i is equal to 0, or i is equal to nx, or j is equal to 0, or j is

77
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,020
equal to ny.

78
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:42,120
Okay?

79
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,180
So if we have this boundary condition, the simplest type of boundary condition,

80
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,360
how many unknowns do we have?

81
00:05:54,860 --> 00:06:06,260
Exactly. So this gives us nx minus 1 times n y minus 1 equations for the same

82
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,220
number of unknowns.

83
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:20,100
Okay? And all these equations are linear equations, right? So by this finite difference

84
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:25,880
approximation of the 2D Laplace operator, we converted the partial differential equation

85
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:32,240
into a set of linear equations that uniquely, that combines with the boundary condition,

86
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,080
I need to say, uniquely determines the numerical solution.
