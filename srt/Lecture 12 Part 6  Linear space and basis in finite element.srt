1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,420
When we are performing a minimization, we are performing it over all possible functions that satisfies a certain criterion.

2
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:12,280
And these all possible functions is what we call the space.

3
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:20,120
And here I'm going to give two examples of that space over here.

4
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:28,080
So the first example is x is the space.

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,760
And the space is a set of functions.

6
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,440
It's a collection of functions that satisfy a certain criterion.

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:53,440
For example, is f of x between 0 and 1 such that for all i.

8
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,720
Okay.

9
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,060
So for all the i.

10
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:07,040
We are still representing the space using a finite number of intervals.

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,360
And these intervals are now what we call elements.

12
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:19,820
And for reasons I'm going to discuss a little bit later, let's now, instead of labeling the elements as integers,

13
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,700
let's label the element boundaries as integers.

14
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,080
1, 2, 3, 4, etc.

15
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:28,040
So for all the i's.

16
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,080
Let's see.

17
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:42,440
fx is linear in x in xi minus 1 and xi.

18
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,720
Okay.

19
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,200
So this is one class of functions.

20
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,440
So can somebody tell me does this correspond to this case or the previous case?

21
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,740
This one, right?

22
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,040
Because.

23
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:02,440
Because I'm no longer requiring my x to be continuous.

24
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,580
So.

25
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:13,640
So for example, when i is equal to 1, when x is in x0 and x1, the function is linear like this.

26
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,760
In between 1 and 2, the function can be like that.

27
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,280
Okay.

28
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,760
So I can have a function that is like that to approximate whatever function I want to approximate.

29
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,880
The second case, which is the case we're going to discuss in this lecture.

30
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:33,760
Is putting an additional constraint on the function.

31
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,720
And f is continuous.

32
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,240
Continuous.

33
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:54,080
And for all the i, fx is linear.

34
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:56,880
In x.

35
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,280
x.

36
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,960
i minus 1 and xi.

37
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,760
So this is a space that I require the function to be not only piecewise linear but continuous.

38
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,120
So these are these kind of piecewise lines that I can draw with one stroke.

39
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:17,940
Okay.

40
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:20,860
Now.

41
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,280
What I claim is that this space of x satisfies a particular.

42
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,280
Particularly nice properties called linearity.

43
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,280
So what does linearity mean?

44
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:40,280
Linearity means that if I have x1 and x2 both in the space x.

45
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,280
Okay.

46
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,280
So linearity.

47
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:50,280
So this is not linearity of the function but linearity of the function space.

48
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,280
Right.

49
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,280
That's different from the linearity of the function f.

50
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,280
Linearity of the function f just says like f is a straight line.

51
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,280
If you put it like this.

52
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,280
You plot it.

53
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,280
But linearity of the function space is something different.

54
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:06,280
It's saying that for any pair of f1 and f2 in that linear space.

55
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:20,280
a1 times f1 plus a2 times f2 is also in the space for any real numbers a1 and a2.

56
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,280
Alright.

57
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,280
So.

58
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:31,280
Any linear combination of any two elements in the space also belongs to the same space.

59
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,280
That is linearity.

60
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,280
So in this case why is the case?

61
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,280
Why is this particular space linear?

62
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,280
So let's check it.

63
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,280
First of all if I have a function like that.

64
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,280
If I scale the function by a real number.

65
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,280
The scaled function.

66
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,280
Let's say if I scale it to a little bigger.

67
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,280
The scaled function would look like that.

68
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,280
Of course it's still continuous.

69
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:03,280
And of course for every interval the scaled function is also linear.

70
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,280
Right.

71
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,280
So if I have f1 in x.

72
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,280
a1 times f1 is also in x.

73
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,280
Again if I have f2 in x.

74
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,280
a2 times f2 is also in x.

75
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,280
This is pretty much linear.

76
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,280
This is because scaling is invariant.

77
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,280
Scaling is.

78
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,280
I mean the x is invariant to scaling.

79
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:33,280
And also if I have both a1 f1 and a2 f2 in the space.

80
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:39,280
Adding them together the sum of two continuous functions is continuous.

81
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,280
And the sum of two linear functions is linear.

82
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,280
So.

83
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,280
a1 f1 plus a2 f2 is also.

84
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,280
Continuous and piecewise linear.

85
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,280
Therefore we can prove that x is a linear space.

86
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,280
By simply arguing about the properties of the functions.

87
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,280
It has to satisfy.

88
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,280
Alright.

89
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:07,280
Any questions so far?

90
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,280
Okay.

91
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,280
Now.

92
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,280
We need to introduce the concept.

93
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,280
Once we have a linear space.

94
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,280
A linear space is particularly nice.

95
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:26,280
That it has this thing called a basis.

96
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,280
Okay.

97
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:33,280
A basis in a linear space.

98
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,280
x1 x2 all the way to xn for example.

99
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,280
Is a basis.

100
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,280
So this is a basis.

101
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:56,280
Of x.

102
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,280
If and only if.

103
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,280
The following properties are satisfied.

104
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,280
So first of all.

105
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,280
For any x.

106
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,280
In that linear space.

107
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,280
X can be represented as a linear combination.

108
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,280
Of these basis.

109
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,280
Alright.

110
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,280
So this is the first property.

111
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,280
But that's not the case.

112
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,280
Because.

113
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,280
The first property.

114
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,280
Is the linear space.

115
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,280
And the second property.

116
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,280
Is the linear space.

117
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,280
And the third property.

118
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,280
Is the linear space.

119
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,280
And the fourth property.

120
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,280
Is the linear space.

121
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,280
So this is the first property.

122
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,280
But that's not enough.

123
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,280
Another property is that.

124
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,280
For any.

125
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,280
Another property.

126
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,280
Let me just say like this.

127
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,280
Another property is that.

128
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,280
This representation.

129
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,280
Is unique.

130
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,280
So.

131
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,280
For any x.

132
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,280
The.

133
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,280
The set of.

134
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,280
A i's.

135
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,280
Is.

136
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,280
A x.

137
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,280
And a x.

138
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,280
Is.

139
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,280
A x.

140
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,280
And a x.

141
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,280
Is.

142
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,280
A x.

143
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,280
And a x.

144
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,280
Is.

145
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,280
A x.

146
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,280
And a x.

147
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,280
Is.

148
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,280
A x.

149
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,280
Is.

150
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,280
A x.

151
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,280
Is.

152
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,280
A x.

153
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,280
Is.

154
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,280
A x.

155
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,280
And a x.

156
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,280
Such that.

157
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,280
A x.

158
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,280
Is.

159
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,280
A x.

160
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,280
Is.

161
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,280
A x.

162
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,280
Is.

163
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,280
A x.

164
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,280
Is.

165
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,280
Such that.

166
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,280
X.

167
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,280
Is.

168
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,280
E.

169
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,280
Equal to.

170
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,280
A i.

171
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,280
X.

172
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,280
I.

173
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,280
So.

174
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,280
This is i.

175
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,280
Is.

176
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,280
Unique.

177
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,280
So you can't find.

178
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,280
Two.

179
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,280
Different.

180
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,280
Set of.

181
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:21,900
clues you from having a basis in which xn can be represented as a linear

182
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:30,440
combination of x1 x2 to xn-1. Because if you can do that, xn is of course a

183
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:39,280
member of x, right? And then xn has two different representations. One

184
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:44,760
representation is that xn is equal to a summation where all the a i's are zero

185
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:51,300
except for a n which is 1. So xn is equal to xn. And also it has a different

186
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:56,640
representation using only the values x1 to xn-1. So the

187
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:03,020
representation of a summation of a i is not unique, right? So basically if we

188
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:08,520
have property 2 that means any members of the basis cannot be represented as a

189
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,140
linear combination of the other members.

190
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,040
Okay.

191
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:25,180
Also it means if we have a basis we cannot add anything onto the basis. So if

192
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:30,140
we add any other members of x onto the basis it becomes no longer a basis.

193
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:37,760
Because if we add another member that that additional member would be able to

194
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,600
be represented either just as a linear combination of itself or as a linear

195
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,600
combination of the previous set of basis.

196
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,760
Okay.

197
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:54,760
Any questions so far?

198
00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:02,980
So the basis is very useful because it reduces an optimization problem. It reduces a least

199
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:09,520
squares problem just like what we saw before. From a least squares problem in the abstract

200
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,680
function space to a least squares problem that a computer can solve.

201
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,680
Okay.

202
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,680
So that's the basic.

203
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,680
Thank you.

204
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,680
Thank you.

205
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,560
Thank you.

206
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:22,640
So but we'll have to think about how to solve a least squares problem in a bunch of

207
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:29,140
numbers. So for example if I want to say I want to minimize the distance. We're going

208
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:34,560
to define what the distance should be before or a little bit later. Between the distance

209
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:41,680
between any function f and x for all x in the linear space, x. Right so if we want to solve that minimization problem.

210
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,680
Right so if we want to solve that minimization problem.

211
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,680
Right.

212
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:52,800
minimization problem. It's pretty tricky because I'm minimizing over a function space that I don't

213
00:10:52,800 --> 00:11:02,560
know how to choose. But I can transform that minimization problem because any x in x can be

214
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:10,040
represented as a linear combination. I can minimize over all the possible a's that is in Rn,

215
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:21,000
right? So if the basis has n entries, the distance between f and that linear combination

216
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:32,500
of xi. So I know I'm minimizing over a space of n numbers, and that is something I can solve

217
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:39,700
with the computer. So that's why basis is useful, okay?

218
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:45,720
Now let's discuss... Yeah?

219
00:11:45,720 --> 00:12:02,360
That's a good question. What if the basis is not finite? Actually, for some function spaces,

220
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:09,560
the basis is infinite. For example, you can simply choose x to be all functions that are

221
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,020
continuous. So if you have a function space that is infinite, and you want to write it as a linear

222
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:15,100
continuous, it don't require x to be piecewise linear or anything. In that case, you actually

223
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:20,880
cannot find a finite set of basis. You can still have a basis, but the basis is going to be an

224
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:27,580
infinite set. It's not a finite set. And in that case, this particular problem cannot be transformed

225
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:34,340
into a finite dimensional optimization problem. That is why in finite element, there is this word

226
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:39,540
finite, okay? We need to construct...

227
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:47,460
Because the space of functions, as you can see, it's of my choice. I can choose what function space

228
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:56,060
I want to operate in. Therefore, I need to choose a function space that I can actually construct

229
00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:03,520
a finite set of basis. And that enables me to transform any minimization problem. So this is

230
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:09,500
just for approximating a function, a known function. I'm going to tell you a little bit later, like,

231
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:15,800
how to do the same for approximating an unknown function, which is a solution for PDE using the same

232
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:21,920
framework. We are also going to be able to translate that into a finite dimensional optimization problem.
