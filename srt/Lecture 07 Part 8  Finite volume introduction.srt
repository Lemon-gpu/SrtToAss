1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,880
So remember in our finite difference if we draw a function we are discretizing

2
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:19,260
the function by storing the values of the function at the grid points and then

3
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:25,840
we use Taylor series a manipulation that is intrinsically differential to

4
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:32,200
approximate the differential operators just using these points now you should

5
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:43,000
understand finite volume in finite volume if I draw the same function I do

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,140
a function like that

7
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,560
if I draw a similar function

8
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:09,800
this is what I have in the computer what I have is the average over these finite

9
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:16,060
volumes these are intervals in 1D but they are going to be truly volumes in 3D

10
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:21,460
they are areas in 2D they are the average values of the function inside these

11
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:22,460
volumes

12
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:25,460
why is that?

13
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:34,000
the case well two things one is that now I'm really representing the function I

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,140
have a complete form of the function but piecewise constant and

15
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:46,240
that form actually does respect that the function can be discontinuous

16
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,960
right actually it even represents a continuous and smooth function as

17
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,120
piecewise discontinuous functions

18
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:04,640
and I think that is perfect in there and there we are all set thereÄ« governed by

19
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:17,360
linear

20
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,920
series

21
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:24,040
all right let's see if you done that

22
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,000
did you mix them up well let's try actually show the difference I'm gonna try to show

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:35,760
volume averages, how does it relate to one of the forms we discussed?

24
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,380
It does relate to only the integral form.

25
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:48,400
Because if you look at the integral of the value over a and b, and think of this a and

26
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:56,400
b as the boundary of one of the intervals, how does the integral relate to the average

27
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:03,160
over the interval?

28
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,820
So how does average relate to the integral?

29
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:11,220
What is the correct way to average a function over a continuous domain?

30
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,220
Yes?

31
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:16,500
Just the integral of the function over the x?

32
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,900
Over the domain size, yes.

33
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:23,140
Just the integral of the function over the size of the domain is just the value, is the

34
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:28,660
average, is the mathematical definition of the average of the function over that small

35
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,140
interval.

36
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:37,740
So it is a direct representation, not even an approximation.

37
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:47,740
This is exact, that the left-hand side infinite volume can be exactly written as the time

38
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:53,980
derivative of the volume size, which is constant, times the volume average.

39
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,520
Right?

40
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:12,300
So d dt of u dx is exactly equal to the size of the volume, b minus a, times d u bar a b

41
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,300
dt.

42
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:13,980
And this u bar over a and b is exactly what we saw.

43
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:14,980
So we can write the derivative of the volume size, which is constant, times the volume

44
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:15,980
average.

45
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:16,900
Right?

46
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:21,140
This is exactly what we saw in the infinite volume.

47
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,940
Okay?

48
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:27,500
Now what are we missing to get the derivative?

49
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,080
This is equal to flux at a minus flux of b.

50
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,020
Right?

51
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:43,140
We need to somehow compute the flux of the function at the left and right of each interval,

52
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:47,140
at the boundaries of these discrete small volumes.

53
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:55,520
And we actually don't have the information here, because if you look at the continuous

54
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,820
function, the value of the function is here.

55
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:05,980
And the flux can be computed by evaluating the flux function, which is an analytic function,

56
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:09,180
at this value of u, which is last.

57
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,180
We only know that the value is somehow at the end of the function.

58
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,180
So we can write the derivative of the function at the end of the function.

59
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,180
And we can also compute the flux function at the end of the function.

60
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:17,420
It's somehow in between this average and this average.

61
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,940
We don't know what the value is.

62
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:24,940
Is that necessary to know that the very next interval is not in between the two?

63
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,940
Exactly.

64
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:30,240
That may not even be true, because over the next interval, the value of the function at

65
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,360
the interval is right here.

66
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:39,400
It lies even outside the range of the left domain average and right domain average.

67
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,220
So the final volume involves the flux.

68
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,220
So the final volume involves the flux.

69
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,160
So the final volume involves the flux.

70
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,200
So the final volume involves the flux.

71
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,200
So the final volume involves the flux.

72
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,200
So the final volume involves the flux.

73
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,420
And it involves approximation not on the differential operator, but on the function itself.

74
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:57,540
You have to somehow interpolate the function, not in the classical sense of interpolating

75
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,580
from some points to some other points.

76
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:06,420
It is interpolating the function from the averages of the function over domains to values

77
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:09,940
of the function on the domain boundaries.

78
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:10,940
To the limit, to the extension.

79
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:11,940
OK.

80
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,940
to the pointwise values is the approximation

81
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:19,940
we need to invoke in a finite volume approximation

82
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,360
for solving differential equations.
