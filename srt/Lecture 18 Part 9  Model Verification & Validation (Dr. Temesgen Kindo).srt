00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So when you are talking about verification and validation, there are two topics, right?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
There is the validation, which is, are we solving, is the equation actually representing the physics?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This isn't something a software can decide or a numerical system can decide.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's something you decide based on your experiments or something physical.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Whereas the verification is, am I solving that equation accurately?

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So basically you go from a physical model to a mathematical model to a numerical solution or to an analytical solution.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So the verification part is, did I make the right transition from the physical model to a PDE or a mathematical model?

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
But what we focus now is the verification, the last step.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And that we compare with exact solution, with benchmark solutions.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
But what we can do is when you don't have exact solution, when you don't have experimental data,

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
there is this thing called the method of manufactured solution.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It's pretty cool. Actually, I was very psyched when I first found out about it when I was doing the grad school project.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Google is method of manufactured solution.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
There is a big document from the Sandia National Lab that explains every detail.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
They use it for their nuclear testing.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So the idea is maybe this equation is nonlinear or coupled, so you don't really know how to derive an exact solution.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You assume a solution.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You start with a solution.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You start with an assumed solution.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You're going to say, hey, let's assume U is equal to this in terms of F and in terms of whatever space and time.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You make that assumption.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Now, plug it into the ODE.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
What do you get?

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Into the PDE.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
If you plug it into the PDE, you get a source term.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And then if you evaluate that solution at the boundaries, you get boundary condition.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And if you evaluate that at T is equal to zero, you get initial conditions.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Now, what you are going to ask is, if I now take this source term, initial condition,

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
and boundary condition that I derived out of the assumed solution and put it into my numerical solver,

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
will it give me back the assumed solution?

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Do you get the idea?

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And here, the only thing is that you should assume uniqueness of your solution, right?

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
If within a certain boundary condition and initial condition you can have multiple solutions, this may not work.

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
But otherwise, it's a very convenient way of testing.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So, the homework problem is in the booklet, Comsolve Mathematics, you got that on Monday, maybe?

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Let me give you a booklet with exercises.

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:49,000
There, there is this exercise, the BASMA exercise, where in that case, you are going to solve it using the Newton physics interface.

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
There in the booklet, it gives detailed instruction about the BASMA exercise.

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
There is also a section about using the electric current and the heat transfer.

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And then for the coupling, to use the electromagnetic heat source to model this.

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Your homework is to do that problem using equation-based modeling.

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Using PDs directly, not using heat transfer or multi-physics.

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So first, you know you can click on this physics and see what the equation is.

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So find the equations from there and the boundary conditions from that booklet.

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Then, solve it using PD interface.

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So basically, two PDs and then you need to couple them.

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So you need to know what the equation for the joule heating is and add it.

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Is the exercise clear?

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yes?

50
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Could you send us a soft copy of the booklet? I don't think everyone has got it.

51
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Okay, if you haven't, I will ask Mian to send you a soft copy for everyone.

52
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Who wants a hard copy?

53
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The last guy there, great to be signed.

54
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Any questions? Anything all clear?

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Alright, thank you for coming.

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Do you all write your names in here?

57
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Do you sign in?

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Anybody who didn't sign in?

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
