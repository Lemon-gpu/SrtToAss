1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,200
very good and now let's try to use this to solve the Poisson's equation okay so

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:18,840
so now we have these basis functions and remember in Poisson's equation we have

3
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:28,600
the AIJ's being the integration of the derivative of a pair of basis functions

4
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:41,980
plus a boundary term right and in particular we are if we have the zero

5
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:51,880
delicious boundary condition so if we know you and zero is equal to u at 1

6
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:58,160
equal to 0 what do we know about these linear combination coefficients

7
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:11,200
so if we want to if we want to represent a u of X equal to summation of I goes

8
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:22,000
from 0 to n ui of phi i of X we know that the first term can be 0 can be

9
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,220
removed from this linear combination and the last term can be removed from the

10
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,560
linear combination right

11
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:36,060
so essentially the effect of the this particular boundary condition is

12
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:44,280
reducing the dimensionality of the linear space it reduces the first and

13
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:51,160
last basis to be redundant right you don't need any contribution from the

14
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,820
base first basis and you don't need any contribution from the last basis or

15
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:58,600
equivalently you can eliminate these two functions from the linear combination

16
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:05,360
so basically we have the basic set so then we basically instead of I goes from

17
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:15,000
0 we have I goes from 1 to n minus 1 right so that removes two basis functions

18
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:27,040
two basis functions

19
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,980
ok now why not

20
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,660
we remove theses basis functions we only

21
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:42,240
have the interior head functions whose whose values are 0 at both X and

22
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:52,460
x equal to 0 and x equal to 1 so so the so the boundary terms the boundary terms

23
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:57,420
we have phi j times the derivative of phi i at 0 and 1 is equal to 0 and 1 hier boat

24
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:57,940
okay so here we are finding the MAS EST Nash V if we let the variation go from 0 to n you will see that the derivative fromostic解 from 0 and it can play off to the term with the difference in and if the asking which branch row average is equal to 1 and x which one mimic whose values represent the finals whose values are at 0 andasion equals to zero and x equals 1 so we now set a boundary conditions to equal to 0.

25
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:02,420
is equal to 0 for all the interior points for the all the interior basis

26
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:14,800
functions right for for J equal to 1 all the way to M minus 1 C J times the

27
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:26,440
derivative of C I to X is equal to 0 so we have a I J is equal to integration of

28
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:39,260
V I DX and the derivative of V J DX so we only have a I J equal to that we also

29
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:55,980
have B J equal to no derivative just the P J times F DX okay so let's figure out

30
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:56,420
what the derivative of V I is equal to 0 for all the interior points for the all the

31
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:04,700
interior points for the all the interior points for the all the interior points for the

32
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:11,100
so for the matrix we are looking at the integral of the derivative of the

33
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:16,760
product now the pro the integral of the product of the derivative of two basis

34
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:25,140
functions and because of the locality of the basis functions so both VI and VJ

35
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,400
are nonzero only zero so we can see that the derivative of the product of the

36
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:45,820
monetary duty SSD complete using no linear Fish I

37
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:50,840
this stoichiometric passion of this say pattern so now the D and the relative

38
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,940
molar of their premiums is equal to zero we show the hermit Europeans are general

39
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,220
Association and I D viewer k

40
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:02,820
or their support, the region in which they are non-zero, has no overlap,

41
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:08,780
then their product is going to stay zero over the entire domain.

42
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:22,320
Right, so remember we have, if this is x i, this is x j, we have many subintervals.

43
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:32,700
Because x i, if you think of the derivative of x i, phi x, so this is phi i, this is phi j,

44
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,040
they are both hat functions.

45
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:42,980
The derivative of phi i and phi j are like what?

46
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,200
The derivative of phi i is a constant positive value here and a constant negative here,

47
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,240
and zero.

48
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,040
Everywhere else.

49
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:58,360
And the derivative of phi j is positive here, negative here, and zero everywhere else.

50
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,660
So if you multiply the derivative of phi i with the derivative of phi j,

51
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:07,660
the product is zero in the entire domain,

52
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:12,960
because there is no interval in which both of the derivatives are non-zero.

53
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,720
So for most of pairs of i and j, aij is going to be zero.

54
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:28,200
aij is only non-zero when i and j are close enough.

55
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:36,520
How close do they need to be for this entry to be non-zero?

56
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,720
Well, of course, yeah.

57
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,860
They have to be immediate neighbors in this case, right?

58
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,080
So if they are immediate neighbors,

59
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,220
one of phi i is like that,

60
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,540
phi j is going to be like that.

61
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:01,260
So they have one element of overlap

62
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:06,360
in which the product of the derivatives are going to be non-zero.

63
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:11,220
Or if i is equal to j, right?

64
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,080
If i and j are equal,

65
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,640
then the derivative are the same,

66
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,320
and they are non-zero in two adjacent intervals.

67
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:33,340
So aij non-zero if i minus j absolute value less or equal to 1, right?

68
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:37,120
They are either immediate neighbors or they are the same.

69
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:47,440
So if a matrix is non-zero only for absolute value of i minus j less or equal to 1,

70
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,300
how does the sparsity pattern of the matrix look like?

71
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,780
It's going to be a tri-diagonal matrix, right?

72
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,680
Okay, so good.

73
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:07,900
Let's try to construct this tri-diagonal matrix for one-dimensional space.

74
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:14,700
All right.

75
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:14,740
All right.

76
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:28,740
, so here again, let's use the interval x to be a link space,

77
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,740
0, 1, and n.

78
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:37,740
Let's choose n to be just a 10 to start with, n equal to 10.

79
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,140
Okay, so we have,

80
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,940
we actually only have nine intervals in this case, right?

81
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:50,040
Because x goes from 0 to 1,

82
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,140
and there are nine intervals in this case.

83
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,740
So we have to put n in between.

84
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,740
So let's choose n equal to 9, right?

85
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,740
Okay.

86
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:03,740
So on that space, we have nine basis functions.

87
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,740
If we know the solution has zero boundary conditions.

88
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:09,740
If we know the solution has non-zero boundary conditions,

89
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,740
we need more basis functions.

90
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:14,740
Now we have nine basis functions.

91
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:20,740
We want to construct the matrix A, which is, let's set 0, 9.

92
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,240
In the beginning, right?

93
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,240
So we know most of the entries are 0, so we set it to be 0.

94
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,240
Let's first construct the diagonal entries.

95
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:38,240
So how big are the diagonal entries of this matrix,

96
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,240
which corresponds to i equals to j?

97
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,240
So the diagonal entries are entries corresponding to

98
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:55,240
aii is equal to integration from 0 to 1.

99
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:00,240
The derivative of phi i squared.

100
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:08,240
And we know it is non-zero only in two intervals.

101
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:14,240
Either the interval from xi minus 1 to xi,

102
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,240
and the interval xi to xi.

103
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,240
And the interval xi to xi.

104
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,240
And the interval xi to xi.

105
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,740
What's go on?

106
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,740
It's all linear.

107
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,740
So the all- punches.

108
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,740
Then i equals O are from 1 to 1.

109
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,740
So when we compute, y equals 1,

110
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,740
where's our investigations coming from?

111
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:28,740
Divided byuffy.

112
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,740
All our stuff is goes regular.

113
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,740
And we can choose what over Here we do an encryption theory.

114
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,740
Anamour has proved it is just an assumption for the

115
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,740
product end Execution we can do.

116
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,740
And if this is the value of method of one over x- of the

117
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,740
answer is f.

118
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,740
So far, very similar.

119
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,740
But we have to connect the type, the 얘.

120
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,740
And we want the definition.

121
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,740
And we want the definition for policy n 0.

122
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,740
Both, have all to be true.

123
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,740
Or we can write the!!!

124
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,740
For Я And this is .

125
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,740
And this- this is even better.

126
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,740
Thank you so much for your answers.

127
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:56,580
x i plus 1 minus x i right so in this case all our axes are the same but we're

128
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:03,220
going to evaluate to the X anyway so it's X 2 to n minus X 1 to n minus 1 and

129
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:12,720
now we have the squared values in both domains and we also want to multiply

130
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,300
this by the length of this integral so after multiplying by the interval

131
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:22,920
which is X i minus X i minus 1 the square is gone again and once we

132
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:28,880
multiply by this interval the minus 1 is gone and the square is gone so this

133
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:39,900
a ii is equal to X i minus X i minus 1 plus 1 over X i plus 1 minus X i right

134
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,660
so this is a ii

135
00:11:42,720 --> 00:12:00,180
so our DX right now is the length of the right so so this is a a ii is going to

136
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:11,760
be a summation between two adjacent intervals so I think let me see

137
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:21,800
right okay so I I made a mistake here when I'm constructing the matrix a so so

138
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:29,880
should the matrix a be a length be a 9 by 9 matrix or 8x8 matrix should be 8x8

139
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:42,360
matrix right because I only have oops I only have n minus 1 interior grid points

140
00:12:42,720 --> 00:13:04,520
Okay, so it's an 8x8 matrix, and so the diagonal entries of A are, I should be making, so diagonal is a function that constructs a diagonal matrix from a vector,

141
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:13,680
should be dx, so 1 over dx, 2 to n, plus 1 over dx, 1 to n minus 1.

142
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:26,260
So A has its diagonal entries assigned, right, so they are all 18.

143
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:30,200
Now let's figure out the off-diagonal entries of A.

144
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,420
Okay.

145
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,500
The off-diagonal entries of A.

146
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:43,820
The off-diagonal entries of A, A i, i plus 1, is going to be equal to an integration from 0 to 1,

147
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:56,080
the derivative of phi i times the derivative of phi j, which is i plus 1, partial x dx.

148
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:04,080
And this, because phi i is non-diagonal,

149
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:10,600
is non-zero at interval between x i minus 1 and x i plus 1.

150
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:16,320
And phi i plus 1 is non-zero in the interval between phi i and phi i plus 2.

151
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:23,060
So their product is only non-zero between x i and x i plus 1.

152
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:32,480
And their derivatives are what?

153
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:41,960
This derivative in between x i and x i, i minus 1, is something we derived before,

154
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:48,080
minus 1 over x i plus 1 minus x i.

155
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:53,420
Now this derivative is positive, because it's on the left of the basis.

156
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:59,480
But the value is the same, it's also 1 over the same interval length.
