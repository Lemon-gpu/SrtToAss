1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
So multiple dimensions is really a slight extension of the finite volume

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:11,880
scheme on a non-uniform grid. So in multiple dimensions, let's write our

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:20,920
conservation law as partial u partial t plus the divergence of a flux vector

4
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:30,680
which is a function of the solution u equal to 0. Okay and let's actually make

5
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:37,620
a little bit more general form.

6
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:45,480
Okay is equal to a function g, let's say, which can also be a function

7
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,920
few. So g is called the source term, that is the non-conventional

8
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:56,600
conservative part of the equation. So in momentum conservation, for example,

9
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:03,760
g can be a body force, gravity for example. In conservation of energy, g can

10
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:09,600
be a source of energy coming from something else. Let's say if you are

11
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,980
showing fluid dynamics equations, g can come from chemical reaction, right?

12
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,300
So g is a source term.

13
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,300
So u is a scale?

14
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:20,800
Huh?

15
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:20,900
u is a scale.

16
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:26,020
g is a scalar. Yeah, g is also a scalar. f is a vector corresponding to two or three

17
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,660
dimensions depending on how many spatial dimensions we have.

18
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:33,660
The gradient of f, the gradient of f.

19
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:41,220
So the gradient, no, this is the divergence. This is not the gradient. So f as a vector of u,

20
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:50,780
I can write it as fx of u, fy of u, fz of u. These are different components.

21
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:54,620
This is a differential equation. So f is a function of x, y, z components of the vector.

22
00:01:54,620 --> 00:02:04,360
And the divergence of this vector u is defined as the partial derivative of fx to x plus

23
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:14,620
partial derivative of fy to y plus partial derivative of fz to z.

24
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:20,660
If you apply the chain rule, because f is a function of u and u is a function of x, y and z.

25
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,900
If you apply the chain rule, you're going to get partial fx.

26
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:30,080
This is no longer partial because fx is a function of u.

27
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:49,360
In this case, dfx du times partial u partial x plus dfy du times partial u partial y plus dfz du partial u partial z.

28
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,660
Right?

29
00:02:50,660 --> 00:03:04,880
And this can be written as df vector du dot with the gradient of u,

30
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:19,340
where the gradient of u without the dot is defined as partial u partial x, partial u partial y and partial u partial z.

31
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,540
Right?

32
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:33,200
So depending on if you write the second term as the divergence of a flux or equal to a vector field, df du,

33
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,640
dot with the gradient of the solution.

34
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,760
This is two different differential forms of the same equation.

35
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,360
This is the conservative form.

36
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,960
This is what form?

37
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,580
The primitive form.

38
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,840
And that's the derivative form.

39
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,320
So, we can write the first step, the derivative form, or the derivative form of the equation.

40
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,320
Okay.

41
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:05,200
So the first step in deriving a final volume is to take the conservative form of the equation

42
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,340
and integrate to get the integral form.

43
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,500
Right.

44
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:18,560
So we take, this is the conservative form.

45
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,860
And this is the primitive.

46
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,540
Okay?

47
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:29,300
we take the conservative form of equation we integrate

48
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:45,500
integrate over space over a finite volume what we get is integration over a small volume let's say

49
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:59,120
over V partial u partial t plus divergence of f of u is going to be equal to integration over the

50
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:13,500
same V G of u DV let's say DV and the first term because V is a constant volume right in our setup

51
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,480
V is a constant volume if V is a constant volume then we integrate over space over a finite volume

52
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:22,980
actually changing as a function of time then there are more terms that is coming out but right

53
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:32,360
now let's say we have a fixed fixed volume we have a fixed mesh and each cell each final volume is a

54
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:44,080
stationary it's stationary in time what we get is DDT of the volume integrated you integrate over

55
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,460
the volume plus the volume over the volume and then we integrate over the volume and then we get

56
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:56,220
D and we apply the divergence theorem integral of the divergence of a vector is equal to integral

57
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:07,540
over the boundary right so the the the nabla operator is exchanged is replaced by the normal

58
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:15,280
the outward phase normal at the boundary dot with the same f of u DV becomes D s

59
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:20,360
and this is equal to integration of G dv.

60
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,120
Okay, and in final volume,

61
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,020
we track something that is closely related

62
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,780
to the cell integrals, which is the cell averages.

63
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:40,840
So we divide both sides by the volume of the cell,

64
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,140
by the volume of v.

65
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,680
Let's just call it v.

66
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:50,400
Right, so this is the volume of the cell.

67
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,960
And again, if v is stationary,

68
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,900
if the mesh is stationary as a function of time,

69
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,040
we can take the v into the time derivative.

70
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,320
So in the final volume,

71
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:08,360
so let's say if I have a cell and I discretize,

72
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:12,540
if I have a space where I want the solution,

73
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,380
if I divide the space into v,

74
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:21,660
v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v6, v7, et cetera,

75
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,320
then the d dt of ui,

76
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,400
where ui is defined as 1 over vi,

77
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,660
the cell size,

78
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:39,020
times the 1 over vi times the cell integral,

79
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,440
this plus 1 over vi,

80
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:43,520
right?

81
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:49,360
Integrated over the boundary of vi.

82
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:53,000
So for v1, the boundary is like this.

83
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,420
For v2, the boundary is like this.

84
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,660
For v3, the boundary is like this.

85
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:12,260
Okay? The surface normal dot with the flux vector ds is equal to gi,

86
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,780
which is the cell average of d.

87
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:14,840
Okay?

88
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,220
So this is the normal.

89
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:15,280
So this is the normal.

90
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:15,380
So this is the normal.

91
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:15,440
So this is the normal.

92
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,840
g computed on the ith volume.

93
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,120
So up to now this is still exact.

94
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,040
And now we start the approximation.

95
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,500
So this is still exact.

96
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,440
The approximation is the following.

97
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,100
We're going to approximate two things.

98
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,500
We're going to approximate, first of all,

99
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:53,440
this integral over the boundary of a cell, we're going to approximate the

100
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,680
boundary as a piecewise constant. We are going to approximate this f as a

101
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:07,300
piecewise constant function. So for example, let's take v2 as an

102
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:13,960
example. v2 has one part of boundary interfacing with v1. It has one part of

103
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:20,740
the boundary interfacing with v3, one part interfacing with v4, and one part

104
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:30,940
interfacing with v5. And we can split up this integral over the entire boundary

105
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:41,320
of vi into a summation of integrals. And the summation is over all the cells, all

106
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,920
the boundaries.

107
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:51,240
That over all the cells that are neighbor of that particular i. So I'm

108
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:58,720
going to write it as j inside the neighbor mbr of i. j is defined as a

109
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:06,940
neighbor of i if i and j shares a non-trivial interface. Right, so if the

110
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:13,840
flow can go from cell i to cell j through a boundary.

111
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:28,280
And this is the phase normal between i and j. So this is the average phase

112
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:38,960
normal between i and j. The dot with the flux between i and j and ds is going to

113
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,200
be s i and j.

114
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,840
Okay, this normal is the normal.

115
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:53,200
This normal is the average, the normal of the interface s is the total amount of interface

116
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,480
length.

117
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:03,060
In particular this approximation is approximating this f as piecewise constant.

118
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:12,280
Right so, and if we do that we can, we can say that the integration over partial, let

119
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,280
me,

120
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:26,120
over partial, over the boundary of i and j of n ds is going to be defined as n i j which

121
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:31,460
is a unit vector times s i j which is a scalar.

122
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:37,680
Okay so, so if we, if we say f of u is a constant over the interface we can pull that f out of

123
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,800
the integral and the integral is a purely geometric.

124
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,800
Okay.

125
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,680
So, weultan that f is just going to be plane on this surface, right.

126
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,720
So, we can wonder that what's going on over here when we put沒有 i z to where's this

127
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,040
particular, okay.

128
00:11:49,040 --> 00:12:01,120
Remember we can't do that, you can't

129
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,740
sticking your finger over the edge of this.

130
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,580
So, we have a point S

131
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,320
in the boundary, so creative delay, right?

132
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,360
Yes, and I want to figure out how to want to Personalize

133
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,120
this data so what we're going to do is several times within this darren, that's why the big

134
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,120
point.

135
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,120
Okay, let's do it very quickly.

136
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:24,580
is exactly orthogonal to the line connecting these two points. Okay.

137
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:34,740
Oh that's a very good point. I'm thinking in two dimensions. If you have

138
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:41,080
multiple dimensions, yes it's a plane, it's not just a line. So you will be

139
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:49,400
integrating the face normal over a potentially non-trivial surface and the

140
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:55,360
magnitude of that integral is going to be Sij, the direction of that integral is

141
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:04,240
going to be your Nij. One of the trivial cases is when, let me go to

142
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:10,260
the mesh then. So this plus this is equal to, if we also approximate Gi as

143
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:18,780
piecewise constant, then we are going to be applying G onto Ui. The function G

144
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:25,680
applied into Ui is going to be my right hand side. So here if I can approximate

145
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:38,820
the piecewise constant surface flux, if I can approximate Fij as a numerical flux,

146
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:45,760
this is theistol motion. What happens is our final result, second figure we

147
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,640
found, a tangential form. What happens is if you can dominated by Fij

148
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:58,380
by's vast enough tovous or am skull's mass of Ja, then My feelings that

149
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:05,920
we 행복 that is computed from Ui NJ then my finite volume scheme works.

150
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,960
Right question so far?

151
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:17,220
between any pairs of neighboring cells. And we are approximating the flux in

152
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:23,400
between these neighboring pair of cells using the cell averages on these two

153
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:34,680
cells. Yes? What do you mean by a non-trivial boundary? A non-trivial boundary is a boundary that has

154
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:43,700
length more than zero. It's not a point. Yes. So for example, if you have a

155
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:52,300
grid like that, these and these are neighbors, but these and these are not

156
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:55,280
called neighbors.
