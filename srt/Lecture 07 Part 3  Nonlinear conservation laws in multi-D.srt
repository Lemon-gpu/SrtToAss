1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The whole conservation law actually generalizes to multiple dimensions.

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:15,500
So let's start with the conservative form of conservation law in multiple dimensions.

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,420
We have partial u, partial t, plus, now we have multiple axes.

4
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,180
We have x and y and z, for example.

5
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:34,580
But no matter how big the dimension we have, we can write it as the divergence of a flux vector.

6
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:44,540
Where the flux now is not a scalar flux, as it should be, a vector in two or three dimensional space.

7
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:52,160
And it's the divergence of that vector that determines the time evolution of that solution u.

8
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,160
And of course...

9
00:00:54,180 --> 00:01:05,920
Of course the primitive form is taking chain rule on this second term.

10
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:18,700
And taking chain rule, we get df vector du, a scalar, dot with the gradient of u.

11
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,080
That is equal to zero.

12
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,080
And again...

13
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:29,680
This is a wave speed, except for now my wave speed is a vector.

14
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:38,360
It not only denotes how fast locally the wave at that also it determines towards which direction

15
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,700
does the wave

16
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,660
propagate.

17
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:46,940
Okay, and we also have the integral form.

18
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,440
The integral form again is

19
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,020
derived by integrating

20
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,180
over any domain, any continuous domain,

21
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,180
this differential equation.

22
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:14,980
So for example in 3D space, this is going to be dv, d volume, is equal to zero.

23
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,680
Okay, and

24
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:24,060
first of all, let's integrate the first term and move the differential to time out.

25
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,440
So, if we take the third term and move it to the third term, we have integral of dv, dv, dv, dv.

26
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:36,880
So again, if u is density in three dimension, this is the total mass encompassed in this volume omega.

27
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,980
The second term...

28
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,800
We can't use directly a fundamental theorem of calculus.

29
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,920
Yeah, Gauss's theorem.

30
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:54,060
So the integral of a volume of a divergence is equal to what?

31
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,180
Surface integral.

32
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:04,080
Is equal to a surface integral exactly over, let me denote partial omega as the surface encompassing the volume,

33
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,800
dot a normal vector ds,

34
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:13,420
where this is a surface integral over the surface, is equal to zero.

35
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,520
If you write it the other way, just to put a minus sign on the second term and move it towards the right hand side, it's

36
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,180
equal to zero.

37
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,180
So, we can see that...

38
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:31,180
And for example, I think it's easier to move the minus sign to here, so that we have a minus n.

39
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:40,180
So, n, the normal in Gauss's theorem is unit normal pointing outwards or inwards?

40
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,180
Outwards.

41
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,180
Outwards.

42
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:47,180
So, minus n is going to be a unit normal pointing inwards, right?

43
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:52,180
That means the rate of change of the total mass is going to be a unit normal pointing inwards.

44
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:52,680
Right?

45
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,180
Okay.

46
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:53,680
Okay.

47
00:03:53,680 --> 00:04:01,680
So, the total mass inside the volume is equal to the flux, is equal to the total flux into the volume.

48
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,680
Right?

49
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:12,680
Of course, the f can have the opposite sign, can point towards the different direction as minus n, the inside of the volume.

50
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,680
In that case, f represents a flux out of the volume.

51
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,680
If f is aligned, has a positive inner product with minus n,

52
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,680
f represents a flux into the volume.

53
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,680
All right.

54
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,680
So, this is how the conservation law works in multiple dimensions.

55
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,680
Any questions?

56
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:46,680
So, we will shelf this multi-dimension conservation law for later on when we discuss finite volume in multiple dimensions.

57
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,680
This lecture will focus on only the one-dimension scalar conservation law.

58
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,680
Okay.

59
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,680
So, the first thing we are going to do is to look at the scalar conservation law.

60
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:02,680
And the purpose of this is for us to have an intuitive understanding of how the solution in 1D looks like,

61
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,680
and for us to derive our finite volume scheme.

62
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,680
Okay.

63
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,680
Question?

64
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:17,680
Are the Fibonacci and the conservative equations saying something different physically, or is it just a matter of . . . ?

65
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,680
Right.
