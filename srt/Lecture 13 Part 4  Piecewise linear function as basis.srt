1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,540
So let's also, because you asked this question,

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:16,360
let's actually figure out what is the basis functions

3
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:25,360
for piecewise linear continuous space, right?

4
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,780
So let's figure out how can we choose these basis functions.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:42,700
So let's imagine we have a space of simply four intervals going from 0 to 1.

6
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,260
We have x1, x2, x3 here.

7
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,460
So let's say this is 0, this is 1.

8
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,980
And one of the simplicities of finite expression

9
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:00,000
is that it's not just a function of x1 and x2.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,400
The ultimate element comes from the fact that

11
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,760
we can choose basis functions that are local.

12
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:14,000
By local, I mean a function that is 0 in most part of the domain.

13
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:23,620
So for example, what kind of function can we choose

14
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:27,300
so that the first basis function,

15
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,880
let's just try to get the basis function,

16
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,980
can I choose a function that is 0 in most part of the domain?

17
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,220
So let's say we have a function that is only non-zero

18
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,740
within the first element, within the first interval.

19
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,920
How can we construct a function that is piecewise linear

20
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,660
and continuous and only non-zero in the first interval?

21
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:51,580
Just go from 1 back to 0 and stay 0 for the rest of the domain.

22
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,140
Exactly.

23
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,200
That's a very good idea of constructing a function

24
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,220
that is local, right?

25
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,420
So let's keep this as our first element.

26
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,180
Let's keep this as our first function in our basis.

27
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:02,820
Okay.

28
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,600
Can we construct a function that is only non-zero in the second element?

29
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,660
Most times.

30
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,740
Because it has to be continuous on both sides.

31
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:13,160
If a function is 0 at x1 and 0 at x2,

32
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,060
then it has to be 0 within the whole interval, right?

33
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,500
So we can't construct a function that is only non-zero in the second element.

34
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,920
But can we construct something that is different from the first one

35
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,340
but only non-zero in the first two elements?

36
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,660
How do we do that?

37
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,160
Huh?

38
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,660
What?

39
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,180
A head function, right.

40
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,380
So the head function, I think what you are referring to

41
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,260
is a function that starts over 0 here,

42
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:47,660
it gets to 1 at the grid point x1,

43
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,460
and go back to 0 at x2.

44
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:54,660
And then it also stays 0 for the rest of the domain, right?

45
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,660
Similarly, we can construct other heads, right?

46
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,100
Yes.

47
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:58,540
Okay.

48
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,040
Okay.

49
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,420
Okay.

50
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,540
So we have two head functions.

51
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:05,000
Function that stays 0 in the first element goes to 1 here,

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,180
goes back to 0 here.

53
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:13,960
Similarly, we can construct another head function that stays 0 here and do this.

54
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,580
And the boundaries are actually a special case

55
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:26,440
because it's a head function where the other half of the head is outside the domain, right?

56
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,580
So it's kind of a one-sided head function.

57
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,240
Now, in this case,

58
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:35,000
we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 basis functions.

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,360
So the question is,

60
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:45,660
can these five basis functions represent any continuous and piecewise linear function?

61
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:50,000
Where the pieces are these four elements over here?

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Or if I have an arbitrary function that is piecewise linear, okay,

63
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,080
can I represent this gray function?

64
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:04,840
Using a linear combination of these five basis functions we constructed.

65
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,220
And if so, how do we do that?

66
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,840
If no, can you construct a count example?

67
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,440
So this, I have a gray function f of x.

68
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:21,640
The question I was asking is, how do you represent f of f as a linear combination of

69
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:27,920
phi 1 of x, phi 2 of x, phi 3 of x, phi 4 of x, phi 5 of x, phi 6 of x, phi 7 of x, phi

70
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,700
1 of x, phi 8 of x.

71
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,700
How do you do that?

72
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:42,700
So the gray function would be what times phi 1 of x plus what times phi 2 of x.

73
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:51,980
So let's say if you know the exact form of f of x, how do you figure out the linear combination

74
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:52,980
coefficients?

75
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,840
So the basis function times phi 1 of f is f of x.

76
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,840
So the basis function times phi 1 of f is f of x.

77
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,680
So the basis function times phi 2 of x is f of x.

78
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,700
So the basis function times phi 2 of x is f of x.

79
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,700
So the basis function times phi 1 of f is f of x.

80
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,700
So if we do this, the nodes, that's the node ?

81
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,700
Yes.

82
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,420
The basis functions are one at each node, exactly.

83
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,760
So phi 1 is equal to one.

84
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,280
Well, let me name them differently.

85
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:19,640
Let me name them as phi 0, phi 1, phi 2, phi 3, and phi 4 so that the place they are equal

86
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,700
to one coincides with the numbering of the group points.

87
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,700
Right.

88
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:28,000
So if we do this, can you help figure out what are the linear combination coefficients?

89
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,560
Yeah.

90
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,860
f of 0, f of 1.

91
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:35,820
So this is the first linear combination coefficient is f of what?

92
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,000
0.

93
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,460
f of 0.

94
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:38,820
Okay.

95
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,820
The second one?

96
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,820
Oh, this is 0.

97
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,040
Yeah.

98
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:42,360
Okay.

99
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:46,780
Okay.

100
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,900
So this is the first one is f of 0.

101
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,400
And the second linear combination coefficient?

102
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:52,660
f of 1.

103
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,740
f of x1, right?

104
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,780
The value of x at x1.

105
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:10,180
So if you multiply f0 with phi 0 of x, because phi 0 at x equal to 0 is equal to 1.

106
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:23,380
If you multiply this, the Green function is going to be scaled to a value that is equal to f0 at x equal to 0.

107
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,220
So this is the Green function.

108
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,220
After this scaling.

109
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:35,540
And if you look at phi of 1, after the scaling by f of x1, remember this is f of x1.

110
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:42,460
After you scale phi 1 to f of x1, the red function is going to be like that.

111
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,280
Right?

112
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:53,840
That already allows us to reconstruct this gray line in the first element, in the first interval.

113
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:03,620
So this green line, the scaled green line plus the scaled red line is going to be equal to the gray line in the first interval.

114
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:16,880
And similarly, if we scale phi of 2 by f of x2, the black line after the scaling, because this is f of x2.

115
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:22,380
After the scaling, the function becomes this.

116
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,580
Okay.

117
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:25,920
So the scaling.

118
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:25,940
So the scaling.

119
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:25,980
So the scaling.

120
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:37,060
The scaled red line and the scaled black line, they combine together is going to reconstruct this function f in the second interval.

121
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:49,240
So the blue line after scaling by a negative number, f of x3, which is here, is going to become this.

122
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,420
Right?

123
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,700
So this negative hat is the scaled.

124
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:56,500
Scaled blue line.

125
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:04,800
And combined with the scaled black line, it is going to reconstruct this gray line in the third interval.

126
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:14,960
And lastly, once we scale phi 4 by f of x4, or f of 1, we are going to get the scaled green line.

127
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:20,720
Which combined with the blue line is going to give us f of x in the last interval.

128
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,420
Any questions so far?

129
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:22,580
Any questions so far?

130
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:22,660
Any questions so far?

131
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,020
In how do we represent a piecewise linear function?

132
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:29,480
Piecewise linear and continuous function using these hat functions.

133
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:47,120
So this is not just true for this particular division we into four intervals, but this can be done for any subdivision of any interval in one dimensions.

134
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:48,940
Right?

135
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:49,040
Right.

136
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,300
If you have any subdivision.

137
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:57,300
of any interval, you can construct the head function so that they are equal to 1 at one

138
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:02,100
grid point and equal to 0 at all other grid points.

139
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,700
And once you have the value of the function at the grid points, you can simply connect

140
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:11,460
the dots to form a head function.

141
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:18,120
Now you have all the head functions, you scale the head function by the value of any particular

142
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:24,880
known function at the corresponding grid points, you're going to get a collection of scaled

143
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,040
head functions.

144
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:33,880
Once you sum up the scaled head functions, you get the function you're trying to reconstruct.

145
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:41,520
So this is an example of how do you use a basis set to represent any function within

146
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,520
a linear space.
