1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,440
So today is lecture 2 and before we begin let me tell you something a little

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:20,400
bit more logistics. First of all let's open the Stellar website. So this is the

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,200
website I'll be posting all the materials and you're gonna see project

4
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:31,680
one is already posted and you should start working on it. I'll go over project

5
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:37,680
one pretty soon. There is also collaboration policy, general information

6
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:44,160
about the class and a tentative schedule right now posted on Stellar and you can

7
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:51,720
look at the schedule and plan ahead a little bit. Lecture one the MATLAB code

8
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,080
is posted as a zip file. The video recording is a link to

9
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:55,180
YouTube.

10
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:02,000
And there are two old slides I'm reading. So that's the old slides before I

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,860
changed the lecture style from basically given presentation on

12
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:13,640
the screen to actually writing down formulas on my tablet. The reason I

13
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:20,080
switched was because it is a lot easier to follow when I write

14
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,080
things down slowly on the screen. It's just like writing down on

15
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,680
the blackboard. Well if I just present you the formulas pre-written it's a lot

16
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:36,480
easier for me to go too fast. So that's why I switched to handwriting. But of

17
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:43,400
course my handwriting is far worse than the typed down latex. So that's why I

18
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:50,700
also posted the old slides for you to look at and study by yourself. And also

19
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,880
the reading is the same thing. It's basically the same as the old

20
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:02,140
slides but formatted differently, more like a PDF document. And also this, the

21
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:07,780
last PDF slide is actually my worst handwriting lecture notes that I

22
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:12,580
actually recorded during the lecture. So these are the stuff I will be posting

23
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:18,840
every lecture. And today the only thing different is I also posted a project

24
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,500
which let me open this up.

25
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,860
So the project is called the

26
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:24,880
Project of the Year. And it's a project that I'm going to be doing for the rest of my life. So the project is called the

27
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,020
Project of the Year. And it's a project that I'm going to be doing for the rest of my life. So the project is handed out today and it is due

28
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:34,380
September 26th. So it's exactly two weeks from now. So you get two weeks to

29
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:40,380
work on this project. As I said the project is very different from a typical

30
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:47,280
undergraduate assignment. In that like maybe the first question you see like a

31
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:54,860
series of questions. Like one, two, three and two bonus questions. So only the first one has

32
00:02:54,860 --> 00:03:00,580
a right answer. Only the first question is going to have a right answer. So the

33
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:08,680
this is basically modeling a bathtub with hot water in it. And the question is

34
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,400
how should the person be controlling the temperature in the bathtub while wasting

35
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:20,180
as little water as possible. And you'll be you'll be writing a code for solving

36
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:24,840
the PDE which is given here. It's a little bit more than

37
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,520
standard advection diffusion equation with the with the right hand side that

38
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:38,560
is H over D times T times Tc. And with also pretty standard boundary

39
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,320
conditions. We'll talk about boundary conditions later. So this one is a Robin

40
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:48,900
boundary condition and this the other end is a Newman boundary condition. So the

41
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:54,780
questions involves having you derive analytical solution to the PDE.

42
00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:01,500
Under special conditions. And the analytical solution is going to be used

43
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:08,940
when you write a code for solving the PDE numerically. Which is going to be

44
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:13,440
working not only for the special case of u equal to constant but for general

45
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:19,920
cases. That's the advantage of numerical method is it works for cases where

46
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:24,100
analytical solution doesn't exist or maybe it's too difficult.

47
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:30,780
But the reason we still want analytical solution is that we can compare our

48
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:36,560
numerical solution to the analytical solution for two reasons. One is to make

49
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,420
sure the code we write is actually working correctly. It's not giving

50
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:49,580
completely wrong answers. Two is it allows us to assess the accuracy of our solution.

51
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:54,620
So today we are actually going to be talking about how accurate our solution

52
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:54,740
is.

53
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:59,880
When we are using finite difference, finite volume, finite element. We are not

54
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:05,700
solving the equation exactly. We are approximating the equation. How much

55
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:14,520
approximation error is made? Is it case by case? The answer depends case by

56
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,420
case. So here you're going to use analytical solution to figure out how

57
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:22,680
accurate your solution is. And particularly you need to decide by

58
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,620
yourself. There is no right answer.

59
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:31,760
How fine your grid has to be in order to make the decisions you have to make in

60
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:38,720
question three. Which is extend your solver to general case and use your

61
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,440
solver to figure out a strategy. Also there is no right strategy but you

62
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:49,860
figure out a strategy that like you can make it as good as possible to have the

63
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,460
temperature as constant as possible while wasting as much energy. So you can

64
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,300
do as little water as possible.

65
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:03,320
Okay so these three questions if you do all these three perfectly you get full score but

66
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,880
I have two bonus questions. You can get more than full score so that like at the end of

67
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:18,160
the class if you happen to not get full score on some other projects these may be able to

68
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:24,300
make up a little bit. So the bonus questions are two parameters in the PDE is on

69
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:30,920
certain. How can you design an experiment to figure out what these

70
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:40,920
parameters really are and also quantify how your best strategy depends on various

71
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:47,640
parameters in the PDE. Alright you can see all these are very open-ended

72
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:52,480
questions. There is no single right answer. It's almost asking you to write a paper.

73
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:52,980
Right.

74
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:59,640
So this is the type of projects we are going to be doing throughout the

75
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,540
semester and any questions about this particular one?

76
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:08,680
Yes?

77
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:18,680
How should we provide the answer? Can we provide the answer if we have to do calculations in handwriting or if everything has to be done on the computer?

78
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,540
That's a good question. So the question is are you supposed to

79
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,040
write a paper?

80
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,540
Yes.

81
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:29,540
Can you write down your solution in handwriting or it has to be typed on the computer?

82
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:36,540
So the answer to the question is either way is fine. But the submission is going to be in electronic form.

83
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:44,540
Which means if you choose to handwrite your solution you need to find a scanner and scan them and upload your PDF file.

84
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:50,540
Or you can just use your cell phone. There are pretty good apps to use a cell phone for scanners.

85
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,040
Alright so the end of the session.

86
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,540
Thank you.

87
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:58,540
At the end of this project you'll be submitting two things.

88
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:09,040
One is a PDF file that contains basically the entire report and don't include any of your, don't include like your code in the PDF file.

89
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,540
We won't be looking at them.

90
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:17,040
The PDF file is intended to serve pretty much like an academic paper.

91
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,540
And the other is a zip file containing all your code.

92
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,540
And make sure it has all the files that like if somebody wants to use it.

93
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,040
Okay.

94
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:31,540
So that like if somebody, if our TA looks at your report and see something.

95
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,540
We won't be running everybody's code.

96
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:38,040
But if we see your report and something makes us want to run your code.

97
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:41,540
Make sure we can run your code.

98
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:44,040
Alright.

99
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,540
Any other questions?

100
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,040
Yes?

101
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,040
Does Python code have to do with?

102
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,040
That's a very good question.

103
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,040
I'll answer this question.

104
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:57,040
Right after I finish discussing this particular project.

105
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,040
Which language we should use.

106
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,040
Any other questions about this particular project?

107
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,040
Yes?

108
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:10,040
Do we need to upload a separate code for each question or just one?

109
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,040
Or a big file?

110
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,040
You need to, that's a very good question.

111
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,040
So we ask you to upload a single zip file.

112
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,040
So they should contain all the code.

113
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:28,040
And I would suggest making a separate directory for each individual question.

114
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:33,040
That will make it a lot easier for us to look at your code.
