1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
Alright, last lecture we discussed how to estimate the error in finite element solutions.

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:14,000
How much error it was caused by limiting the space of solution from the infinite dimensional space

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,880
in the weak form of the differential equation to a finite dimensional space,

4
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:22,920
which we can represent as a linear combination of a few basis functions

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,300
and derive a set of algebraic equations for the linear combination coefficients.

6
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:34,580
So the error estimate we have looked at are mostly a priori error estimates

7
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:43,620
because the precise form of the error is going to depend on the particular solution,

8
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,960
not the approximate solution.

9
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:51,460
So finally, in the last lecture, we derived several facts.

10
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:56,660
One is that in the energy norm, the finite element solution was the optimal

11
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,240
in how much error it has.

12
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:08,760
And in both H1 and L2 norm, the finite element solution is optimal up to a certain factor,

13
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:12,880
up to a certain finite factor that doesn't depend on the grid size.

14
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,800
That enables us to bound the finite element solution error

15
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:24,840
by one particular type of approximation, which is piecewise linear interpolant.

16
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:34,720
And the precise error of the piecewise linear interpolant actually then depends on the curvature,

17
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:40,900
which is the second order derivative of the actual solution, not the finite element solution.

18
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,340
Therefore, that is a priori error estimate.

19
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,420
The form of the error depends on the actual solution.

20
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,540
And this lecture, we will talk about a posteriori error estimate,

21
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:59,800
which we are going to derive a form of an error estimate

22
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:05,940
that actually depends on not the real continuous solution, but the discrete solution.

23
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,000
That is some error estimate we can actually compute.

24
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:10,400
Right?

25
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,740
So in order to introduce that kind of a posteriori error estimate,

26
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:22,500
the posteriori estimate cannot be actually applied to the entire solution.

27
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,820
It can only be applied to the entire solution.

28
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:24,840
Right?

29
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:24,900
Right?

30
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:24,920
Right?

31
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:24,980
Right?

32
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:25,000
Right?

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,020
Right?

34
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:25,040
Right?

35
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,300
Right?

36
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:25,340
Right?

37
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:25,900
Right?

38
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,320
By instance, we first need a form of a posteriori error.

39
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:27,400
Right?

40
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,040
By instance, we first need a form of an error estimate.

41
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,320
Right?

42
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:30,440
Right?

43
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:30,460
Right?

44
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,120
So, for instance, we used this producer.

45
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,600
Right?

46
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:31,660
Right?

47
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:31,960
Right.

48
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,000
Right?

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,060
Right.

50
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:46,740
There is a

51
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:47,340
right?

52
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,000
Right?

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,240
where we get our final admin solution.

54
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,420
What we're interested in is not usually the entire solution.

55
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:10,120
We are interested in a particular final number of quantities

56
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,080
computed from the solution.

57
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:18,620
And here I'm going to write this as L0 of U.

58
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,260
What are some examples of this L of U?

59
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:29,360
In aerodynamics problems, this may be the lift or drag of an airplane.

60
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:35,860
In heat transfer problems, if I'm interested in solving for a temperature field

61
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:40,640
that concerns the damage due to heat to some material,

62
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:46,380
I may be interested in the maximum temperature in a certain material.

63
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,200
So these are quantities I'm interested in.

64
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,200
This is the quantities that...

65
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,820
tells me why am I solving this PDE.

66
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:01,060
Okay, so that is L0 of U that, let's say, for example,

67
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,380
give me just one single number.

68
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,160
L0 itself is a linear function.

69
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,720
So it is a linear...

70
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,180
functional...

71
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,780
of the solution.

72
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:20,780
Alright.

73
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,160
So the error estimate...

74
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:35,260
should approximate the difference between L0 operated on the finite element solution

75
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:40,100
minus the same functional operated on the real solution.

76
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,420
So here I'm trying to estimate

77
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:47,940
if I spent a million times more computation effort

78
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,780
getting a much better approximation,

79
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,240
how much difference does that make to my...

80
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,260
quantity of interest?

81
00:04:55,260 --> 00:05:03,680
If the difference is minor, is more compared to, let's say, other uncertainties from the setup of the problem,

82
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,680
let's say the material properties, etc.,

83
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,200
then I shouldn't spend this additional effort solving the PDE to much more accuracy.

84
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,200
But if the error turns out to be large,

85
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:19,200
and it's large compared to other sources of uncertainty,

86
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,840
and I have the computational resources, then I should spend...

87
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:28,260
the computational time refining the grid and getting a more accurate solution.

88
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,260
Right.

89
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:33,260
So this is what we are trying to approximate.

90
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:38,260
And the linearity of the output functional allows me to...

91
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:42,260
say this is actually equal to L0 operated on...

92
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,260
U-H minus U.

93
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,260
Right.

94
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,260
So that's simply linearity.

95
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,260
So how do I estimate that quantity?

96
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,260
To estimate...

97
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:58,260
that quantity, I'm going to introduce another equation.

98
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:01,260
I'm going to introduce what's called the adjoint equation.

99
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,260
Remember, what are the place...

100
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:14,260
what is the place that a linear functional appeared before?

101
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:17,260
It's the right-hand side of a weak form.

102
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,260
Right.

103
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:23,260
So the trick in this a posteriori area estimate...

104
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:28,260
is to introduce or invent another weak form...

105
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:33,260
that uses this L0, which is a different linear functional...

106
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,260
from the L in the differential equation.

107
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:40,260
So I'm going to introduce another equation that uses this L0...

108
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,260
as the right-hand side of the weak form.

109
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:46,260
Particularly, I'm going to introduce an adjoint equation that is A star,

110
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,260
which is different from this A also.

111
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:51,260
I'm going to tell you what A star has to be a little bit later.

112
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:56,260
So let me call this U hat being the solution of this different differential equation.

113
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:01,260
And V has to equal to L0 of V.

114
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:11,260
For all possible Vs, remember this L0 has to be operated on the difference between UH and U.

115
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:17,260
So this V in this differential equation should belong to the space of XU.

116
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,260
Right.

117
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,260
That's the space where U has to belong to.

118
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:28,260
So the test space of this adjoint equation is the primal space,

119
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,260
is the space of, is the solution space,

120
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:37,260
the also called trial space of the original differential equation.

121
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,260
Okay.

122
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:48,260
And it turns out that my U hat, the solution...

123
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,260
whose solution U hat should be in...

124
00:07:51,260 --> 00:08:00,260
the XV should be in the space of the test functions in the original differential equation.

125
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,260
Okay.

126
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,260
So how is this going to be helpful?

127
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:12,260
Let's try to use the manually constructed differential equation

128
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:15,260
to figure out how do I further derive this.

129
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:18,260
So if I have this, then my...

130
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:24,260
I know that for all V in this XU, this weak form is equal.

131
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:31,260
So that allows me to substitute this particular UH minus U into V.

132
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:38,260
This is going to give me A star of U hat and UH minus U.

133
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,260
Right.

134
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,260
Okay.

135
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:46,260
Now here comes to what this A star has to be.

136
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:52,260
So the reason it's called the adjoint equation is that A star and the A in the original equation,

137
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,260
they are adjoint operators.

138
00:08:55,260 --> 00:09:03,260
So A star and A are so-called adjoint.

139
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:14,260
In that the definition of adjoint is that A of U, V is exactly equal to A star of V and U.

140
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,260
For...

141
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:21,260
All pairs of U and V.

142
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,260
So this is U, this is V.

143
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:29,260
If these As are matrices, what does adjoint mean?

144
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,260
They're just transpose.

145
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,260
Exactly.

146
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,260
Exactly.

147
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:38,260
So A star in finite dimensional sense would be just transpose of A.

148
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,260
Okay.

149
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:44,260
So now we know that A star of U hat and UH minus U

150
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,260
is equal to...

151
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:56,260
A of UH minus U and U hat.

152
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:59,260
Right.

153
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:04,260
So here we use the original differential equation.

154
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:14,260
Before that we are going to expand it using the bilinearity of A.

155
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:22,260
So first of all, U hat is a member of XV.

156
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:29,260
So by the original differential equation, by this original differential equation, if V...

157
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:39,260
If I substitute V by U hat, what I get is this is equal to L of what?

158
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,260
U hat.

159
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,260
Right?

160
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,260
Okay.

161
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:55,260
So therefore, this whole thing is equal to A of UH, U hat minus L of U hat.

162
00:10:55,260 --> 00:11:01,260
Or, so let's look at what is the consequence of this equality we derived.

163
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:10,260
The error in the output linear functional, okay, is equal to the left-hand side minus

164
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,260
right-hand side.

165
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:15,260
If you look at the original equation, okay, this is the original equation.

166
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:19,260
Left-hand side is A of UV, right-hand side is L of V.

167
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:24,260
Here, this is A of UH and U hat.

168
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,260
This is the right-hand side L of U hat.

169
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:34,260
So this is the residual of the original differential equation.

170
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:40,260
When I substitute the solution U by the finite dimension or finite elements,

171
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:50,260
solution UH, and I substitute the V, the test function, by this solution of the adjoint

172
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:53,260
equation, U hat.

173
00:11:53,260 --> 00:12:03,260
So, remember, this is just the A of UV minus L of V.

174
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,260
So this is A of UH of this.

175
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:09,260
For V is particularly equal to L of V.

176
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:17,260
And this is particularly equal to U hat.

177
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,260
So why is this a posteriori error estimate?

178
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:24,260
Because this formula involves UH, not U.

179
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,260
Right?

180
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,260
And this formula is up to now exact.

181
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:31,260
We make no approximation whatsoever.

182
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:37,260
The only approximation we are going to make is to V, because here, V is still the exact

183
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,260
solution.

184
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:42,260
The exact solution of the adjoint equation.

185
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,260
Right?

186
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:51,260
So, we are going to solve V using numerical method and substitute that V into this error

187
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,260
formula.

188
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,260
And we get an error estimate.

189
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:58,260
I mean, it's an estimate because I'm solving a numerical approximation for V, not the exact

190
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,260
V.

191
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:04,720
If I have the exact V in some way, then I have an exact formula for the error.
