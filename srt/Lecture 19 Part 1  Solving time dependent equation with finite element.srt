1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,760
The final thing we want to discuss for finite element is how to solve time-dependent equations using finite elements.

2
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:14,320
We have previously focused on mostly steady-state equations, including Poisson's equation.

3
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:23,840
The second derivative is equal to a known function, and we also touched the beam equation, which is again a steady-state equation.

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:33,800
The question today is how do we discretize the time derivative using finite volume, or how do we deal with the time derivative?

5
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:42,960
How do we transform the PD with DDT unit into an OD as we did before?

6
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:53,820
We are going to use again a very simple example, just adding a time derivative term onto the right-hand side of a Poisson's equation.

7
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,960
So Poisson's equation would be the second derivative equal to a given function f.

8
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,280
Today we are going to look at a heat equation instead.

9
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,700
Okay, so we remember infinite element.

10
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,460
How do we start in discretizing an equation?

11
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:17,540
We started by multiplying this equation with a test function, right?

12
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:23,540
With an arbitrary test function within a certain space, and thereby derive the weak form.

13
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,200
All finite element discretization started with a weak form.

14
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:40,840
So if we multiply this equation with a V, so let's say, let's use the bracket as inner product in the L2 sense.

15
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:49,400
So the bracket is going to be integration over the entire space, V times the ODT over the x.

16
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,320
Would be equal to V.

17
00:01:53,840 --> 00:02:03,160
So we have a second derivative for all V within a certain space that we don't know yet.

18
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,160
So let's decide about it later.

19
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:10,160
Okay, so let's now write down what this inner product is.

20
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:20,160
So first of all, we have V times the ODT over, let's say, a one-dimensional space from A to B.

21
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,160
Would be equal to the integral from A to B.

22
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,840
V times the second derivative of U.

23
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:36,840
And if we want to use the same technique we used to deal with Poisson's equation, on the right-hand side of this equation, what should we do?

24
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,840
Integrate by parts, right.

25
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,840
So here we need some boundary conditions.

26
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:46,840
Let's assume we have a simple boundary condition, U A equal to U B equal to zero.

27
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,840
Then through integration by parts,

28
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,840
we know that this V, or the integral from A to B, is equal to 0.

29
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,840
So we have a simple boundary condition, U A equal to U B equal to 0.

30
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,840
And we also have to satisfy the same boundary condition.

31
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:02,840
So with integration by parts, the boundary terms get removed through the boundary condition.

32
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,840
And we also are removing the second-order derivative.

33
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:14,840
And both U and V have a first-order derivative in this bilinear form.

34
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,840
Right?

35
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,840
Okay.

36
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,840
And we also look at the left-hand side.

37
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:29,840
And realize that we are integrating only in space, not in time.

38
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,840
So the time derivative can be removed, can be pulled out of the integral.

39
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:45,840
So the left-hand side becomes d dt of a integral U V dx,

40
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,840
would be equal to minus integration of derivative of V,

41
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:58,840
derivative of U dx.

42
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,840
Now we get two bilinear forms.

43
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,840
One is integration of U V.

44
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,840
The other integration of du dx times dv dx.

45
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,840
Right? Both are bilinear forms.

46
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:18,840
Except for one bilinear form has a time derivative in it.

47
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,840
Okay.

48
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:26,840
To discretize this equation, we apply the same type of finite element discretization

49
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,840
on both bilinear forms at the same time.

50
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,840
What is that discretization?

51
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:41,840
The discretization is restricting ourselves from an infinite dimensional space

52
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,840
to a finite dimensional subspace.

53
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,840
Okay.

54
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,840
So for discretization,

55
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,840
so up to here, everything is analytical.

56
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,840
So now let's switch to a discretized form.

57
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:10,840
So now, restrict U to be a summation of I goes from 1 to n of U I,

58
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,840
which is now a number instead of a function,

59
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,840
times phi I,

60
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,840
which are the basis functions of the finite dimensional space.

61
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,840
So now we have the finite dimensional subspace.

62
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:25,840
Here, we can use the piecewise linear and continuous space

63
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,840
as we did before in Poisson's equation.

64
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,840
Right?

65
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,840
Okay.

66
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,840
Where the phi's, if we draw them,

67
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,840
phi 1 is going to be like that,

68
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,840
phi 2 is going to be like that in 1D,

69
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,840
phi 3 is going to be like that.

70
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,840
So these are the piecewise,

71
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,840
these are the basis functions of the piecewise continuous and continuous space.

72
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,840
And these are the continuous and piecewise linear functions.

73
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,840
Well, the continuous and piecewise linear functions.

74
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,840
Okay.

75
00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:02,840
Now we also substitute phi j to our test function v,

76
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,840
because if this is satisfied for v equal to any of the phi j's,

77
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,840
this can be satisfied by the principle of linear superposition

78
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,840
for all the v's.

79
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,840
That can be expressed as linear combination of phi j's.

80
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:26,840
So what we have is d dt of integral a to b.

81
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,840
u is now a linear combination.

82
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,840
v is now phi j, phi x,

83
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,840
is equal to minus of now the derivative of v,

84
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,840
which is phi j,

85
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,840
and the derivative of u,

86
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,840
which is a summation.

87
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,840
So we have the integral of ui,

88
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,840
the derivative of phi i.

89
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:01,840
The right hand side is exactly the same as we dealt with in Poisson's equation.

90
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,840
We pull the summation and the ui out of the integral,

91
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,840
thereby getting summation of i goes from 1 to n,

92
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:16,840
ui times the integral of derivative of phi j,

93
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,840
times the derivative of phi i.

94
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,840
This is exactly the matrix we call A.

95
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:30,840
And this is the j-th entry of the matrix A

96
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:35,840
we used before to discretize the Poisson's equation.

97
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,840
Right?

98
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,840
Okay.

99
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,840
And the left hand side is a little bit different.

100
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,840
The left hand side, we still pull all of these out.

101
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,840
But the left hand side, we still pull all of these out.

102
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,840
But remember these ui's,

103
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,840
they are individual numbers at every t.

104
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:59,840
But these ui's are what makes the solution u time dependent.

105
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,840
So ui's are actually functions of t,

106
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,840
while the phi j and phi i,

107
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,840
they are not functions of t.

108
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,840
Therefore, we can pull the summation of ui

109
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,840
out of the integral.

110
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,840
But we cannot pull it out of the time derivative.

111
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,840
What we can pull out of the time derivative

112
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,840
is the remaining integral in space.

113
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,840
So let's write it down.

114
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,840
d dt of...

115
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,840
And the summation can be pulled out.

116
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,840
Right?

117
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,840
Summation can be pulled out,

118
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,840
but like,

119
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,840
d ui dt has to be put onto the time derivative.

120
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,840
And then we have integration of

121
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,840
phi i,

122
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,840
phi j,

123
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,840
d x.

124
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,840
And these are not in the time derivative

125
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,840
because they are not functions of time.

126
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,840
Now,

127
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,840
this is another,

128
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,840
this is the discretization of a different bilinear form.

129
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:11,840
This bilinear form also is discretized into a matrix.

130
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,840
And let's call it mj.

131
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:19,840
Equating the left hand side to the right hand side,

132
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,840
what we get is m,

133
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,840
the matrix m,

134
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,840
okay?

135
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,840
Think of mj,

136
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,840
I multiply it by d ui dt.

137
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,840
This is m times d u dt,

138
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:36,840
where u is now the vector of u1, u2, u3, etc.

139
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,840
So this is a vector times a matrix,

140
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,840
being the left hand side.

141
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,840
And the right hand side is equal to

142
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,840
minus a matrix times the vector u.

143
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,840
Interestingly, we get,

144
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,840
when we discretize this equation,

145
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:59,840
we don't get a d vector u dt equal to a matrix times u.

146
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,840
We get another matrix,

147
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,840
we call the math matrix.

148
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,840
You find the element.

149
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,840
Times the time derivative of u equal to,

150
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,840
now this is something we call the stiffness matrix,

151
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,840
minus a.

152
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,840
Times the vector u.

153
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,840
So in finite element jargon,

154
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,840
this is math matrix.

155
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,840
This is stiffness.

156
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,840
The reason for that is,

157
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:31,840
in the days even without computers,

158
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,840
people are trying to simulate complex structures.

159
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,840
Not by using computer simulation,

160
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,840
but by connecting a bunch of math

161
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,840
with,

162
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,840
with springs.

163
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,840
Okay, to study the vibration of buildings,

164
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,840
bridges, for example.

165
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,840
And that is when,

166
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,840
when you have some mass,

167
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,840
represented by a math matrix,

168
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,840
and the stiffness of the springs,

169
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,840
represented by the stiffness matrix.

170
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,840
And people used to solve these equations by hand,

171
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,840
until about the 1940s,

172
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,840
when finally there are electronic computers,

173
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:15,840
when people start to solve these equations using computers.

174
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,840
And they are now able to solve huge equations,

175
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,840
coming from structures.

176
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,840
But they still use the words,

177
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,840
math matrix and stiffness matrix,

178
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,840
to represent the discretization

179
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,840
of what is multiplied on the time derivative term,

180
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,840
and what is multiplied,

181
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,840
to get the,

182
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,840
multiplied on the,

183
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,840
on the state.

184
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,840
And what you can imagine is that,

185
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,840
if you have a wave equation,

186
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,840
so instead of a first order derivative on t,

187
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,840
you have a second order derivative on t.

188
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,840
Right, so then instead of heat equation,

189
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,840
you get wave equation.

190
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,840
Everything follows exactly the same way.

191
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,840
This is because it doesn't matter in the,

192
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,840
in what we pull out and pull in,

193
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,840
the derivatives and integrals.

194
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,840
It doesn't matter if the time derivative is first order or second order.

195
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,840
If it's a wave equation,

196
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,840
we have exactly the same math matrix,

197
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,840
exactly the same stiffness matrix.

198
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,840
Except for the dU dt becomes d square U,

199
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,840
dt square.

200
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,840
Right.

201
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,840
Then we can use,

202
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,840
just a different method of time integration for the ODE,

203
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,840
to solve the wave equation.
