1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Now we have the discrete Fourier series. How do we apply von Neumann stability analysis?

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Let's plug this series into the differential equation and see what happens.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So again, the exponential term has nothing to do with time derivative.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The only term that has to do with time derivative is the u hat k term.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So we have a d u hat k dt times e to the jk i delta x.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So that's the left-hand side. And the right-hand side is different from the continuous case.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
What's amazing, at least to me, is that

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
when we plug this in,

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
we plug the Fourier series into the continuous derivative,

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
we get rid of the coupling between different exponentials.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
That actually also happens for discrete differential operators on a uniform grid.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So we look at the right-hand side. We have a kappa of something long divided by delta x squared.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And let's take a look at what this something long is.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So first of all, all the terms u of i plus 1,

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
u of i plus 1,

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
u of i minus 1,

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
and u of i,

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:35,000
they are summation of k over the same space.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And all of them are u hat of k.

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
That we don't have anything to do.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I mean, they are different only with i.

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So the parenthesis is the following.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
e to the jk i plus 1 delta x, right?

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So that's the u i plus 1 term.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Plus e to the jk of i minus 1 delta x.

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
That's the u i minus 1 term.

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Minus e to the jk i delta x.

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So that's the effect of plugging in the discrete Fourier series

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
into the discretized differential equation. Yeah?

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Ah, we need the two. Thank you.

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So we have the discrete operator.

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And now the key question is,

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
what is this thing in the parenthesis?

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Right?

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So let's, on the next page,

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
figure out what is this thing on the parenthesis.

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Can I just...

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I can still write here, but, uh, anyway.

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So the parenthesis is j to the j plus...

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Not j plus 1.

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Ah...

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
jk i plus 1.

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
jk i plus 1 delta x.

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Plus e to the jk i minus 1 delta x.

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Minus 2 e jk i delta x.

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So, the first thing to do is to expand this

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
as e to the jk i delta x

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
plus jk delta x.

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And this to e to the jk i delta x

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
minus jk delta x.

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Right?

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And then, the summation...

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
the exponential of summations

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
is equal to the product of exponentials.

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And same thing as here,

56
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
except for there is a minus sign.

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And now we can collect the terms.

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
We all have this term, this term, and this term.

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It becomes e to the jk i delta x

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
times e to the jk delta x

61
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
plus e to the minus jk delta x

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
minus 2.

63
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
All right?

64
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So now, this is something that does not depend on i.

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It only depends on k.

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So now we plug this back into the equation we started.

67
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
We have summation of k.

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Ah...

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
du hat k.

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Ah...

71
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,000
dt e to the jk i delta x

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
is going to be equal to the same summation

73
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
u hat of k.

74
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Ah...

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Okay, I missed a kappa here.

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
There is a kappa here.

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Ah... u hat of k.

78
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
This thing divided by delta x squared.

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So we have e to the jk i delta x.

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Okay, so let me first write...

81
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So what we are going to be doing is plug what we derived earlier into the equation.

82
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:15,000
All right, so this is...

83
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
This is the equation we finally got.

84
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
After manipulating the discrete Fourier series.

85
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Again, we can match terms.

86
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
On the left-hand side, we have this.

87
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
On the right-hand side, we have kappa times u hat of k

88
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
times this thing we just derived.

89
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
All right?

90
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
What is left is basically summation of the same co...

91
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
the coefficient times e to the jk i delta x.

92
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's the same here. It's the same here.

93
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So that means

94
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
du hat of k dt

95
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
would be equal to kappa times u hat of k

96
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
times...

97
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Let me just write u hat of k later.

98
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Times this weird long thing we just derived.

99
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Times u hat of k.

100
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
But no matter how weird this thing is,

101
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
it is the time derivative of u hat of k

102
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:29,000
equal to something times u hat of k.

103
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:36,000
That's a differential equation we know the analytical solution of.

104
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Right?

105
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So it's just u hat of k equal to exponential of this whole thing times t.

106
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And what determines the stability of this equation?

107
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Yes, the real part of this whole thing has to be negative.

108
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
This number, it can be a complex number.

109
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
In this case, it happens to be a real number.

110
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
But if it's a complex number,

111
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
we only need to make sure the real part of this

112
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
or the number is on the left-hand side of the complex plane.

113
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Compare this to the analytical.

114
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So this is the discrete.

115
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
And compare to the analytical case.

116
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Let's use blue.

117
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
We have du hat of k dt equal to,

118
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
in this case, analytically,

119
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
we had kappa minus k squared.

120
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Right?

121
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Kappa minus k squared.

122
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
u hat of k.

123
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
The continuous and discrete case,

124
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
they look slightly different.

125
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And this is the effect of discretization.

126
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
All right.

127
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And let's figure out what this is.

128
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So,

129
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
so e to the jk delta x

130
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
is equal to cosine of j,

131
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
no j,

132
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
cosine of k delta x

133
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
plus i sine of k delta x.

134
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
e to the minus jk delta x

135
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
is equal to the same cosine,

136
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
but minus i times sine of k delta x.

137
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And therefore, the summation of them

138
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
turns out to be positive.

139
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And if I minus another 2,

140
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
this 3, which is here,

141
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
would be equal to

142
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
2 times cosine k delta x

143
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
minus 2.

144
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Right?

145
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So that's what we get.

146
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Okay.

147
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And if you look at the cosine function,

148
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
and remember, we're also dividing this by delta x squared.

149
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And if you look at the cosine function,

150
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
and if you remember the Taylor series expansion

151
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
of this cosine function at 0,

152
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
the first derivative is 0.

153
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
The second derivative is minus half.

154
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So, when k times delta x is small,

155
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
when delta x is small enough compared to k,

156
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
what you get is,

157
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
this is actually a good approximation of minus k squared.

158
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
So,

159
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
so 2 times cosine k delta x

160
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
minus 2 over delta x squared

161
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
approximates minus k,

162
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
right,

163
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
minus k squared,

164
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,000
when delta x times k is small.

165
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Alright.

166
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And also, another good thing is that,

167
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
what is the sign of this number?

168
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Positive or negative?

169
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's always negative, right?

170
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
That's another good thing.

171
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
That means this differential equation,

172
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
if the time derivative is solved exactly,

173
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
it is going to be always stable.

174
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
That's a hallmark of a good discretization,

175
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
is something always stable is great.
