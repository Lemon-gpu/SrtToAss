1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Okay, let's go to system of conservation laws.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Find a volume and actually also find a difference are not very difficult with not just one conservation law but a system of conservation laws.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:26,000
A system of conservation law is going to be multiple quantities coupled with each other.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:43,000
In a conservation law sense, that means the flux of one quantity is determined not just as a function of that quantity itself but as a multivariate function of several quantities.

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The simplest type of conservation law is coupling two quantities.

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So the time derivative of...

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Let me...

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Let me illustrate it in a scalar sense.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The time derivative of u1 plus a flux, I call it 1, of u1 and u2 dx is equal to 0.

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Also, the time derivative of u2 is a function also of u1 and u2.

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
If f1 and f2 are both 0,

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
f1 and f2 are both 0,

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:34,000
if f1 and f2 are both linear, then this is not very different from the second project we just submitted last week.

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
But in this case, f1 and f2 can be nonlinear functions.

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So I'm just going to give very...

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm just going to give one example that is exactly like that.

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's called the shallow water equation.

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's called the shallow water equation.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's called the shallow water equation.

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's called the shallow water equation.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's called the shallow water equation.

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's called the shallow water equation.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Shallow water equation is the equation that models the movement of water, of any fluid,

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
under the influence of gravity, a shallow layer of water.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It actually describes, for example, the waves on a beach pretty well before it breaks.

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
So...

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And you can do a lot of interesting experiments with it.

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And the reason actually...

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
If you look at the movement of waves over a beach,

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
and the reason the wave breaks is...

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,000
In this shallow water equation, it's going to appear as a shock wave in the shallow water equation.

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You're going to create a discontinuity in the height of the water,

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
which in real case, it'll just fall down and break as a wave.

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So in the shallow water equation, it's going to be like this.

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So in the shallow water equation, the two quantities we are modeling

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
are first of all the height of the water.

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So you have, let's say, a water column like that.

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So the height of the water, and also the velocity of the water.

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Right, how fast the water is moving, either towards the left or towards the right.

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And in reality,

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:29,000
the reason that h is a conservative quantity is because we are modeling water as incompressible.

42
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So h integrated over x is what?

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So if you integrate h over x,

44
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
it's the volume, it's how much water you have.

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And velocity doesn't really integrate to be a conservative quantity.

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So instead, we use u times h as a conservative variable.

47
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:06,000
If you multiply u over h and integrate over dx, what do you get?

48
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Also, we need to assume the density is a constant, which is the case.

49
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So if you multiply rho times u times h over dx, what do you get?

50
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The momentum.

51
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The momentum, exactly.

52
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So these are the two conservative quantities in this equation.

53
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And we can see how the flux of each quantity is going to be a function of the other quantity.

54
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
For example,

55
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
in order to derive this equation, it's actually a lot easier to derive it from the integral form.

56
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So d dt, for example,

57
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
of the integral over h,

58
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:58,000
which is the total amount of water in between a and b,

59
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,000
is equal to the flux into the volume minus the flux out of the volume.

60
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:16,000
What is the flux of water into the volume?

61
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Yes?

62
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Multiplied by u?

63
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's actually h, yes, multiplied by u at point a minus h times u at point b.

64
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So it's going to be a and b, right?

65
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Okay, so that means the time derivative of h,

66
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I mean, here h times u is the flux.

67
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
The flux depends on not just h, but also some other quantities.

68
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Now, how about these other quantities?

69
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
How about the time derivative of rho times dx?

70
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
How does the momentum change in time?

71
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What is the momentum flux?

72
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's a little bit more complex, right?

73
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
rho h u squared.

74
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So first, there is a term, u h u squared.

75
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
That's basically the momentum itself times u.

76
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
That's how much momentum is going,

77
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
that's the momentum carried by the fluid going into the volume, right?

78
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So that's one term.

79
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Interestingly, there is another term that wouldn't be here if there is no gravity.

80
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:44,000
The gravity is going to create a pressure force that acts on surface a and surface b,

81
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
and the pressure force is going to create a momentum.

82
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's going to create a source term in the momentum,

83
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
but because the pressure only applies on the two interfaces,

84
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
it can be written as a flux.

85
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And that flux is going to be the average height of the column.

86
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So if you take the center, that's the average height.

87
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Why would you want that?

88
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Because the slope, if u is already a sub-circle,

89
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
you can be fine, right?

90
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You say momentum is now going to be a g xت

91
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:35,000
so you waste the zero Eastern gain so you mention,

92
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:43,040
y själv ist noch ein Ü 小

93
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,000
z quer auf einem finishes square,

94
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:52,160
to 0, and the partial rho uh, partial t,

95
00:07:52,160 --> 00:08:01,320
plus partial x of rho hu squared plus half of rho gh

96
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,180
is equal to 0.

97
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,240
Oh, yeah.

98
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,820
This is because if you try, if you integrate the pressure

99
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:17,620
force over the column of water, the pressure

100
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,580
is equal to 0 at the top, right?

101
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,120
So there is no pressure at the top.

102
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,600
The pressure at the bottom is rho gh.

103
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,060
Oh, actually, there is, because there is an integral,

104
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,020
we have a square.

105
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:29,920
Yeah, sorry.

106
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,880
We have a square here.

107
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:37,120
Right, so we are integrating the pressure at the bottom

108
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,000
is rho gh.

109
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,940
And we are integrating over a height of h.

110
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:51,620
So the total pressure force is half of rho gh squared.

111
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,260
Right.

112
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:00,280
So now if you say this is not in standard conservation form,

113
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:09,240
because there is a weird rho hu here, right, that

114
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:09,920
can be fixed.

115
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:09,960
Right?

116
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:09,980
Right.

117
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,560
So we can fix this.

118
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,100
So this is a simple way to do it.

119
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:18,340
So let's say we define this momentum equal to rho uh.

120
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:25,900
Then let's rewrite these two equations as the following.

121
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:36,660
So the hu is going to be partial x of m divided by rho, right?

122
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,440
Rho is a constant.

123
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:39,940
And.

124
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:50,220
Partial m, partial t, plus we also write the flux as just a function of m and h.

125
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:59,340
So in this case, we have a u square, which means we have to square this m.

126
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:03,580
By squaring m, we have rho square, u square, h square.

127
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:08,460
So to get this rho hu, we need to divide by rho and divide by h.

128
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:08,900
Right.

129
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,400
Right.

130
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:09,980
Right.

131
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:13,020
Right.

132
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:22,080
The second term is, can be just written as half of rho g times h square is equal to zero.

133
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:29,180
Now both equations are written in terms of either constants, like rho and g, and these

134
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:32,260
two conservative quantities, h and m.
