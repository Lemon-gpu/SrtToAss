00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Okay and one last thing I want to just tell you in two dimensions is how do we integrate arbitrary functions.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So how do we evaluate the integral of v and f for a known but arbitrary function f on the right hand side.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
In one dimension, how did we do that?

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We had Gauss quadrature, right? So we represented this as, approximate this as a summation of wi times vxi and fxi, right?

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
In two dimensions, we can do exactly the same thing.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
But the Gauss quadrature points and weights are going to be adapted to the two dimensional form.

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So in a triangle, there are two dimensions.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
There are very good, very nice Gauss quadrature points.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So in a triangle, there are points that are going to give you very accurate quadrature for like for triangle elements.

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And for other elements, you can also get it.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And one of the actually very active and still very difficult points for further research is

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
how do you come up with good quadrature points for arbitrary functions?

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And for example, people are starting to think about how do I apply finite element to the kind of mesh we dealt with in finite volume.

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Remember in finite volume, we can use really arbitrary types of mesh.

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Like we looked at triangular mesh.

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:56,000
We also looked at this kind of adaptive mesh environment where one element can interface with many different elements.

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So we can use many different, many different other neighboring elements.

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:11,000
But deriving a quadrature scheme for this kind of arbitrary elements, which may shape like that, right, can be pretty difficult.

19
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And how to do this is still quite an open question.

20
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So that completes our finite element discussion.

21
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And there is going to be another project out today.

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So there is also no lecture on Wednesday.

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So I'll see you.

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So the next lecture is going to be next Monday.

25
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
All right.

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Any questions?

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What if f has a divergence in the element?

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
How do you integrate that?

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What if f has a what?

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
A divergence, like an infinite delta function.

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
How do you integrate that?

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
If f has a delta function, then the integration is going to be like this.

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
The integration of a delta function with v is going to be just the value of v at that point.

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And because v is a piecewise linear function, that's actually easy to do.

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Right?

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Like you do a quaternary, you kind of, you don't know that even.

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Exactly.

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
If you, quadrature only works for smooth, at least continuous f's.

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
If you don't have a continuous f, then you split it into continuous pieces.

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
If you have delta functions, pull the delta function part out of the f.

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And then use quadrature on the continuous, single, and continuous f.

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
On the smooth portion of f.

43
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
On the non-smooth portion of f, you do something else.

44
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Quadrature, don't use quadrature on delta functions or non-continuous functions.

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Okay.

46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
All right.

47
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Professor.

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Yes.

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I found out the other day that my friend actually works for Professor Laccarino.

50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Oh, Laccarino?

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yeah.

52
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Okay.

53
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Isn't he your advisor?

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yeah, he was my co-advisor at Stanford.

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Yeah.

56
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Cool.

57
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Yeah.

58
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
He, I think you gave a talk.
