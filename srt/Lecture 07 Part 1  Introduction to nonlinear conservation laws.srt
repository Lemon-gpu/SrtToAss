1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The reason we use finite volume is really because of nonlinearity.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So if you think of all the examples we did in finite difference, most of them, at least on the differential operator, it is linear.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So when we go to nonlinear conservation laws, we are going to see that finite difference doesn't work anymore.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And we'll see, first of all, why.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So I'll give you, first of all, a general form of nonlinear conservation laws, and then we give you specific examples.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So in one dimension, a nonlinear conservation law looks like this.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:57,000
A time derivative of u plus the spatial derivative of not u itself, but a nonlinear function of u, equal to 0.

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:08,000
A more general form is that it is equal to an algebraic function of u, but let's think of this as 0 for now, at least in this lecture.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The nonlinearity lies within F.

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And can somebody think of an example of a conservation law that we have touched about in previous lectures?

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So for heat equation, we have a second derivative of x, which means that F cannot be an algebraic function, but a differential operator.

12
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
That's also fine, but this is not the simplest type of conservation laws we are going to be talking about here.

13
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Conservation of mass, right, so this actually can be used to model conservation of mass, where F of u, if u is density, we'll talk about later that this is conservation of mass.

14
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But a very simple example we have touched about previously is F of u is equal to u.

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What kind of equation is that?

16
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
That's just a linear vector equation, right?

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And in this lecture, we'll just use a slightly different example.

18
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's equal to u squared, for example.

19
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Actually, to make our life a little bit easier in the derivation, we make half of u squared.

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
That's called the Burgess equation.

21
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So the Burgess equation is really a prototypical nonlinear conservation law that is very, very simple.

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It has the simplest form of nonlinearity, just a square.

23
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
If you remove the square, it'll be just a linear vector equation, what we've discussed before.

24
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Something that works perfectly, we find a difference.

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And now with the square, we see things start to break down, we find a difference.

26
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So before we discuss why things break down, we find a difference, let's first look at three different forms of the differential equation.

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And we'll see some form gives us better intuition, some form actually doesn't give us good intuition about the solution of the differential equation,

28
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
and sometimes lead to strange contradictions.

29
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
The first form is something we know how to deal with and find a difference.

30
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
If you take chain rule on this term, what do you get?

31
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
df du times du dx, right?

32
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So if you apply chain rule to this, we get the so-called primitive form.

33
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's partial u partial t plus df du.

34
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Times partial u partial x is equal to zero.

35
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
That's the primitive form.

36
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
In terms of the Berger's equation, what is it?

37
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
What is df du?

38
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's just u, right?

39
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So the Berger's equation is taking our linear vector equation before and replace our previously big u, which is a constant, with the small u, which is not a constant, it's actually the solution.

40
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So one way to interpret the Berger's equation is,

41
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
it's just a linear vector equation with a varying advection speed.

42
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And this advection speed is basically proportional to the solution value.

43
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
If the solution locally is positive, the wave goes towards the right.

44
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
If the solution locally is negative, the wave goes towards the left.

45
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So we will see in the MATLAB case, for example, if we type Berger's equation.

46
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And I would like somebody to come to our initial condition, trying to verify our initial interpretation of the Berger's equation.

47
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Can somebody come and do an example of initial condition that tries to see if we can verify or disprove

48
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
what we thought the Berger's equation would give you?

49
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Go from inside, yeah.

50
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Alright, thank you.

51
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So now we are seeing how the Berger's equation is evolving.

52
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So the rate of evolution is pretty slow, so let's see if we can see the waves moving.

53
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Okay.

54
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So you can see like the positive side is actually slowly moving towards the right.

55
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And on the left hand side I'm drawing a space-time plot, x-axis is x, y-axis is t.

56
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And I'm drawing the solution as a color contour.

57
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So you can see the positive side is actually moving towards the right.

58
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So previously this discontinuity was to the left, and now it's moving towards the right of this x equal to 1.

59
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And this, for example, should move towards the left of x equal to 1.5.

60
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So let's wait until this discontinuity crosses x equal to 1.5 to make sure it is actually moving towards the left.

61
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Right, now it's almost crossing.

62
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So what we were guessing was correct.

63
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:45,000
But we have almost a linear advection equation whose wave is advecting according to the local solution value.

64
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
But there are also something that is not the same as before.

65
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:01,000
That is, if the advection speed is dependent on the solution value, then the wave no longer maintains its original shape anymore.

66
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So we see the wave actually distorting and becoming different from what you draw as the initial condition.

67
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:19,000
In addition to that, we also see some of the original discontinuities expanding into a fan,

68
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
and some of the original discontinuities actually joining towards one stronger discontinuity.

69
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So this discontinuity is called shock waves.

70
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And this is a nonlinear conservation law that doesn't actually appear in the linear differential equations.

71
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Alright, so let's stop this simulation for now.

72
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And go back here.

73
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So this is the primitive form that gives us a little bit of insight on how the waves are moving.

74
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So think of this as a wave speed.

75
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:08,000
For any differential equations, for any conservation equations with a different f,

76
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
we can always derive how does the wave speed depend on the local value of the solution u.

77
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
For example, for this example, the very first example, the wave speed is always equal to 1.

78
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And for the second example, the wave speed depends on the solution in a linear fashion.

79
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So now, the second form, the conservative form, is actually what I have written down here before.

80
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So the conservative form is partial u, partial t, plus partial fu, partial x equal to 0.

81
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And for the Burgess equation, it's partial u, partial t, plus partial partial x,

82
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
of u squared over 2 equal to 0.

83
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Now the reason we call it a conservative form is because it is used to derive the integral form,

84
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
which really tells you why this is called a conservation law equation.

85
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So, integral form.

86
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
The integral form is taking the conservative form and integrating it over an interval.

87
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So, integrate from a to b, a is less than b, partial u, partial t, plus partial f, partial s.

88
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
This over dx should equal to 0.

89
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Right?

90
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Now, in the integral form, our a and b are fixed, independent of t, independent of u.

91
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
So they are just fixed numbers.

92
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Two arbitrary fixed numbers with a.

93
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:02,000
So, with the fixed 9 by 8 integration, that integral commutes with time derivative.

94
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:12,000
As long as a is not dependent on t, b is not dependent on t, then you can exchange the integral and the derivative,

95
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
and make the time derivative outside.

96
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
So the time derivative of the integral becomes the first term.

97
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Okay?

98
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
And the second term is the integral over a derivative in x.

99
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Can we simplify that?

100
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Fundamental law of calculus.

101
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:40,000
That is, f evaluated on b minus f evaluated on a.

102
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Right?

103
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Right?

104
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
So, think of what does this mean.

105
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Let's write it in a maybe clearer way to illustrate how this means.

106
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So, I'll move this term to the right hand side.

107
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'll write it f minus f .

108
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
The time derivative of the integral of the solution over a range

109
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:25,000
is equal to the flux, f is called the flux, at the left of the range minus the flux at the right of the range.

110
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
So somebody mentioned conservation of mass.

111
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Right?

112
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,000
If, for example, the solution u is some kind of density,

113
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
density of mass, density of electrical charge,

114
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
density of energy, density of momentum,

115
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
density of energy, density of momentum,

116
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
density of momentum, or something.

117
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Right?

118
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
If u means density, then the integral means what?

119
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
The integral of the density over a spatial domain means what?

120
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Means the total mass, or total energy, or total momentum, or total electrical charge, or something.

121
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Right?

122
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
The total amount of stuff inside this range.

123
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And d dt is the rate of change.

124
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
The rate of change of the total mass inside a volume.

125
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It's equal to the rate of flux going into the volume minus the rate of flux going out of the volume.

126
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
So this is why it means a conservation law.

127
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Because the integral form really tells you the conservation of some material over a volume.

128
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Alright?

129
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
So, for example, for the Berger's equation,

130
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
we get d dt integration over an arbitrary domain.

131
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And for the integral form to be an integral form,

132
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,000
it has to be over an arbitrary pair of time independent points.

133
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Would be equal to

134
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
u b squared over 2 minus u a squared over 2

135
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
squared over 2 is equal to 0.

136
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
So that'll be the integral form of the Berger's equation.

137
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Okay, questions so far?

138
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Oh, why did I turn the partial derivative in time to just a plain derivative?

139
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
This is because when you write u, u is a function of x and t.

140
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
So once you integrate over x, the dependence on x goes away.

141
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So the integral of u over a and b is only a function of x and t.

142
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
So the integral of u over a and b is only a function of x and t.

143
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
That's why it's just a notation.
