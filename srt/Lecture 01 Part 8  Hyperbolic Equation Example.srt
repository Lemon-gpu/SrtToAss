1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,800
Okay, so the third limiting case is hyperbolic equations. So that is when

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:14,520
Kappa, what we take as the primary driver for the spatial derivative to 0, we also

3
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:21,420
take f equal to 0. We have the equation partial u partial t plus a big U

4
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:31,660
partial u partial x equal to 0. This equation has a very interesting

5
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:41,220
analytical solution and let's just draw it from MATLAB. So if I, for example, if I

6
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:49,340
take Kappa equal to 0 and big U equal to 1. So I'd like to have somebody again to

7
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,400
draw an initial condition and see how the solution

8
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:59,680
evolves. Can we have somebody to draw an initial condition again?

9
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,680
Yeah, please.

10
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,380
All right, thanks. So this is the solution to

11
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:29,300
the case where U is equal to 1 and Kappa is equal to 0. What we see is a linear

12
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:35,960
translation. The solution keeps the original shape but just translates

13
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:47,660
towards the right. Can we analyze that also from the differential equation itself?

14
00:01:51,380 --> 00:02:01,380
We can put Fourier analysis again. That's right. So let's express U again as a function

15
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:10,940
of x and t using a summation. I'm going to not write K. It goes from minus infinity to

16
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:17,660
infinity. And then the spatial derivative is going to be operated on. So this is the

17
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,660
derivative.

18
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,660
So this is the derivative.

19
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,660
So this is the derivative.

20
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,660
So this is the derivative.

21
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,660
So this is the derivative.

22
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,660
And then the spatial derivative is going to be operated on U .

23
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:34,920
So we get an i k in front of this. And the time derivative is going to be operated on

24
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:41,100
U only. And we get this.

25
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,340
Right?

26
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,940
So the solution we get is d U hat of K d t.

27
00:02:48,940 --> 00:03:13,940
d t plus i k big U times U hat of K is equal to 0.

28
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,940
So this...

29
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:17,940
Also...

30
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,940
So this...

31
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:19,940
This equation has the same...

32
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:24,440
This is another ordinary differential equation.

33
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:29,940
And the form of this equation is exactly the same as what we have been seeing before.

34
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:40,940
It is U hat of K is equal to U hat of K at time 0 times e to the minus i k t...

35
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,940
i k t...

36
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,940
i k u t.

37
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:44,940
Oh, i k u t.

38
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:45,940
Oh, i k u t.

39
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:46,940
Oh, i k u t.

40
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:47,940
Oh, i k u t.

41
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:48,940
Oh, i k u t.

42
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:49,940
Oh, i k u t.

43
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:50,940
Oh, i k u t.

44
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:51,940
Oh, I k u t.

45
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,940
Oh, I k u t.

46
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:53,940
Oh, i k u t.

47
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:54,940
Oh, i k u t.

48
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:55,940
Oh, i k u t.

49
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,940
So how does this solution look like?

50
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:08,140
It's a sinusoidal oscillation.

51
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,440
Right?

52
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,940
So the solution for every component oscillates in a sinusoidal way.

53
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,940
We will have several thousand ways, two ways to swinging parall uniforms.

54
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:15,940
And so it's in sin��릴 Agriculture.

55
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:16,940
It's shaftics.

56
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:29,980
and the period of the oscillation is going to be it's going to be 2 pi over

57
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:41,340
uk right so the higher the k the smaller the period is and if you can decompose

58
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:45,020
the solution into different Fourier modes the different Fourier modes would

59
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:54,780
oscillate periodically in different rates and the higher the the slower variation in space is going

60
00:04:54,780 --> 00:05:03,260
to also oscillate with slower frequencies in time and the composition of all these oscillations

61
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,980
forms a linear translation in space

62
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,900
so in fact you can another way to analyze this

63
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:14,780
is

64
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:31,820
is the fact that this u of x and k x and t can always be written as a function of g of x minus u

65
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:41,020
times t when you take the derivative of this function with respect with respect to time

66
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:44,540
so

67
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:49,660
you get minus u times g prime the derivative of g

68
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:55,260
you take the same derivative to x you get just a g prime the summation of these two

69
00:05:55,260 --> 00:06:03,260
where the space derivative is multiplied by u is going to give you zero so this kind of solution is

70
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:09,420
exactly a linear translation in time okay so now we're going to look at the next step

71
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,740
which is the derivative of g prime

72
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:14,380
so we're going to look at the next step which is the derivative of g prime

73
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:21,260
so these are the three Leibniz cases of this convection diffusion equation

74
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:29,660
and all of these cases can be analyzed pretty easily using analytical methods

75
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:35,020
and the combination of them becomes quite interesting for example

76
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:43,420
if i put a big u of one and cup of point one what do you think you're going to see when i do an initial condition

77
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:52,940
if i put a big u of one and cup of point one what do you think you're going to see when i do an initial condition

78
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:57,900
so it'll be a translation and gradually becomes a constant let's see that

79
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:09,100
okay that's perfectly right there is a advection towards the right but during that action

80
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:13,580
it becomes smoother and smoother and ultimately becomes a constant

81
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:24,140
and we can try different things we can put it as 0.01 and we should see the same speed of translation but

82
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:30,300
the speed where it goes to a constant should be decreased

83
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:37,660
so we can see that now it maintains this oscillatory wave for a bit longer

84
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:43,100
and when we draw a different u

85
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:52,140
a u of equal to 10 for example what should we see in this case

86
00:07:52,140 --> 00:08:01,500
i'm trying to draw the same initial condition we see the translation becomes a lot faster right

87
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,580
what if we draw a negative u in this case

88
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:11,900
minus two what do you think is going to happen

89
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:19,260
so we can see that the translation goes towards the left

90
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,420
so we can see that the translation goes towards the left

91
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:25,740
okay and i think you had a question what if we put a negative kappa

92
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,420
let's try that minus 0.1

93
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:38,220
huh oh didn't even allow me to draw this that shouldn't happen

94
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,220
let me see

95
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,220
okay

96
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,540
let's try this

97
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,540
okay

98
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,540
uh oh

99
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:59,100
that's what happens when you have a instability okay so so things becomes

100
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:05,100
okay so let's try that

101
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,100
like that

102
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:14,460
i never tried it so let's see how it goes

103
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:18,540
so i do see something before it goes

104
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:22,540
before it goes to infinity so okay the thing to remember is that

105
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:26,540
this minus point whatever how many zeros one is multiplied by k

106
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:30,540
square and k when you discretize

107
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:34,540
when you discretize a condition of k

108
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,540
you can see that the function of k is the same as the function of k

109
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:42,540
so if you have a condition of k and you have a condition of k

110
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:48,940
then you discretize a continuous signal using fourier series

111
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:56,620
but the largest k can be pretty large right so so let's say if you have if you

112
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,100
have a thousand grid points distributed across the spatial domain

113
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,100
from zero to two pi

114
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,820
then the largest k can be on the order of like a thousand

115
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,540
and this thing no matter how small is multiplied by k square and for the

116
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:12,140
mean- 언�straight lines this thing no matter how small is multiplied by k square and for the

117
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:12,540
mean- 언�estraight lines this thing no matter how small is multiplied by k square and for the

118
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:17,160
the largest k even though this one is small you should expect to have a very

119
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:22,580
fast divergence to infinity.

120
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:34,340
That's a good point if we have a very smooth initial signal. Oh I think I may

121
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:42,220
not be able to draw it smoothly exactly at the boundaries. Sorry I think

122
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:48,580
because it's periodic so usually the discontinuity at the boundary is going

123
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:52,180
to introduce some high frequency components even though I draw it very

124
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:56,360
very carefully so it's pretty difficult.
