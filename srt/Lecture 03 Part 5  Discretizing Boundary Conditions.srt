1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,920
We only talked about u0 is equal to a fixed value, let's say y.

2
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:16,300
And in this case, this boundary condition is going to appear in our right-hand side.

3
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:30,680
And d dt of my solution u vector is equal to a matrix times u vector plus a constant term.

4
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:39,000
And the constant term u0, the u0 is going to appear here as u0 over delta x squared.

5
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:40,940
Okay.

6
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,000
And today we are going to introduce the...

7
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,480
Newman boundary condition.

8
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:54,060
So this is called the Dirichlet boundary condition under the name of a mathematician.

9
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:02,300
And we are also going to talk about Newman boundary condition, that is du dx at, let's say, x equal to 1.

10
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,080
The right-hand side is equal to, let's say, z.

11
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,340
This is called Newman boundary condition.

12
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,080
Newman boundary condition is going to affect...

13
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:20,300
the discretization of the right-hand side.

14
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:27,300
So the partial derivative of u at x equal to...

15
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:41,300
at x, let's say, n minus 1 is going to be discretized as u of n plus u of n minus 2 minus 2u n minus 1 divided by delta x squared.

16
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,300
Right?

17
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,300
Okay.

18
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,300
Okay.

19
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,300
Okay.

20
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,300
Okay.

21
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,300
Okay.

22
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:56,300
And we already said that one way to discretize this is saying u n minus u n minus 1, a consistent

23
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:03,300
way of discretizing this, which means delta x goes to 0, the approximation error goes to 0.

24
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:10,300
This can be used to approximate the derivative.

25
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,300
Now we know this is equal to z.

26
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:24,300
So that establishes a linear relationship between u n and u n minus 1.

27
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:42,300
So if we plug this into here, what we get is u n is going to disappear and become u n minus 1 plus z delta x.

28
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:47,300
And plus u n minus 2 minus 2 u n minus 1.

29
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:55,700
So you can collect these two terms and instead of minus 2, I'm going to erase this and this

30
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,300
becomes minus 1.

31
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,300
Right?

32
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:05,540
So that's one way of dealing with the Newman boundary condition, which instead of setting

33
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,300
the value to something, you set the derivative to something.

34
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,300
So that's only an x equal to 1.

35
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,300
Right?

36
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,300
Okay.

37
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,300
So what's the x equal to 1?

38
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,300
The Newman boundary.

39
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:18,300
The Newman boundary condition, this is when I'm setting the boundary condition at the

40
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:25,300
right, when at the last point.

41
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:30,300
If I have a Newman boundary condition at the left, it's similar.

42
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:35,300
I'm going to use u 1 and u 0 as opposed to u n and u n minus 1.

43
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,300
Right?

44
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,300
Okay.

45
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,300
So if you look at this.

46
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,300
Okay.

47
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:46,060
So if you look at this formula, this has two effects.

48
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,300
One effect is there a z term.

49
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,300
Right?

50
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:56,020
So z over delta x, which is going to go to the constant term in this equation.

51
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,300
All the others are 0.

52
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:05,980
Second is that it is modifying the coefficients of u n minus 1 specifically.

53
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,300
So all the rest of this scheme get minus 2 over delta x.

54
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:15,300
Minus 2 over delta x square.

55
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:21,060
But the last, very last one is going to get minus 1 over delta x square.

56
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,920
Right?

57
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:29,060
All the other terms stay the same.

58
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:34,500
Right?

59
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,060
So it is modifying this.

60
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,060
Okay.

61
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,060
So it is modifying this.

62
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:43,960
And it is also adding that.

63
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:50,060
So Newman boundary condition has the effect of both modifying the matrix and adding something

64
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,060
on the right hand side.

65
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,060
Yes?

66
00:04:54,060 --> 00:05:03,060
So you have a first order approximation for the boundary condition, but that costs the

67
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,060
whole solution, the first order algorithm?

68
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,380
That's a very good question.

69
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,060
So here I have a first order approximation.

70
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,060
Okay.

71
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,060
So I have a first order approximation just on one point.

72
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,060
Right?

73
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,060
And for many equations, including this one.

74
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,060
So the answer is equation dependent.

75
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,060
For this particular equation, it will not affect the quality of the entire solution.

76
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,060
Right?

77
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,060
But that's only for specific equations.

78
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,060
You have to do analysis for different equations.

79
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:35,060
And if you just want to be safe, you can derive a second order approximation for the boundary

80
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,060
condition also.

81
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,060
All right.

82
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,060
Any other questions?

83
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:43,060
So is that n by n now as opposed to n minus 1?

84
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:52,060
This is still n minus 1 by n minus 1 because we get u n minus 1 and u n minus 2.

85
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,460
An alternative way.

86
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,720
So there is a lot of ways to deal with boundary conditions.

87
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:03,000
A different way is to extend the solution all the way to u n.

88
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,060
And if you do that.

89
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,060
. .

90
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,560
You should be using both.

91
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:15,900
I mean you can use both the differential equation and the boundary condition to derive the evolution

92
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,740
of the last grid point.

93
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,740
D u n d t.

94
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,120
Yeah.

95
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,300
If you want to take that approach, we can talk about that.

96
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,300
All right.

97
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,300
Yeah.

98
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,300
You have a question?

99
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,300
Yeah.

100
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,300
So z is just now a function of time.

101
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,300
Right?

102
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,460
Z, yeah, is just another function of time.

103
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,460
That's right.

104
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:34,960
Okay.

105
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,060
Yeah.

106
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,060
.

107
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:47,100
If you use a center difference to approximate the derivative at u n, it actually changes

108
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:52,800
things because it will involve u n plus 1.

109
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,980
And u n plus 1, there is no way you should include u n plus 1 in the solution.

110
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:03,060
So in order to cancel u n plus 1, you also need to discretize the differential equation.

111
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,060
. .

112
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:10,000
The differential equation, the heat equation at u n itself, at the right boundary.

113
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,760
So now you have a differential equation, you have a boundary condition, both involves u

114
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,140
n plus 1.

115
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,560
Use them to cancel it.

116
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,060
So that's how you would do it if you want to use center difference.

117
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,060
.

118
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,060
Any other?

119
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,060
.

120
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,060
.

121
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,060
Pardon?

122
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,060
.

123
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,060
.

124
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,060
.

125
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,060
.

126
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,060
.

127
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,060
.

128
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,060
Pardon?

129
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,060
.

130
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,060
Sorry?

131
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,060
.

132
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,060
.

133
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,060
You would have another term in the Q represent that's both at the right

134
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,060
boundary different.

135
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,060
Yeah.

136
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,060
Okay.

137
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,060
So let me say.

138
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,060
So alternative, .

139
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,060
.

140
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,060
Is.

141
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:53,380
. I'm also going to derive the equation for d u n d t, which is equal to u n plus

142
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:59,640
1, minus u n minus 1, plus u n minus 1, minus 2 u n.

143
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,060
. And I have the central difference approximation.

144
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:07,480
over 2 delta x equal to z, right?

145
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:14,160
So that means u n plus 1 is equal to u n minus 1 plus 2 z delta x.

146
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,240
I plug it into here.

147
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:22,340
That will give me u n minus 1 plus 2 z delta x.

148
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:29,880
So that is replacing u n plus 1 plus u n minus 1 minus 2 u n over delta x squared.

149
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:37,260
So we're going to see instead of combining with u n, we're combining with u n minus 1.

150
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,580
So we are still going to change both the matrix and right-hand side, but in a slightly different way.

151
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:49,920
We are also adding the vector by one additional entry to include u n also as a variable to solve.

152
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:58,900
So that's the best way to do it when you want to use a central difference to approximate the derivative.
