1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,640
it diffused out it diffused out it's almost as if we are solving not the

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:15,540
advection equation but an advection diffusion equation exactly so why why is

3
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:23,280
it the case let's go back to our numerical scheme and look at when we

4
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:29,600
discretize this equation using this way we know it is a consistent

5
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,520
discretization to the equation we want to discretize and consistent means as

6
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:40,560
Delta X goes to zero the the error the error in this discretization in this

7
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:45,780
approximation goes to zero in first order this particular case but it turns

8
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:52,560
out the same discretization may be an even better approximation to an advection

9
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,260
diffusion equation

10
00:00:53,280 --> 00:01:00,180
which makes the behavior of the code like that so let's look a little bit

11
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:07,160
into actually is that the case how do we figure out how do you think we figure out

12
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:15,680
when we look at an accuracy of a scheme what do we do

13
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:23,040
Taylor series exactly okay so the only non-trivial Taylor series is this one

14
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,260
Taylor series exactly okay so the only non-trivial Taylor series is this one

15
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:30,940
right so that's an easy case ui minus 1 is equal to ui which is you are which is

16
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:37,260
delta x away minus delta x times ui prime so that's a shorthand for first

17
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:47,700
derivative plus Delta x square over 2 ui double prime minus Delta x cube over 6

18
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:53,120
ui triple prime etc right so I should just

19
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:58,820
wrong addition salty unfiltered just a right all tidak top of just uh right o

20
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:03,720
delta x to the fourth or here that means the rest of the terms the case at least

21
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,820
as fast as Delta X to the fourth now we gave 아주 to use to find out what the

22
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:12,360
matrix use Islamicик rules product us to test task or work to find as soon as

23
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,940
right so we have this term we have minus delta x to the fourth over here that

24
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,980
means the rest must be case at least as fast as data x to the fourth now with

25
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:22,820
beginners along the tutorial you're

26
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:33,320
x ui prime plus delta x prime ui double prime minus delta x cube over 6 ui

27
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:41,600
triple prime I'll just ignore the rest so so because O Delta x fourth divided

28
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:47,600
by Delta X how can I write this as O something so if I divide O Delta x

29
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:57,260
fourth by Delta X it's gonna be Delta x cube right because if this is a term

30
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:02,500
that decays as Delta x to the fourth if I divide that term by Delta x one

31
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:10,160
Delta x cancels I get Delta x cube okay this is equal to 0 so now we look at

32
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:17,120
this equation and factor out this Delta x oh we have a minus on the whole thing

33
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,560
okay

34
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:22,760
we have a minus on the whole thing because it's minus okay plus u Delta x

35
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:32,180
Delta x cancels we get our dui DX let me write as partial because now we are back

36
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:38,380
with the spatial derivatives so that's that's the term that approximates this

37
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:46,400
equation but then we look at the next term what is it it's a minus Delta x over

38
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,120
2

39
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:58,220
of big U times partial square u partial x square right we also have a term plus

40
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:09,200
Delta x square over 6 u partial cube ui partial x cube that is equal to Delta x

41
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:16,000
cube very high order so this term is like it's very small when our Delta x is 2 pi over 100

42
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,960
so this term is like it's very small when our Delta x is 2 pi over 100

43
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:25,260
So this discretization we are using is actually an better approximation so so

44
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:29,240
this term is also small let's not let's ignore this term for now it's a better

45
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,040
approximation to this equation which if you move this term to the right-hand side

46
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:41,900
it's a diffusion term what's interesting is that it's a diffusion term so so let's

47
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,420
see

48
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:46,100
this is the diffusion

49
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:46,180
üll

50
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:46,880
byочку

51
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,880
right or some people call it dissipation

52
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,380
because it dissipates like the peak of

53
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:04,400
any wave signals so this term is

54
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,040
proportional to delta x which means if

55
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,920
you have a big delta x this term is

56
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,380
stronger if you have a small delta x this

57
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:18,920
term is weaker right so let's test it to

58
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,860
see if that is the case so here we used

59
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:26,180
n equal to a hundred if you use n equal

60
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,720
to 200 the dissipation is going to be

61
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,760
half as strong

62
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:40,100
let's see if that is the case so now my

63
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,360
I want to say my x is equal to

64
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:49,500
0 to 199 divided by 200 and the rest I

65
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,400
think I'll just do the same u0 is the

66
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,900
same I would do od45 the same now it

67
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,280
discretizes a time domain using 400 and

68
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,480
something time steps right and if you

69
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,020
remember the CFL condition we derived in

70
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:10,480
the last lecture the first order

71
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,400
derivative

72
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,300
delta x

73
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,240
is divided by 2 delta t should also

74
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,420
approximately be divided by 2 that's why

75
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,900
you see slightly more than the doubled

76
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,060
number of teeth

77
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:29,940
we already held on and let's plot this

78
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:34,260
solution not using red now but X you

79
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:41,340
let's do it as green

80
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:48,540
so less dissipation right so how do we

81
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:52,080
know it's half as much dissipation let's

82
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,340
solve it for twice that long let's solve

83
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,500
it for full price so that these waves

84
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,500
should be at back to through two times

85
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,220
the domain and he's almost a double so

86
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,540
so let's plot this using we already had

87
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,180
blue green red

88
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:17,660
let's do huh black hmm okay okay the

89
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,900
black one is almost the same as the red

90
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,060
which means the dissipation is almost

91
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:29,000
half as large right yes what change did

92
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,940
you make to create the green solution

93
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:36,200
what does change between initial red I

94
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,540
doubled the number of grid points so

95
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,120
this is the step this is the step is that

96
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,380
of 0 to 99 divided by 100 I did 0 to 199

97
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:48,140
divided by 200 that's the only thing I

98
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,900
changed and the rest is the same this

99
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,120
step this step this step is the same
