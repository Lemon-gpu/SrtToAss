1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,260
Questions so far? And it turns out, in this case, there is a very interesting transformation you can do.

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:19,100
There is a very interesting transformation you can do either at this point or even before we start this projection.

3
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:29,320
Okay, this is the transformation we can do either here or here.

4
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:40,780
So let's perform the transformation here to see that this transformation, basically integrating the residual of the equation with a smooth function,

5
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:50,100
is going to help you relax the differential equation, weaken the requirement of the differential equation a lot.

6
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:55,180
This transformation is called integration by parts.

7
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,240
Okay?

8
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,180
And this...

9
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:07,880
If you forget about integration by parts, I'm going to remind you here.

10
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:19,340
So remember, we were trying to integrate a smooth function times a differential equation.

11
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,480
Right?

12
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,460
And let's focus on the first part.

13
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,480
And the integration of parts is going to really...

14
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:40,480
relax the differential equation in the sense that if you look at the strong form of the differential equation, the differential form, it requires you to be how smooth?

15
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,960
It has to be at least second order differentiable, right?

16
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:57,880
If you remember last time, we looked at two examples of approximating a known function with a piecewise linear function.

17
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,120
Okay?

18
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,220
Okay.

19
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:58,280
Okay.

20
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:58,320
Okay.

21
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:58,380
Okay.

22
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:58,440
Okay.

23
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:58,460
Okay.

24
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:58,500
Okay.

25
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:58,560
Okay.

26
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:58,620
Okay.

27
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:58,640
Okay.

28
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:58,660
Okay.

29
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:58,680
Okay.

30
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:58,720
Okay.

31
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:58,740
Okay.

32
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:58,780
Okay.

33
00:01:58,780 --> 00:01:58,800
Okay.

34
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:58,860
Okay.

35
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:58,920
Okay.

36
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:58,960
Okay.

37
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,020
Okay.

38
00:01:59,020 --> 00:01:59,040
Okay.

39
00:01:59,320 --> 00:01:59,440
Okay.

40
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:16,920
Okay.

41
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,200
Okay.

42
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:24,220
Okay.

43
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:24,540
Okay.

44
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:24,560
Okay.

45
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,060
Okay.

46
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:25,160
Okay.

47
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:26,920
Okay.

48
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:26,960
Okay.

49
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,420
Okay.

50
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:27,620
Okay.

51
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,360
Okay.

52
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:28,700
Okay.

53
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:28,760
Okay.

54
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,240
Okay.

55
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:29,320
Okay.

56
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:36,920
to integrate the residual of the equation with a smooth function, or at least a piecewise

57
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,920
smooth function.

58
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,380
It is going to relax the requirement on you by integration by parts.

59
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:48,520
So integration by parts really comes from the following.

60
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:57,440
It comes from the fact that if you differentiate the product of two functions, in this particular

61
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:05,380
case, these two functions are g and du dx.

62
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:13,260
If you take the derivative of a product, how do you expand it?

63
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:23,400
Yeah, it's the derivative of the first term multiplied by the second term, right?

64
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,600
So this is the derivative of g, this is the second term.

65
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,440
Plus g.

66
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,080
Times the derivative of the second term, which in this case turns out to be a second-order

67
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,760
derivative.

68
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:43,780
Okay, now when we integrate both sides of the equation over space, the left side of

69
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:49,340
the equation is an entire derivative, is a whole derivative.

70
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:56,600
So integrating the derivative of something in space is going to give me just two endpoints.

71
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,360
Oh.

72
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:04,760
So the question is, d dx of the derivative of u, is it the second-order derivative?

73
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:12,620
In this case, yes, because in this case, it is actually ODE.

74
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:16,060
We only have one independent variable x.

75
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:20,740
So in this case, I should actually be writing du dx.

76
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:24,760
So everything is just the ordinary derivative here.

77
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,820
So I'm just writing partial here because of the derivative of u.

78
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,320
Okay.

79
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,460
So the derivative of u is just the second-order derivative.

80
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:33,680
Anyway, maybe because this class is about PDs.

81
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,000
But like the derivative here, taking twice is just the second-order derivative.

82
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Yes.

83
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,560
Any other questions?

84
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,080
Okay.

85
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,440
So if we integrate over the left.

86
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,440
Okay.

87
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,440
Okay.

88
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,440
Okay.

89
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,000
Okay.

90
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,440
Okay.

91
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,440
Okay.

92
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,440
Okay.

93
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,900
So, this is the first-order derivative of x.

94
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,160
We have a derivative of, of, which is inside the derivative of x equal to 1 minus the same function at x equal to 0.

95
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:18,400
And while the right-hand side, while the right-hand side, so this is equal to the integration

96
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:24,820
of 0 to 1, the first-order derivative of g times the first-order derivative of x equals

97
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:25,440
1 to 1.

98
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,080
Okay.

99
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:26,600
Okay.

100
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,080
Okay.

101
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,380
Okay.

102
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,880
plus the same integral g partial square u partial x squared.

103
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,820
Now look at this equality here.

104
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,600
One term in this equality, so we have three terms,

105
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,920
this is equal to this plus this.

106
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:53,920
Only the blue term requires u to be second order differentiable.

107
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,040
So if we can somehow transform the equation using this equality here,

108
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:08,480
if we can transform this equation using this equality here,

109
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:13,520
by replacing the term g times second order derivative of u

110
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,940
as the difference between this term and this term,

111
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,300
between the two red terms,

112
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:25,940
we are going to derive an equation that only requires u to be first order differentiable.

113
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:27,940
Right?

114
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,340
The only requirement on here is that g is also first order differentiable.

115
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,600
So by multiplying an equation with a smooth function,

116
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,040
we can relax and integrate.

117
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,280
We can relax how smooth the solution has to be.

118
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:57,160
Okay, this is a tool that has been used a lot.

119
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,820
In functional analysis.

120
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,040
Okay, so let's do that.

121
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,620
Once we perform that replacement,

122
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:09,720
what we get is integration from 0 to 1,

123
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,380
g times x dx,

124
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:21,880
plus g times du dx at 0 and 1.

125
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,640
Okay.

126
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:25,760
Okay.

127
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,660
Okay.

128
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,160
Minus integration 0 to 1,

129
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:37,360
partial g partial x plus partial u partial x is equal to 0.

130
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,760
So all the following up derivation are going to be the same.

131
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:45,780
Okay.

132
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,200
So we can,

133
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:54,400
we are going to be replacing g with phi j,

134
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,460
with the individual basis functions,

135
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,400
because this,

136
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,280
this equality has to be true for any g within a certain space.

137
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:07,940
And therefore this equality has to be true also for the individual basis functions in the same space.

138
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,380
So it is equivalent if we use g or use phi j,

139
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,960
because if the equality is true for all the phi j's,

140
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,160
then any linear combination of the phi j's has to be satisfying the same equality.

141
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,960
We are going to replace the u by a summation of u i,

142
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,440
phi i.

143
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,000
And we collect the terms,

144
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:37,960
we move the summation and the u i's out of the integrals,

145
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:43,820
and we are going to derive a u plus b equal to 0,

146
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,640
where the a's,

147
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:56,200
the a's are almost the same as what we derived here.

148
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,200
It is,

149
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,400
it is going to be the,

150
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,360
minus the integration from 0 to 1,

151
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,120
partial phi j,

152
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,120
partial x,

153
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,360
times partial phi i,

154
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,400
partial x,

155
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,160
dx,

156
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:18,120
plus phi j times partial phi i,

157
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,040
partial x at 0 and 1.

158
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,560
So the reason I said the trick can be also applied over here is because if you

159
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,320
perform integration by parts on this one,

160
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:35,440
you're going to get the same formula as what we have over here.

161
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,480
Right?

162
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:47,520
This is simply integration by parts if these phi i's are smooth from this equation.

163
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:55,760
But the advantage of deriving from starting from here is that we know that once we perform that transformation,

164
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:02,680
we know that the solution u i's doesn't have to be twice differentiable anymore.

165
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:10,880
And here we can choose the basis functions to be something which does not have to be second order differentiable.

166
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,140
Yes?

167
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,480
Why do you have equal to 0 and the blue term doesn't?

168
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,840
Oh, the blue term doesn't equal to 0.

169
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:25,140
Sorry, I should be circling the blue term to be,

170
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:25,640
sorry,

171
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,260
this.

172
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,520
So I'm saying you can replace because,

173
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,000
oh,

174
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,260
okay.

175
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:33,760
So yeah,

176
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,060
there is not equal to 0.

177
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:35,340
Yeah,

178
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:35,760
thank you.

179
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,520
So what I'm trying to say is this is equal to this plus this.

180
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,680
So there is no equal to 0.

181
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:40,920
Yeah,

182
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,340
thank you.

183
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:45,800
Right.

184
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,600
So this is derived from this integration by parts formula.

185
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:51,840
The blue line,

186
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,960
the blue term can be because,

187
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,720
because the left hand side,

188
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,060
is equal to the right hand side,

189
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,520
which is the sum of two terms.

190
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,760
If you integrate both left and right hand side,

191
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:10,640
this red term comes out of the integration of the left hand side and the red term and the blue term on the right hand side comes from integration of the two terms on the right hand side.

192
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,140
There shouldn't be a equal to 0 here.

193
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:14,880
Yes?

194
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,760
I think it must be the first red,

195
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,060
the first for the red equation.

196
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:22,880
Yes.

197
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,560
First term,

198
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,140
what is it?

199
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,760
Should be g times f.

200
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:32,380
Should be g times f.

201
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:32,840
Yeah,

202
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,100
yeah,

203
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:33,680
sorry,

204
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,520
g times f.

205
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,880
So it comes from,

206
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,420
comes from this equation,

207
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:37,920
right?

208
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:39,380
Yeah,

209
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:39,960
thanks.

210
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:42,960
Any other questions?

211
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:43,420
Yes.

212
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,640
Are we sure that we are applying the basis of this school?

213
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,140
In the case of the,

214
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:55,060
in the case of the continuous sun-Earth space.

215
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:55,640
Yes.

216
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:01,140
Are we sure that we are applying phi theta as the first derivative?

217
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:01,720
Oh, I see.

218
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,380
So, so you are asking,

219
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:11,840
are you asking in the case that the space is continuous and piecewise linear functions,

220
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,000
can we find a basis that is smooth?

221
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,760
So, yeah, that's a good question.

222
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,560
What do you think?

223
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:25,340
If we have a space of continuous and piecewise linear functions,

224
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:30,000
should all the functions within the space be differentiable or not?

225
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,540
No?

226
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,540
And so you are right in the sense that they are no longer differentiable at the grid points,

227
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:39,840
right?

228
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,580
At the grid points,

229
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,040
you can define a derivative,

230
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:49,300
but can you still evaluate these aijs by integrating the first order derivatives?

231
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:54,340
The first order derivative is only undefined at the grid points,

232
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:54,840
Yes.

233
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,300
right?

234
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:55,920
Yes.

235
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,960
And that doesn't affect this integral.

236
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,140
Okay, that's good.

237
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,220
And divide this integral.

238
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:09,260
Exactly, because we can divide this integral into the integral on these elements,

239
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:15,000
where the boundary of the elements are the grid points on which the derivative is not defined.

240
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:24,840
So, yeah, we can, we can still, for any function within that piecewise linear and continuous space,

241
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,100
we can perform this integral.
