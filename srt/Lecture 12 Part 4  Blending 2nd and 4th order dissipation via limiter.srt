1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So the GST scheme is a scheme that chooses in between these two...

2
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:18,840
So we know that adding a dissipative flux proportional to delta x cubed times the third-order derivative of u

3
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,100
is appropriate for smooth regions of the solution.

4
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:30,400
And adding what we added before, a dissipation proportional to the second-order derivative,

5
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:36,660
a much stronger dissipation because it's proportional to delta x instead of the much smaller delta x cubed,

6
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,160
is appropriate around shock waves and the local extremis.

7
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:48,420
So the GST scheme is simply a scheme that chooses in between them

8
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,080
according to the same limiter we have been using to reconstruct the solution.

9
00:00:53,100 --> 00:01:07,820
So the first step is to construct a limiter phi that is equal to 0 or 1

10
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:17,280
if 0 is non-smooth and 1 is smooth, and they can also go in between.

11
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,520
So we can use the same limiter we used in our scalar conservation law.

12
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,520
And second step...

13
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:30,100
is to construct a second-order derivative...

14
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:37,500
so second-order dissipation flux,

15
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:46,440
which is proportional to the first-order derivative times the maximum value of the characteristic speed.

16
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:53,080
And third step is to construct a numerical dissipation proportional...

17
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:59,020
to the third-order derivative that is going to give us a fourth-order dissipation.

18
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:05,020
And then combine them using the value of phi.

19
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:12,020
In such a way that if phi is equal to 1, then we are purely using the third-order derivative.

20
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:17,020
And if phi is equal to 0, we are also going to be using the first-order derivative.

21
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:22,020
Alright, so for example, we can...

22
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,020
we can multiply...

23
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,020
we can have this value, the third-order derivative...

24
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:38,020
to be also always times 1, and the second-order derivative to be times 1 minus phi.

25
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:43,020
And that gives us the appropriate behavior of...

26
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,020
when phi is equal to 0, we turn on the stronger dissipation.

27
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:51,020
And when phi is equal to 1, we turn off that stronger dissipation.

28
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,020
So that's...

29
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,020
that's what...

30
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:57,940
that's how the GST scheme deals with system of conservation laws.

31
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:03,940
Achieving second-order accuracy, but still being non-oscillatory around shock waves.

32
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:08,940
It computes the limit of the same as what we compute before.

33
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:16,940
Based on local extremis and the ratio between slopes between different solutions.

34
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:20,940
And construct a second-order and fourth-order dissipation.

35
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,940
And perform linear conservation.

36
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,940
And then we can use the combination of them,

37
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,940
trimming the second-order on and off,

38
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,940
according to the value of the limit.

39
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:37,940
So this is the most advanced material we are going to go into in finite volume schemes.

40
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,940
So with this...

41
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:43,940
this also applies for...

42
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,940
this also applies for multiple dimensions.

43
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,940
The only difference in multiple dimensions is that...

44
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,940
the gradient reconstruction.

45
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:58,860
So here, we are constructing the gradient by just taking the difference between two adjacent cells.

46
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:04,860
In multiple dimensions, you need to take more than two cells to reconstruct a gradient.

47
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:13,860
Usually you take multiple cells around you and perform a least squares type of estimate for the gradient value.

48
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,860
Because in 2D, for example, the gradient gives you two values, right?

49
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,940
So in x and in y.

50
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:20,860
But like the number of...

51
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:26,860
the number of surrounding cells may be more than two.

52
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,860
So...

53
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:34,860
so you have more equations to satisfy than unknowns when you are trying to calculate the gradient.

54
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:39,860
If you have exactly two adjacent cells, like in a...

55
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:44,860
then you can solve two equations for two unknowns, being the gradient.

56
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,860
If you have many, many cells around you, you have an over-determined system,

57
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,860
and you use these squares...

58
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,860
to get the gradient.

59
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:56,860
But all the other stuff are the same.

60
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,860
Okay?

61
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,860
In multiple dimensions.

62
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,860
Yes?

63
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:10,860
I'm not very clear how to use the signature to decide how to do the third-order dissipation.

64
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,860
Oh, that's a...

65
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,860
that's a good question.

66
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,860
The third-order dissipation can be always wrong.

67
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:17,860
That's...

68
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,860
that's something...

69
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,860
that's the simplest way to determine...

70
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,860
the third-order dissipation.

71
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:22,860
Right?

72
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,860
It's always wrong.

73
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,860
Because if we don't have a shock wave, it's...

74
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:32,860
it can be there, providing stability while giving us at least a second-order accuracy.

75
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,860
When shock wave is...

76
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:42,860
when you're around a shock wave, it's also okay to have this term in,

77
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:47,860
because the second-order proportional to delta x term is gonna be over-realmedialized.

78
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,860
Okay?

79
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:54,620
overwhelmingly strong so you don't have to you don't have to diminish the third

80
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,380
order term when you're around the shockwave
