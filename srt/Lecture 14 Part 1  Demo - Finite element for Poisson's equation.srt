1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
So remember last lecture we were solving the Poisson's equation, the partial

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:14,760
derivative of u to x squared plus a known function f is equal to zero. What

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:21,840
we did was we integrated this equation with another function, a test function, an

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:28,140
arbitrary function, arbitrary smooth function. We integrate that over the

5
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:34,060
whole computational domain. So let's say from A to B, that has to be equal to 0

6
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:40,840
for any V within the certain class of functions. We'll make this certain class

7
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:52,440
more rigorous pretty soon.We integrate by parts so if we have u at 0 and 1 both

8
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,980
equal to 0 then the boundary term that goes into the integrate by parts

9
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:58,120
A and b su 무엇 holy well n the boundary terms that goes into the integrate well by parts

10
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:06,820
is going to be 0. What we have left is a minus sign of the derivative of v times

11
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:18,300
the derivative of u dx and the other term is v times f is going to be 0. This

12
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:29,820
is integration by parts and afterwards we represent the u as a summation of

13
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:41,220
basis functions and we substitute v with also one of these basis functions and

14
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:47,980
from this we pull the summation out of the integral what we get is minus

15
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:48,280
f.

16
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:57,940
The summation ui of integration of a to b the derivative of i, vi the derivative of vj

17
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:07,960
is going to be equal to integration of v times vj of x dx equal to 0.

18
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:17,960
And if we call this matrix to be aij and this vector to be bj what we get is a ui

19
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,520
equal to b.

20
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:26,480
Right? And we solve this and we get the solution as a linear combination of

21
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,840
basis functions. We also started using the basis functions that are piecewise

22
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:41,680
linear and continuous so the basis functions are these head functions. We

23
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,020
derived the formula of aij and bj and let's now start putting them into

24
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:47,640
computer to see how they work. So we have a formula of aij and bj and we derived the formula of aij and bj and let's now start putting them into computer to see how they work.

25
00:02:47,960 --> 00:03:05,180
We started with b, and bj, all the way from the basic model is in the terms of the

26
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:05,980
object.

27
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:10,640
Before I showed you in the past how to do things in f, we had alreadyrades all the

28
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,440
products, but satisfied requirements of the first method.

29
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,780
So let's also show that by doing this aij will solve all fundamental questions.

30
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,120
This is how aij is blanked.

31
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,640
So we start with b.

32
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,740
something between 0 and 1, which is random.

33
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:26,080
And what I will do is I'm going to make a 0 at the first grid point

34
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,680
and sort x and 1.

35
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:34,920
So the result is x is going to be increasing,

36
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,360
but the spacing is random.

37
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:38,480
All right.

38
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,600
So what I will do is I'm going to construct the matrix A.

39
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:49,460
A is going to be 0s and minus 1,

40
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,580
only corresponding to the interior grid points.

41
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,240
These are the each AIJ correspond to a pair of basis functions.

42
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:06,260
And the diagonals of A would be equal to

43
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,800
the diagonals of A is equal to 1 over

44
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,260
1 over

45
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:19,640
xi minus xi minus 1 plus 1 over xi plus 1 minus xi.

46
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,740
That's the formula we derived in the last lecture.

47
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:29,700
So it's going to be a diagonal of 1 over x.

48
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:37,460
It is going to be 3 to n minus x of 2 to n minus 1.

49
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,860
So that's the first part.

50
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,280
That's the second part, actually.

51
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:50,800
And the first part is going to be the interval on the left of this grid point.

52
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:55,980
So it's going to be 2 to n minus 1 minus 1 to n minus 2.

53
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,180
I think I'm missing one more bracket.

54
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:03,980
Parenthesis.

55
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:06,800
Still.

56
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:06,920
Still.

57
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,480
I put 1 too many.

58
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,100
See.

59
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,220
OK.

60
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,040
Good.

61
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:23,420
So A is going to be a matrix whose diagonal is filled.

62
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,660
Right?

63
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,340
OK.

64
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:29,620
Now let's fill the upper and lower diagonals.

65
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:40,640
To fill the upper diagonal, we need what we need is the interior delta axis.

66
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,220
So from 3 to n.

67
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:42,720
So from 3 to n.

68
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,100
So from 3 to n.

69
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:43,600
So from 3 to n.

70
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,600
And minus 1.

71
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,100
Sorry.

72
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:52,200
X.

73
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,440
So these are the delta axis in the interior.

74
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,660
2 to n minus 2.

75
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,920
And we are going to shift it by 1.

76
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,700
So we are filling out the upper diagonals.

77
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,340
And we also shift the same number by minus 1.

78
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,280
We fill the lower diagonals.

79
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,920
And what we see is that we are constructing a matrix.

80
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,720
Oh, sorry.

81
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,420
I should be.

82
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:12,920
OK.

83
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:20,660
So

84
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,360
Sorry

85
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:21,880
Sorry

86
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,320
Sorry

87
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:22,780
Sorry

88
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,280
Sorry

89
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:23,940
Sorry

90
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:24,440
Sorry

91
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:24,940
Sorry

92
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:25,440
Sorry

93
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:25,940
Sorry

94
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,620
Sorry

95
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:26,680
Sorry

96
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,280
Sorry

97
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:27,780
Sorry

98
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,300
Sorry

99
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:28,800
Sorry

100
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,300
Sorry

101
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:29,800
Sorry

102
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,300
Sorry

103
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,300
Sorry

104
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:32,800
Sorry

105
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,240
Sorry

106
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:33,540
Sorry

107
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,140
Sorry

108
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:34,360
Sorry

109
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:34,860
Sorry

110
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:35,160
So

111
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:35,660
OK.

112
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,180
So

113
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,620
Now you see that you need a November soul

114
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,920
in the reducung system.

115
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,380
Right.

116
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,040
So

117
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,880
Let's do it again.

118
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:42,920
OK.

119
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:47,460
So let's also make the number b.

120
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:53,980
So the bi is a vector that depends on...

121
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,180
Sorry, this should be...

122
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:00,100
I substitute v equal to this, so this should be f times vj.

123
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,840
So the bi depends on the right-hand side of the equation f.

124
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,960
It's f times vj integrated.

125
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:13,980
So in the case, let's say if f is equal to 1,

126
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,780
then bj is going to be...

127
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:22,460
We also derived it's half of xi plus 1 minus xi minus 1.

128
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,800
So it's the average between two intervals.

129
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,800
So that is going to be...

130
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,800
b will be...

131
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,800
b...

132
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,340
Let's see.

133
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:48,340
So b is going to be 0.5 times x of 3 to n,

134
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:55,620
which is xi plus 1 minus 1 to n minus 2,

135
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,040
which is xi minus 1.

136
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,340
So we now have a b that is...

137
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:06,340
size of b...

138
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,020
That is 9 by 1.

139
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,980
So we have the correct shape of a and b to solve for u.

140
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,160
To solve for u,

141
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,500
we simply do u is equal to a backslash b.

142
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,400
So that solves the equation a, u equal to b.

143
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,020
And we get a bunch of u's.

144
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,500
u is going to be...

145
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,260
Sorry.

146
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:36,880
u is also going to be a 9 by 1 array.

147
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,560
And u is going to be a 5 by 2 array.

148
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,820
These are the linear combination coefficients for the hat functions.

149
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,440
So how do I visualize the solution?

150
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,640
Remember, for the hat functions as basis functions,

151
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:02,040
the value of the function at the grid points are exactly the linear combination coefficients.

152
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:06,040
So in order to plot...

153
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:16,500
solution we simply put X and U with zeros at the ends. So now this is our

154
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:24,360
solution. This is what our solution looks like. Alright, so this is our solution of

155
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:30,720
the equation the second-order derivative of U plus a constant 1 is equal to 0

156
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:38,420
with bounded conditions being 0 at the two ends. And let's make it clearer by

157
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:46,340
putting the dots. So this is a piecewise linear function and

158
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:53,700
the circles are where the grid points are. Now let's see how accurate our

159
00:09:53,700 --> 00:10:00,700
solution is. This particular equation with F equal to 1 has analytical

160
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:10,400
solutions. So for this equation with F equal to 1,

161
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:15,800
what do you think is the analytical solution? It's a parabolic, yes, and that

162
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:23,880
both sides are equal to 0. So what kind of parabolic is it going to be? It has a

163
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:30,700
curvature of minus 1, right? So you need a half and both sides are equal to 0

164
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:40,840
so it's really X times 1 minus X. The second-order derivative is the second-order

165
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:45,220
derivative of minus half of X square which is going to be minus 1. And this

166
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:53,200
also satisfies both being 0 at the two ends. So let's plot it on top of the

167
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:59,840
solution, numerical solution, to see how it looks like. So we'll do hold on and X

168
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,680
finds...

169
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,060
Let's say link space of 0 to 1.

170
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,320
Let's do 1,000 wrong points.

171
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:16,440
And the legal solution is going to be 0.5 times x times 1 minus x.

172
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:23,460
And let's plot x fine and u fine to see what it looks like.

173
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,540
So we do get a pretty good solution on the set of random points.

174
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,100
Right?

175
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:37,180
The red solution is the analytical solution, and the blue one is the numerical solution.

176
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:38,320
Okay.

177
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:45,780
So on the grid points, the approximation is pretty good, but within the intervals, of course, we have piecewise linear approximation.

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,260
So we have approximation error here.

00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,460
Questions so far about this?
