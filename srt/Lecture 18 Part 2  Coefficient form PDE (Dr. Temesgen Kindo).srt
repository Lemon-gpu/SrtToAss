1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,160
So what we will do is we will start with a quick introduction of PDEs, how we

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:14,240
interpret PDEs in ComSol, and solve a simple problem, then go back and start

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,960
with an algebraic equation, go to ordinary differential equations, go back to

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:26,680
partial differential equations, and solve a bigger coupled problem. So in ComSol

5
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:34,720
there are, for the PDE interfaces, you have options between coefficient form, general

6
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:43,240
form, and WIP form. So the coefficient form and the general form are ways to

7
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:50,420
basically put in your equations using the strong form of your PDE. Well once

8
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:54,680
you have that, the software uses the finite element method to solve this

9
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,600
equation. So in the background it's

10
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:56,660
going to be a little bit more complicated, but it's going to be a little bit more

11
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:00,940
complicated. So in the background it's going to be a little bit more complicated, but it's going to convert them into a WIP form. But if you

12
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:07,540
already have your own WIP form, you can directly put in the WIP form as well.

13
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:13,160
Most people use the coefficient and general form, but sometimes the WIP form

14
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:22,520
gives you more flexibility. It's the strongest form anyway in terms of giving

15
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,580
you flexibility and being faster.

16
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:32,340
So let's say you're in your numerical PDE class, are you guys doing finite differences or finite elements as well?

17
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,740
Both, right? Okay, so you would have seen the WIP form.

18
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:56,500
Okay, so let's start with the coefficient form PDE. It works really with a template. So there is this big template which says, okay, if your independent variable, if your dependent variable, the variable you find to solve for, let's say you called it U, and you're going to call it U, so you're going to call it U.

19
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:08,580
Then you get this equation where you have to specify the mass term, E, the down-pinning or mass term, D, the diffusion coefficient, C, the flux coefficient,

20
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:26,480
convection coefficient, absorption coefficient, and source terms. And this can be fixed numbers or they can be functions of your special coordinates and time, but they can also be a function of the

21
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:45,300
unknown itself. So if they are a function of the unknown itself, for example, let's say you are solving a heat transfer problem where the conductivity is temperature dependent, then the diffusion coefficient there is not going to be constant, but it's going to be a function of the independent variable itself.

22
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:54,480
Or if you are having heat sources where the heat generation rate is temperature dependent or reaction rates being concentration dependent, then you can solve for the heat transfer problem.

23
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,500
Okay, so you have the heat transfer problem.

24
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:56,740
You have the heat transfer problem.

25
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:56,760
So if you have the heat transfer problem, you have the heat transfer problem.

26
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,280
So if you have the heat transfer problem, you have the heat transfer problem.

27
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:06,620
Then the source terms will not be fixed, but they will be functions of the unknown itself, and you are going to have an unlinear problem.

28
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:15,540
So once you specify all of these terms, if you don't have them, you put them to zero.

29
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:25,000
So, for example, if you are solving paramodic equations such as heat transfer or chemical reactions or groundwater flow, you don't have this mass term.

30
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,260
You don't have the second time derivative.

31
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:26,480
It's not a mass term.

32
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,980
So you would specify zero for E, and then you'd specify the other values.

33
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,940
So there are two units you want to specify here.

34
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,100
You have to specify the units for the independent variable.

35
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:56,240
Probably you guys being now doing a lot of mathematics like to do all of this in a non-dimensionalized manner, but a lot of engineers, they want the units, and they have data in certain physical units.

36
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,000
And they just want to use that directly.

37
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:07,040
So if you're using the dimensions, then you have to specify the unit for the independent variable and for the source term.

38
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,000
Now, we have a lot of terms here to be entered in this equation.

39
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,640
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

40
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:22,480
We have eight terms, but we are saying specify the units for the source term F and for the independent variable.

41
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,000
Why not specify the others then?

42
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,600
How is that enough?

43
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,180
How is it enough to specify two units for just two quantities when you have multiple terms in your equation?

44
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,580
How would it fill in the rest?

45
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,540
It would.

46
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,100
How do you think it will?

47
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,120
You're specifying the units for the independent variable?

48
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,200
Okay.

49
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,280
So here is U and then the source term in this equation, F.

50
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,240
Yeah, right, from dimensional consistency.

51
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:17,640
Basically, for example, if you think about the absorption term, the units of A multiplied by the units of U should be the same dimension as F.

52
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:22,440
So all of these others will be filled in from dimensional consistency.

53
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,100
And that basically makes it consistent.

54
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:33,880
Instead, if we allow people to change, to specify all of them, you can end up specifying an inconsistent set of units.

55
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:49,000
And the source form also uses that to track, for example, if it was expecting something in one unit, you specify your data in another unit, then it will complain that there is a unit that's expecting one unit and you are specifying another unit.

56
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So it works by basically looking at, you write your equations first and you compare it with the template.

57
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,200
And you fill it in.

58
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:57,960
It's that easy.

59
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:13,020
So, for example, if you think of this template, all of these problems from acoustics, chemistry, finance, or population dynamics, you can fit them into this template.

60
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:24,760
If you start with the acoustics equation, we don't have B, but the EA would be 1 over root C squared, where rho is the density and C is the speed of sound.

61
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:29,760
Or if you're doing chemistry, you don't have EA.

62
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,120
EA would be 1.

63
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,960
The independent you are solving for, U, would be concentration.

64
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,960
C would be a diffusion coefficient.

65
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,560
If you have advection, beta would be your advection velocity.

66
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,040
And then F would be your reaction rate.

67
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:53,040
Or if you are doing a population model, like say the Fisher Ecological Model, then U would be your population size.

68
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,240
You don't have E.

69
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:54,740
You don't have E.

70
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,040
So, you have E, A.

71
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,920
D, A is 1.

72
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:03,160
C is basically the migration rate.

73
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:16,880
And then A can be basically formed out of the burst rate or the net burst rate and then the carrying capacity.

74
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:23,300
So, you know, R, U, over K carrying the carrying capacity minus 1.

75
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,240
So, you basically.

76
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:30,760
You basically look at your equation and see how does it fit into any of that template.

77
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:37,240
So, the same way that once you specify the equations, you have to specify the boundary conditions.

78
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,480
And the boundary conditions also come in templates.

79
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:45,440
And the way the boundary condition templates work is you will see something on the left hand.

80
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,280
It gives you something like left hand side is equal to right hand side.

81
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,880
And you're going to enter the right hand side.

82
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,400
So, for example, the Grishley boundary condition.

83
00:07:53,400 --> 00:08:01,440
The template is U is equal to R or whatever your intended variable was is equal to R.

84
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:08,240
So, if you want to put a 0 for the boundary condition everywhere, then you basically pick

85
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,080
Grishley and then for R, you basically say R is equal to 0.

86
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,800
So, that's the template.

87
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:20,400
Or if you are having a more complicated one, we have something called a constraint.

88
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,400
The constraint basically says 0 is equal to R.

89
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:29,640
So, then what you have to do is put the expression that needs to be 0 at the boundary.

90
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:38,240
And that is R. And then where there are others as well, but you pick the boundary condition.

91
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,080
Some of them you don't have to specify anything.

92
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:46,400
For example, if you are doing 0 flux or if you are doing periodic boundary conditions,

93
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,400
there is nothing more to enter.

94
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,400
You just have to specify where you have 0 flux.

95
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,400
So, that's the template.

96
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,400
Okay.

97
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:58,240
So, you can specify where you have 0 flux or between which boundaries you have periodicity.

98
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,840
But it's really picking from the template.

99
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,640
I will demonstrate this with an example.

100
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:12,080
So, for example, for the boundary conditions, let's say we want to have 0 normal component.

101
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,440
You are solving for U.

102
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,680
Let U be a vector.

103
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,640
And then the normal component of that vector is going to be 0 in some direction.

104
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,640
So, you have to specify that.

105
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,160
So, this happens, for example, in structural mechanics.

106
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:32,520
If you have rollers somewhere, then the normal displacement in that direction is going to

107
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,520
be 0.

108
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:39,400
It can slip tangentially, but it's not going to move in the direction normal to your boundary.

109
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:44,380
Or whenever you have symmetry, then you're going to have that.

110
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:48,060
Like symmetry in fluid flow, for example, would mean that the normal component of the

111
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,640
velocity in some direction is going to be 0.

112
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,640
Now, you can use this.

113
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,640
Okay.

114
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,640
So, you can use the constraint condition.

115
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:59,040
For example, it says 0 is equal to R. So, what you have to do is what should be R so

116
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,480
that you have 0 normal component.

117
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,480
That's what you have.

118
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:11,020
If R is basically the dot product of your solution with the outward normal, you just

119
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:18,320
type the right hand side for R. And that will basically mean a 0 constraint, 0 normal component.

120
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,400
Or if you had a convective flux, the template you get is here.

121
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,400
What you get is this.

122
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:29,160
What you have to specify is the two terms, G and Q. And then, for example, if you have

123
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:35,420
a Newton type cooling, then G is going to be your convection coefficient multiplied

124
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:40,800
by the ambient temperature, whereas Q is simply your convection coefficient.

125
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,800
So, this is how it works.
