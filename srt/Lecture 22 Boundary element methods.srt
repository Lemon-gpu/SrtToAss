1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
The last part of this PDE class we talk about integral equation methods and we have a

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:12,000
just as an outline of what we'll do in this section. I'm going to talk a little bit as an overview today

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and the ones that, how many of you are aero-astro? I should have asked the other way. How many are not aero-astro?

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So because most of the students are aero-astro and the thing that they mostly use for

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,000
aerodynamics are what are called potential flow theory and there you're solving surface integral equations

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
that calculate drag on aircraft and because of that we talk mostly about surface integral equations

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
but I'll also say something about volume integral equations for non-uniform materials, but not as much.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So we'll talk a little bit about integral equation basics. I'm going to give you the 15 minute, well, hour and a half

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
version of integral equation basics.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So I'm going to talk about integral equations today, which means I'll say a lot of things somewhat vaguely,

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
not technically very formally, to give you kind of a framework of what the whole subject is about

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
so you can hang the details as we go through it.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We'll talk next time about quadrature and cubature, so I'll give you a little bit of the theory of quadrature.

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Some of you have had an undergraduate numerical analysis class, may have seen some of these ideas before,

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
but I think you'll see them in this more linear algebra thing.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So algebraic context, you can more easily generalize them to newer methods.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Then we'll talk about first and second kind theory and probably the most important idea in this topic,

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
which is the Niestrom methods.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And these are the integral equation methods that pretty much everybody uses

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and they turn out to be much easier to implement than other choices you might make by just sorting through the literature.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Then we'll talk, after that we'll have most of the material we need to do, most of the problems on the problem set.

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'll talk a little bit about the theory of quadrature.

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
We'll talk about the issues about formulating integral equations,

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
then the potential theory of principal values and something called the radiation condition.

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And then we'll talk about some other issues about what are called first and second kind integral equations.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So when we mentioned in the early part of the course about second kind theory,

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
we're not very clear about, so if this is second kind, what's first kind and why is it harder?

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And I'll say a little bit about that.

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And in the last lecture, we'll talk about what are called fast solvers.

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
This is why everybody who's interested in integral equations is interested in integral equations.

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
When we're done with today, you're going to think, well, I have finite element methods,

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I have finite volume methods, and they generate sparse matrices,

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
which I can solve either iteratively or directly with fast methods.

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And I have these integral equation methods which generate dense matrices,

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
which are formally n cubed to solve.

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Why would one ever do that?

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And the reason is because in the last two or three decades,

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
fast solvers have turned those dense matrices into sparse ones.

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And they've turned those sparse matrices and brought those methods into very common practical use.

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So to try to give you all of that story in this one first class,

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm not going to do a perfect job of that by far.

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm just going to try to show you some of the main ideas

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
and some of the simple intuitions to keep in mind

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
as we talk about some of the more formal ideas.

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'll talk a little bit about exterior versus interior problems.

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
When you define elements or find out difference methods,

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
you're often talking about the interior problem.

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You have a domain, you have a boundary,

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
you know what the values are on the boundary,

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
and you try to figure out what the fields are in the interior.

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
But there are lots of problems that are exterior problems.

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So figuring out what the temperature is in your aquarium

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
based on the boundary conditions of what the heat flow is

54
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
and the temperature on the surface is an interior problem.

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Throwing an ice cube in the ocean and trying to figure out how fast it melts,

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
that's an exterior problem because the ocean is deferential.

57
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The ocean is, to first order, infinite.

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And then we'll talk about test function selection at this time,

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
and I'll say a little bit about some issues in 3D.

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
But again, this is going to be fast.

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's going to be a little vague, well, a lot vague.

62
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Don't try to get the precise details of everything.

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Here in this first class, it's to try to give you the structure.

64
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's to try to give you what are the big ideas.

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'll try to underline those carefully,

66
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
but there'll be some things that look like important details,

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
and if they are, we'll come back to them later.

68
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And if they're not, then don't worry that you didn't get them.

69
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
But it's really helpful to have,

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
for many of you who've probably never seen integral equations before,

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
certainly never seen numerical techniques for solving integral equations,

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
so you need maybe a little context for what kind of things you're doing.

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So as I said before,

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I don't have to put up with me pointing at the screen,

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
but they took away my green laser at the airport.

76
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
My green laser pointer.

77
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And I said, see, it says it's dangerous.

78
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Don't take your laser pointer to the airport.

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It was a nice green one, too.

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I don't have any more.

81
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So you have the temperature in the tank.

82
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You know the temperature on the surface of the tank,

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
or you know the heat coming into the tank,

84
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
or you throw an ice cube into a large bath.

85
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And maybe what you want to know is what's the heat distribution.

86
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So maybe you know the temperature on the tank,

87
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
and you want to know how fast heat's coming into the tank.

88
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You can calculate the heat flow by getting,

89
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
if you knew the thermal conductivity near the surface

90
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
and the normal derivative of the temperature near the surface.

91
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So if you're doing this with finite difference methods,

92
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:42,000
for a temperature in the tank,

93
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
so suppose I have heat flow.

94
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I have a domain omega and a boundary gamma.

95
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And suppose I know the temperature on gamma.

96
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So what kind of boundary condition is this?

97
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Dursley or Neumann?

98
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Dursley.

99
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Dursley.

100
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And spell Dursley how?

101
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
That way.

102
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I never remember whether it's an E or an L.

103
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's French.

104
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So suppose we have this problem.

105
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
How do we figure out what the heat flow is?

106
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Suppose I have in omega,

107
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
it satisfies the plus in of some potential,

108
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
is equal to zero,

109
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
and I have some thermal conductivity.

110
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
How do I figure out what the heat flow is into this tank

111
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
if I'm using finite difference methods?

112
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Well, the first thing is you set up a grade

113
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
of using finite element methods.

114
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Then what do you do?

115
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
How do you figure out what the heat flow is

116
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
once you've set that up?

117
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You're going to need the normal derivative

118
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
of the temperature at the surface.

119
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
How will you get it?

120
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
So you know what the temperature is at these surface points.

121
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
That is given.

122
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
How will you find the normal derivative of the temperature?

123
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Using the interior points.

124
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yeah, you use the interior points,

125
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
and you take differences.

126
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You can get dt gamma dn

127
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
by using finite differences.

128
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Or if you're doing finite element methods,

129
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
you can use the basis function

130
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
to un-differentiate those

131
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
and get the normal derivative.

132
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
But that's the way you think about solving

133
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
for this kind of thermal conductivity problem.

134
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
For integral equations,

135
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
we would do it a somewhat different way,

136
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
and I'm going to try to show you that in a moment.

137
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So we do heat distribution in the tank.

138
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
We set up the finite difference grade.

139
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
We solve for the temperatures everywhere inside.

140
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And if we only want the heat flowing to the tank,

141
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
how many of those temperatures do we actually need

142
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
when we do a finite difference method?

143
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
If we're interested in heat flow,

144
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
we only need the temperatures near the surface of the tank.

145
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
How many do we have to solve for?

146
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Do we have any nice way of solving

147
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
for just the surface temperatures?

148
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
No, we've got to solve for them all.

149
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
All right.

150
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So that's one of the things about volume methods,

151
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
like finite element methods or finite difference methods,

152
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
is they require that you discretize the entire volume.

153
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
That's one of the things we're going to be able to escape

154
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
using integral equation methods.

155
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
And the place where that becomes particularly annoying

156
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
is when the domain for which you're trying to get heat flow.

157
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So you're trying to figure out how fast an ice cube melts.

158
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's a famous problem.

159
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
That's one of the things they used to give to MIT freshmen.

160
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
They would show up,

161
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
and the big question would be,

162
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
how fast does the ice cube melt?

163
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And about 10% of the freshmen at MIT

164
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
would get it to within 10% of the time it took

165
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
and the rest would have no idea.

166
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
MIT gets an extraordinarily talented undergraduate pool.

167
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
We can do it by solving the exterior problem.

168
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
But the exterior problem is infinite in extent.

169
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
How do we stop the mesh?

170
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
At what point do we...

171
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I mean, we obviously can't fill all of infinity

172
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
with a finite difference mesh.

173
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
What do we do instead?

174
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So I have an ice cube.

175
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I know what its temperature is.

176
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It's sitting in the ocean,

177
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
which has a given thermal conductivity.

178
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And I want to know how fast the heat's leaving the ice cube.

179
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
How do I answer that question with finite difference methods?

180
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Yeah?

181
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So, again, no flux.

182
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Really far away, maybe.

183
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Yeah, so no flux.

184
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
So we're going to come back to...

185
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
This is one of the subtlest things I can honestly come back to.

186
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
If there's no flux, there's no heat leaving the domain.

187
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
So how does heat leave the ice cube?

188
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Where does it go?

189
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So your suggestion's a great one.

190
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Somewhere you have to truncate the mesh.

191
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You just had two choices as to how to truncate the mesh.

192
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You picked one, no flux.

193
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
What was the other one you could have picked?

194
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Zero.

195
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Yeah, you could have made the temperature zero.

196
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It's far enough away.

197
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
The ocean is like an isotherm.

198
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Eventually far enough away from the ice cube.

199
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You swim a mile away from the ice cube, the ocean's still had whatever it is, 37 degrees,

200
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
whatever it's sitting at.

201
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's not going to be affected by the ice cube.

202
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's probably good enough to put a fixed temperature.

203
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
But if you pick no flux, and I promise we'll come back to that, then you have this problem.

204
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And we'll talk about that later.

205
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
But for the moment, let's think about, okay, so we have to do this exterior problem.

206
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
We have to put all this exterior mesh, all these unknowns.

207
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,000
So we get far enough away where we can say the temperature is a fixed constant.

208
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
When all we care about are the values near the surface of the ice cube.

209
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's like a lot of work.

210
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Well, there are lots of problems like that.

211
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Problems where what you're interested in is the surface quantities, and you end up having to calculate quantities in a body, either in the interior or in the exterior.

212
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
For those of you who are at Rathstrom, which one do you always care about?

213
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Which surface quantity are you most interested?

214
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Well, two, actually.

215
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
What's one of them?

216
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Drag.

217
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Say again?

218
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Drag.

219
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Drag.

220
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So one of them is drag.

221
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So the air is flying through the, the plane is flying through the air, and you want to reduce the drag.

222
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
What's the other one you care about?

223
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Lift.

224
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Lift, all right.

225
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
So you can't do lift with a potential flux.

226
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
But you need to drag.

227
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Okay.

228
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
So, but there are lots of problems like that.

229
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And I have a few.

230
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Okay.

231
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
So, capacitance calculation.

232
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You have plates.

233
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You put a voltage across the parallel plates.

234
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And you want to know what's the capacitance.

235
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
All you have to do is figure out the surface charge.

236
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Well, maybe, you know, those of you who like, you know, I'm an electrical engineer, so this is the first thing I think about.

237
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Capacitance is, here is one of these little airbag accelerometers.

238
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It's actually one of the early versions of the ones.

239
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
That's the one.

240
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
The one you're looking at is one of the early versions.

241
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's now.

242
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
So if you ever, no, no, no, no.

243
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
If you're graduate students, you can't afford a car.

244
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
So you don't know what it's like to drive.

245
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
But if you did, you'd have an airbag in your car.

246
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And it would have an accelerometer in it.

247
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It's one of these little things.

248
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
And they, it's really important to know what the drag forces are.

249
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And you can compute these things.

250
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
But again, it's a complicated surface.

251
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
And you, all you care about are the drag forces on it.

252
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Well, that may not be all you care about.

253
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
But when you're trying to figure out how quickly it will move.

254
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
The one you're all very familiar with, although hopefully won't see much of it.

255
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
We won't see more of those in the very near future.

256
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And this is the surface of an integrated circuit.

257
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
So people who do capacitance calculations to figure out how fast a microprocessor is going to be.

258
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
They extract capacitance.

259
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
These very complicated geometries.

260
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It's hard to see here, but there are about 10,000 of those green wires.

261
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
They're all part of one interconnect.

262
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It's a signal being sent out in a microprocessor.

263
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And they use what are called fast methods to do these kinds of calculations.

264
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
All of them are exterior problems.

265
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
They all share this property.

266
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
The MEMS, the aircraft design, the signal line.

267
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
These are all exterior field problems.

268
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You care about the fields outside the conductor, outside the aircraft, outside the MEMS device.

269
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
The quantities you're interested in are on the surface of the device.

270
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So on the MEMS device, when an aircraft is dragged, if a signal line hits the surface charge, you can calculate the capacitances.

271
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,000
And one more thing we need for these integral equation methods is the exterior domain has got to be linear.

272
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It's linear in space invariant.

273
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:50,000
So we're not talking about problems where the outside domain is a gradually stiffening molasses.

274
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:57,000
So it's like water near you and it gets like molasses further away and it gradually varies.

275
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
We're not talking about problems like that.

276
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
We're talking about ones where the exterior problem is uniform.

277
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
So these come up a lot too, but not as much as you would think.

278
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And there are some new methods in this area for dealing with problems with spatially inhomogeneous problems.

279
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
So spatially inhomogeneous material, but we're not going to talk so much about those.

280
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,000
We only have about six lectures left and I can choose the topics.

281
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
All right.

282
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
So you have the tools you need to solve these problems.

283
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
The problem is if you have an exterior problem, we're interested in the quantity on the surface.

284
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You have to fill the entire exterior domain with a mesh so that you can calculate these surface quantities.

285
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
And it would be nice if you didn't have to do that.

286
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:50,000
If you could somehow figure out the surface quantities by not filling the entire exterior domain with mesh.

287
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
So I'm going to give you an example of one, a relatively simple one.

288
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:08,000
.

289
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
So suppose I have a circle.

290
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
My domain omega is a circle.

291
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And it may not look like a circle, but it has a meaning.

292
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:33,000
And I know that the value on the surface, the potential on the surface, everywhere in gamma is equal to one.

293
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
What's the field everywhere outside?

294
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:46,000
.

295
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Can you tell me what it is?

296
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
All right.

297
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
So you're thinking, all right, so now I've got to integrate over a circle.

298
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
And you're thinking about some, I remember, integration formulas.

299
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
No.

300
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
If we know outside that the plastic unit size equals to zero,

301
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I can generate a solution, a potential that satisfies this.

302
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
This is the differential of the PDE.

303
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:24,000
And I can generate that solution by putting a point charge in the center.

304
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:32,000
And if this were, instead of a circle, were, I'm actually going to think of it as a sphere.

305
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
.

306
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,000
And I want to think about the three-dimensional problem, because you're more familiar with that.

307
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:50,000
If this were a sphere and I had a single charge in the center, what's the potential due to that single charge?

308
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I have a charge at a point.

309
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Let's call this position x equals zero.

310
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
What's the potential due to that charge?

311
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Because it's one over the distance away from the charge.

312
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Yeah, so if I have a position x prime, and this is at x equals zero,

313
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
then this potential is q over what?

314
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
4 pi over .

315
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
All right, so now you're, so now there's a difference between, so I'm more of a mathematician.

316
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
So you can imagine, yeah.

317
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Yeah, so my, the 4 pi, I'm picking my units so that that disappears.

318
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
We're, at some point, we'll have to worry about the 2 pi's and 4 pi's,

319
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
but not at the moment.

320
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
So in some units, this is the potential.

321
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Is this correct everywhere outside?

322
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Does this satisfy the PBE everywhere?

323
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Well, so before we head on, let's look at a few slides ahead,

324
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
because we'll have some of the details on the slides.

325
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
So we have this point charge.

326
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,000
If this were 2D, the distance would be just the log,

327
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
there would be a log function instead of just this thing.

328
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,000
So in 2D, this 1 over r that you think of, point charge, a position outside,

329
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
in 3D, it's 1 over distance.

330
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,000
In 2D, it's this log of distance, which has a lot of counterintuitive properties to it.

331
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
So I don't usually use that in terms of examples,

332
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
but you should have in mind that the potential due to a point charge in 2D

333
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
is the log of the distance between the point charge and the place you're measuring it.

334
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And the way you can see this,

335
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
the way that this potential satisfies either in 2D or 3D,

336
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
these potentials satisfy the Laplace's equation.

337
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
How do you know?

338
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
How do you know this satisfies the Laplace's equation?

339
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:57,000
What formal theory do you appeal to to know this satisfies the Laplace's equation?

340
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
At any point except where the point charge is?

341
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
What would you do?

342
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
You could plug it into the PD.

343
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
You could plug it into the PD, right?

344
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
You could just differentiate it and see, does it actually equal 0?

345
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
And if you do that, if you go ahead and calculate the derivatives,

346
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
if you add them up in 3D for the Laplace's equation or 2D for the Laplace's equation,

347
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
you'll see if you laboriously differentiate it,

348
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:28,000
and this is something that you should do sometime eventually

349
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
to convince yourself that it really does work out,

350
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
because at some point, you know, the fact of the matter is that it just works.

351
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
So, you know, the distance turned out to satisfy the Laplace's equation.

352
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
You wonder, so how did they come up with the Laplace's equation in the first place?

353
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
And did they think of the Laplace's equation,

354
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
and then discover the point charges produced solutions to the Laplace's equation?

355
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Or did they think about point charges and then come up with the Laplace's equation?

356
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Well, that's Laplace.

357
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:00,000
But given that, that's not exactly the solution to this problem.

358
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
What have we left out?

359
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
So we now have, by the potential to this point charge,

360
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Q over X prime gives me the potential everywhere outside that sphere.

361
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
What's its value exactly on the sphere?

362
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Does it match my Dirichlet boundary condition?

363
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Well, what things do you need to know to figure that out?

364
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I said Q equal to one.

365
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Does that mean it matches potential at the surface of the sphere?

366
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
What are the points on the surface of the sphere?

367
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,000
What values of magnitude of X prime do they have?

368
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Is it a big sphere?

369
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Is it a little sphere?

370
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
What number do we use to characterize whether it's big or little?

371
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Radius.

372
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Radius.

373
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
So if we knew the radius of the sphere, can we figure this out?

374
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
If we knew the radius of the sphere in R is equal to 10,

375
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
can you tell me what Q is so that you get a potential that satisfies the boundary conditions

376
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:22,000
and the PD by picking a certain Q?

377
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
And what value of Q should that be?

378
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
10.

379
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
So that says that psi at Q over 10 should be equal to?

380
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
One.

381
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
One.

382
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
So that is, which means Q is?

383
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
10.

384
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
10.

385
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And that satisfies the boundary conditions.

386
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,000
So if we have a solution that satisfies the PDE everywhere, outside the sphere,

387
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
and matches the boundary conditions, are we done?

388
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Do we have the solution to the condition?

389
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Could there be another one?

390
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:15,540
Well, for the moment, if we assume something about what happens at infinity, and this is

391
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:19,180
one of these subtle things that you happen to trip over in answering the question the

392
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:22,760
first time that I'm not going to answer yet, but we will come back to.

393
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,500
But for the moment, we can think as long as the potential goes down to zero at infinity,

394
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,500
then we have a solution, right?

395
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,280
This potential goes down to zero at infinity.

396
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:34,300
It satisfies the boundary conditions.

397
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:40,700
So you give me any exterior domain.

398
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,700
It has a surface.

399
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:46,000
I put a point charge in the middle of that domain.

400
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,700
It produces a solution that satisfies Laplace's equation everywhere in three space.

401
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:55,700
And I just set its value so it matches the boundary condition.

402
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,940
It couldn't work.

403
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:58,940
You have one example.

404
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,940
It worked really well in the sphere.

405
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:00,260
It worked really well in the sphere.

406
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,280
What if this weren't a sphere?

407
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,280
What if it were an egg shape?

408
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,280
Did that still work?

409
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:13,560
What would go wrong if instead of a sphere I had an egg shape, and I said, the surface

410
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:22,100
on my egg, and ellipsoid, the surface on my egg is unit potential, and I want to use this

411
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,100
formula.

412
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,800
Will I get exactly the same potential from this formula?

413
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,800
Will it work for an egg?

414
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,940
If it works for a sphere, but it won't work for an egg.

415
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:36,940
We'll work for surface and bottle, surface and airplane.

416
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:40,940
Well, so we have this idea, right?

417
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:47,940
We put a point source in the interior, which is outside the domain of our interest.

418
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,940
Our interest is the outside problem, the exterior domain.

419
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:58,940
We put a point charge in the interior, and we can generate a solution that satisfies the Laplace's equation.

420
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:05,940
And that's great, except for this problem of the boundary conditions.

421
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:12,940
So it works really well if we put the point charge in the center of the sphere, and our domain is described by the surface of the sphere.

422
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,940
We're publishing them after, and all that will be sufficient.

423
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:20,940
But we are not. We are engineers, and we actually have to solve real problems, which are not, unfortunately, spheres.

424
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:27,940
Very few, for example, spheres will fly, unless they're filled with hydrogen or helium.

425
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,940
Thank you.

426
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:32,940
What do we do now?

427
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,940
So we have a square set.

428
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:41,940
Could we transform our problem so that it puts into a sphere, so it looks like you can just transfer?

429
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:42,940
So that's a great idea.

430
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:49,940
And there are all these techniques based on doing variable transformations to try to turn it into a sphere.

431
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:54,940
It's really hard to come up with a transformation that takes an F14 into a sphere.

432
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:57,940
It's a hard problem to do that transformation.

433
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:02,940
It doesn't mean there aren't lots of techniques for problems like this where you use that.

434
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,940
There are problems that...

435
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,940
So it's a very good technique.

436
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:09,940
Trying to come up with those transformations, particularly in 3D, is hard.

437
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,940
But that doesn't mean it's not a good idea.

438
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:16,940
But we're going to need something that maybe isn't so sophisticated.

439
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,940
So what else...

440
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:21,940
What if we put a second point charge in there?

441
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:24,940
Is the potential due to two point charges?

442
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,940
Does that also satisfy Laplace's equation?

443
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:32,940
If Laplace's equation has what property that means if I have one solution to Laplace's equation

444
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,940
and another solution to Laplace's equation,

445
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:39,940
their weighted combination is also a solution to Laplace's equation because Laplace's equation is?

446
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:40,940
Linear.

447
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:41,940
Linear.

448
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,940
Alright.

449
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:43,940
So...

450
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,940
But if we have two...

451
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,940
So we know how to do a sphere with one charge.

452
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:52,940
Now, if we were doing really a 2D problem and had the logarithmic green sub-tune,

453
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:53,940
we could do the same thing.

454
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:57,940
We could figure out what the magnitude of the point charge is,

455
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:04,940
just by making sure we matched the one boundary condition we have at this radius r.

456
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:05,940
So, provided...

457
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,940
Oh, we didn't just have to have a surface of the sphere.

458
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:11,940
We also had the surface of the sphere where the potential is uniform on the surface.

459
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,940
So that's really a very tightly concerned problem.

460
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:19,940
But if we have an arbitrary surface with an arbitrary set of points...

461
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,940
And now I'm going to start writing these things down in 2D.

462
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:26,940
And in fact, some of the problems are done in 2D because it's just a lot easier to visualize.

463
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,940
But I warn you, these logarithmic greens functions,

464
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,940
they're really hard to get your head around.

465
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:34,940
Because it means you're talking about problems that are infinitely long.

466
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:39,940
And when it comes to electromagnetics, that makes some degree of sense.

467
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,940
If you're talking about a flying aircraft,

468
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,940
I don't even know how you think about an infinitely long flying aircraft.

469
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,940
I don't know what these 2D things mean.

470
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,940
So, it's hard to develop intuition in 3-space,

471
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,940
but it's much easier to write the equation down.

472
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,940
So, I'm going to start with the first one.

473
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,940
It's much easier to write the equations down.

474
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:00,940
So, we're going to look at things like that,

475
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:05,940
but if you're trying to sort of intuit them by thinking of flow problems,

476
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,940
thermal flow works okay.

477
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:10,940
But I always find it a difficulty,

478
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:15,940
even though it's much easier to write down problems and do examples in 2D.

479
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:20,940
So, suppose we now have the potential as a weighting combination

480
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,940
of these potentials to the point charges.

481
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:25,940
So, we have each point charge is at some different point.

482
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,940
So, we have a different location in the interior.

483
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:31,940
We're going to sum over all those potentials due to all those point charges

484
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:34,940
and a log in front of it with a weighting coefficient.

485
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,940
We're going to sum those all up and they're all going to be,

486
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:40,940
we're going to start referring to that logarithmic function in 2D

487
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:44,940
or one of our in 3D as the Green's function for Laplace's equation.

488
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:49,940
For most of this, we're just going to be doing Laplace's equation.

489
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:53,940
If there's some time, well, with six lectures,

490
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,940
it probably won't do much other than Laplace's equation.

491
00:27:55,940 --> 00:28:00,940
But for this, just so we don't have to keep writing down 2 in 3D

492
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,940
or the square root of the sum of the squares,

493
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,940
we'll write it down as a Green's function.

494
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,940
Now, what we can do is to say,

495
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:10,940
well, if I put enough point charges down,

496
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:13,940
I can write down a system of equations.

497
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:16,940
I have these points, so I take my domain.

498
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:19,940
I sprinkle point charges in there, a bunch of them.

499
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,940
And then I'm going to pick the magnitude of these point charges

500
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:25,940
to match the boundary conditions.

501
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:31,940
So where should I match the boundary conditions?

502
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,940
How many boundary conditions can I match?

503
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,940
If I put 100 points inside that square,

504
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:42,940
how many points on the surface of the square can I match?

505
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:45,940
Well, I have 100 degrees of freedom.

506
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,940
Is the system of equations I'm going to get?

507
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,940
Exactly how do I set that up?

508
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:54,940
Well, so let's imagine that we have some Green test points

509
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:57,940
on the surface of the square.

510
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:00,940
So we're going to write down something that takes us

511
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:06,940
from these point source weights.

512
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:17,940
Well, that's going to be alpha 1 to alpha n.

513
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:21,940
We have this matrix that's going to be number of point sources.

514
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:46,940
And we're going to set that equal to, if we have a Dirichlet problem,

515
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,940
we're going to have a set of potentials at these test points.

516
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:52,940
And then we have to decide how many test points we want to have.

517
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:53,940
So we're going to have a set of potentials at these test points.

518
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,940
And then we're going to have a set of potentials at these test points.

519
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:56,940
And then we're going to have a set of potentials at these test points.

520
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,940
Well, if we have n weights, how many test points should we have?

521
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:01,940
So we say, well, n.

522
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,940
Why n?

523
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:07,940
Why as many test points as I have weights?

524
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:12,940
What will be true about the system of equations?

525
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:15,940
It will be square.

526
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:19,940
Provided, so we ought to be able to invert this.

527
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,940
If we had more test points than we had weights, or base,

528
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:24,940
point sources, we'd get a least square solution.

529
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:29,940
We could do that too.

530
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:30,940
In MATLAB, you can't even tell.

531
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,940
You just use the slash command.

532
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,940
It takes care of it for you.

533
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:37,940
But from your programming, it doesn't really care whether you have more test points

534
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:40,940
or fewer test points than you have weights.

535
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,940
So there are lots of different methods for doing this.

536
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:45,940
But for the moment, we're just going to think that we have as many weights

537
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:48,940
as we have test points, but this is not fundamental.

538
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:49,940
And what goes inside of here is this matrix.

539
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:55,940
What goes inside of here is this int function that goes from point source location,

540
00:30:55,940 --> 00:31:12,940
x i, to test point location, x j.

541
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:16,940
Which is which?

542
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:17,940
Which is the test point?

543
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,940
Which is the source point?

544
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,940
Which is the test point?

545
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:26,940
For grid functions in Laplace's equation, does it matter?

546
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:30,940
So Laplace's equation, we always have the idea that it's symmetric.

547
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:34,940
That is, if I have the point source in my right hand and my test point in my left hand,

548
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:37,940
the interaction is the same as if the point charge is in my left hand

549
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,940
and my test point is in my right hand.

550
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:44,940
When we're distance, distance doesn't care which way you're going.

551
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:48,940
The distance along the road doesn't matter where you start.

552
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:49,940
Okay.

553
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:53,940
So, how well is this going to work?

554
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,940
And what things have we figured out yet?

555
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:05,940
So we have n point sources, n test points, and then we can set up a system of equations.

556
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:10,940
And once we get the weights, can we get the potential everywhere outside?

557
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:14,940
Can I, once I've done that, can I only get the potential at the test points,

558
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:18,940
or can I evaluate it anywhere outside?

559
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,940
Anywhere.

560
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,940
You can evaluate it anywhere.

561
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:29,940
I just pick a point x, and I sum up n contributions from these n source points

562
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,940
with the distance to this test point.

563
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:39,940
So I now have actually a representation as a weighted combination of source point potentials.

564
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:43,940
That weighted combination of source point potentials tells me the potential everywhere.

565
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:47,940
What if I wanted the normal derivative, or the derivative in any direction?

566
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:51,940
What would I do with those point sources?

567
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:56,940
So they produce potentials that go like 1 over r in 3D, or like log r in 2D.

568
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:01,940
If I want to know what the normal derivative of the potential is at any point in the exterior,

569
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,940
can I do that?

570
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:10,940
I just differentiate the Green's function once.

571
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:14,940
And now I have a weighted combination of differentiated Green's functions

572
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,940
that I can use to calculate the normal derivative that I've got.

573
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:21,940
So I have an ice cube I throw in the ocean.

574
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:24,940
I represent the ice cube with point sources.

575
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,940
I calculate what those point sources are.

576
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,940
And then I have a representation of potential everywhere outside

577
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:33,940
that I can differentiate and actually figure out the heat leaving the ice cube.

578
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:37,940
This is not whatever half the freshman who comes in at MIT did.

579
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:41,940
They have other approximations to this,

580
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:46,940
including throwing an ice cube in a bucket of water and timing that thing.

581
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:54,940
OK, so we still don't know two things.

582
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:59,940
What two things don't we know?

583
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:06,940
So I said put test points on the surface and put source points in the interior

584
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:09,940
and just set the weights for the source points in the interior

585
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:14,940
so that they produce a potential that matches the given potential test points.

586
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,940
But I didn't say what.

587
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:21,940
Where should I put the test points?

588
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:24,940
Where? Where should I put them?

589
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:28,940
Spread them around.

590
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:31,940
What should I do with the source points?

591
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:35,940
Should I cluster them in the center?

592
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,940
Should I move them to the edge?

593
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:44,940
What happens to the potential to one of those sources when you get too close to it?

594
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,940
What does it do?

595
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:48,940
Divergence.

596
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,940
Divergence in a particular way.

597
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:51,940
What does it do?

598
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:54,940
If I get too close to a point source, what happens?

599
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:57,940
The potential goes to, the field goes to?

600
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,940
Infinity.

601
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,940
Infinity?

602
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:04,940
So that may be what you meant by divergence.

603
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,940
So it goes to infinity.

604
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:10,940
Numerically, that might not be such a good thing.

605
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:14,940
If some of your matrix elements are really close to infinity and others are like one,

606
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,940
it's not so good.

607
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:19,940
So we have this problem now.

608
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:23,940
Where should we put the sources?

609
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,940
We could put them near the edge.

610
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:32,940
The problem with putting near the edge, then every test point will have a point source that it is affected by most strongly.

611
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:38,940
So their distance to the part will be very small and that entry in the diagonal matrix will be near infinity.

612
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,940
And all the other points won't matter very much.

613
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,940
So you might get large errors if you do that.

614
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:52,940
So that might say don't put the points too close to the edge because then the interactions get too large.

615
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,940
What if I cluster them all in the center?

616
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,940
Could anything go wrong there?

617
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:57,940
Not enough leverage.

618
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:58,940
Say again?

619
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:01,940
Not enough leverage over any given .

620
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:07,940
So you're right, but I'm going to make you be a little more precise about what you mean by leverage.

621
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:13,940
So if I pull off one of those points and say how does it affect all my test points?

622
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,940
And then I pull off the points source.

623
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:20,940
I'm going to put the points source right next to it and see how it affects all my test points.

624
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:28,940
Those two points sources when I cluster them in the center are going to have almost identical effects on the test point.

625
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:35,940
What will that mean about the system of equations we generate to solve for the test point waves?

626
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:44,940
So I'll have one row or one column or other corresponding to one test point and another column corresponding to a test point right next to it.

627
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,940
Those columns will be almost equal to each other.

628
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:52,940
What does that mean about the system of equations when the columns are almost identical?

629
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:55,940
Yeah?

630
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:58,940
They're very close to not being linearly independent.

631
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:06,940
Not being linearly independent which means the matrix is ill-conditioned or possibly even close to singular.

632
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:11,940
If it's ill-conditioned, then that too will cause you problems.

633
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,940
It means that you will get...

634
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:22,940
If it's ill-conditioned, you may have test point values that are ones and twos and you may get these weights being 10 million or 100 million.

635
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:26,940
So you have one weight is 100 million and the other one next to it will be minus 100 million.

636
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,940
And then you'll get weird errors because of that.

637
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:34,940
So these methods, they have all these different names.

638
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,940
They're called De-singularized methods.

639
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,940
They have all the...

640
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:39,940
I forgot what they say.

641
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,940
A whole bunch of different names for it.

642
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,940
The problems with these two placements are...

643
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:57,940
If it's close to the boundary, then what happens is at the test point you get finite values and then in between the test points the two point sources don't exactly cancel out.

644
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:00,940
And you get these things going to infinity.

645
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:03,940
And if you cluster them in the center, the matrix becomes singular.

646
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,940
Both of them produce problems.

647
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,940
So I wanted to show you...

648
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,940
But that doesn't mean you can't use these methods.

649
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:12,940
And in fact, there have been renewed interest in these methods.

650
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:18,940
Because there are some new algorithms for figuring out how to place these points in good positions.

651
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:24,940
But I just wanted to show you a computational result just so you have an idea in mind of the way the errors form in these methods.

652
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:28,940
So the neat thing about them is this.

653
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:35,940
No matter what you do, wherever you put the point sources, wherever you put the test points, however your condition matrix is,

654
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,940
the solution you get...

655
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,940
Does it always satisfy Laplace's equation?

656
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:50,940
And so you're constructing a solution that always, always, always, always satisfies the Laplace's equation.

657
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:55,940
So very different from finite element methods, finite difference methods.

658
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:58,940
Where those solutions don't always satisfy the PE.

659
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:01,940
These always satisfy the PE.

660
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,940
What they do is satisfy the boundary conditions.

661
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:11,940
So if you do these kinds of methods, you definitely satisfy the boundary conditions at certain test points and not in between.

662
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:16,940
So yes, you produce a solution that satisfies the PE.

663
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,940
But if you don't match the boundary conditions, they can be quite off.

664
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,940
And when you're looking at these things that look like crowns,

665
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:27,940
there are plots of the potential on this circle in between the test points.

666
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:31,940
So you can see at the test points, the potentials are exactly one.

667
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:34,940
So we set the potential of the circle to be exactly one.

668
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:40,940
And then we put these source points, the ones in red, just inside.

669
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,940
And then set up the system of equations.

670
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:45,940
And calculate it with n equals 20 and n equals 40 points.

671
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:52,940
It's a little hard to see from here, but the error for n equals 40 is about, is a good factor of,

672
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:59,940
let's see, it's about a factor of five down from n equals 20 or roughly a factor of four, actually.

673
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:04,940
But in addition, you see that the worst case errors are in between the test points.

674
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:09,940
So right at the test points, it gets exactly the right potential for the surface.

675
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,940
And in between the test points, it's not matching the boundary conditions.

676
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:19,940
So, and then you go outside and then, well, what do you know about the errors in Laplace's equations?

677
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:23,940
Where, do you know the, how many of you know the maximum modulus principle?

678
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:28,940
All right, so here's the thing to know about Laplace's equation.

679
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:33,940
The Laplace's equation, if you have something that satisfies Laplace's equation,

680
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:38,940
and you have two solutions to Laplace's equation, and it's over a domain,

681
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:41,940
and you know where the surface of the domain is, where's the worst case error?

682
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:48,940
Well, it's an interior and exterior problem.

683
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:51,940
Worst case error is always on the surface.

684
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:55,940
So the difference between the two of them will never get worse than it is at the surface.

685
00:40:55,940 --> 00:41:01,940
So because of that, if you know you, if you know what the errors are on the surface of this exterior domain,

686
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:02,940
the errors always go down.

687
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:06,940
The difference between the exact solution and one you might numerically compute,

688
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:10,940
as long as they're both solutions to Laplace's equations, the maximum error is at the boundary.

689
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:13,940
This is the great thing about Laplace's equation.

690
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:17,940
It means that when you do these integral equation methods that look at surfaces,

691
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:20,940
you only have to look at the errors on the surfaces.

692
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:25,940
All right, so, but that's kind of a thing we're going to change,

693
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:29,940
and one of the things we'll come back to and look at a lot.

694
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:33,940
But we can get a lot of intuition from those kind of point source methods.

695
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:38,940
But what we really do is smear the point sources into a density.

696
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:41,940
So imagine you have these point sources, and you put them in a crucible,

697
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:46,940
and you smash them up, and you turn them into kind of a smear,

698
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,940
which you put on the surface.

699
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:52,940
So now you have this kind of charge density smear on your surface.

700
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:56,940
And since it's not a point charge anymore, the closer you get to the surface,

701
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,940
the less actual charge there is.

702
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:00,940
So there's a finite charge density.

703
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:05,940
So if you're, unlike a point charge, which has an infinite charge density right where the point source is,

704
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,940
this smear has a finite charge density.

705
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:08,940
So you can get a point charge density.

706
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,940
So it doesn't produce these infinities,

707
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:15,940
but it replaces writing down these sums of point source potentials with an integral.

708
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:18,940
So now you may all recognize the superposition integral,

709
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:22,940
but if you have charge on the surface, and you want to know what the potential is everywhere,

710
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:26,940
you integrate that charge on the surface over the surface of your domain,

711
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:29,940
and that gives you the potential everywhere outside.

712
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:32,940
So now we're going to try to estimate the charge density.

713
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:36,940
And that's the next step in this thing, which is,

714
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:37,940
okay, so if we're talking about a point charge density,

715
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:46,940
we're going to write down a system of equations where we have this charge density on the surface,

716
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:50,940
it produces a potential, and now we want to know what that charge density is.

717
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:53,940
We know what the Green's function is, we want to figure out what this charge density is.

718
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:56,940
So that's a continuum charge density.

719
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:01,940
But with a continuum charge density, when we come up with the numerical methods for computing it,

720
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,940
what's the first thing we do?

721
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,940
So in this class, what have you done?

722
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:14,940
You come up with some representation for that continuous density in terms of

723
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:19,940
piecewise polynomials, finite elements,

724
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:25,940
you call these things a, let's just turn on basis.

725
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:29,940
So we're going to come up with, so what's a good basis for this?

726
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:33,940
How should we represent this continuous charge density on the surface?

727
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:35,940
So we had point charges, and that was easy.

728
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:36,940
We could just sum up the potentials together.

729
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:38,940
We could just sum up the potentials due to point charges.

730
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:41,940
We could get this matrix, we could write it down.

731
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:44,940
So now we're saying, okay, well, we don't want to use point charges

732
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:47,940
because the potential due to point charges go to infinity.

733
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:50,940
We're going to use charge density because you get close to charge density

734
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:53,940
and it doesn't go to infinity.

735
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:57,940
And now we have to figure out, okay, if we're putting a density,

736
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:01,940
it's like we're coating the surface with cream cheese or butter.

737
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,940
I don't think charge density is alike.

738
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:04,940
It's actually more like molasses.

739
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:05,940
It's a different thing.

740
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:08,940
It's a different joke.

741
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:10,940
Charge density is like molasses.

742
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:13,940
I just don't want you going out there and thinking,

743
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:20,940
well, this electrical engineering professor said that charge is like molasses.

744
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:27,940
Okay, so what's a good representation for the charge density?

745
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:31,940
What should we use?

746
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:34,940
So if we're talking about 2D, what's the surface of a domain in 2D?

747
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:35,940
What's the surface of a domain in 2D?

748
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:38,940
It's just a line drawn on a piece of paper.

749
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:40,940
It's this curve.

750
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:42,940
So we're talking about this line charge.

751
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:48,940
How should we represent this line charge that's going to be distributed now?

752
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:55,940
Well, you could use straight piecewise constant charge densities.

753
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:57,940
So these are piecewise constant line charges.

754
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:00,940
This is going to be our basis function.

755
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:04,940
And this is one of those subtle points.

756
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:08,940
So you're going to use striping and plotting,

757
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:10,940
and that's going to give you the position you usually want.

758
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:11,940
And it's a non-tumor room.

759
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:12,940
If you have too much space on the dunnoism side here,

760
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:31,480
you might consider 궁

761
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:34,940
What will I do in this space?

762
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:37,220
I mean, golf's not such a good one anymore.

763
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:39,220
It used to work 30 years ago, right?

764
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,460
The golf balls have these sort of facets on them.

765
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:44,560
But you think of it as like a polygon.

766
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:49,020
So we're making a geometric approximation

767
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:52,060
along with assuming that the charge density

768
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:53,620
is constant along this line.

769
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:55,620
So we're going to say on each of these lines,

770
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:56,880
the charge density will be constant.

771
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,440
So you may be thinking, wait a second.

772
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,000
I started out with point charges,

773
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,180
and I get too close to the point charge,

774
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:04,880
and it goes to infinity.

775
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:07,480
What about a line charge?

776
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:10,100
Do you get too close to a line charge as it goes to infinity?

777
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:12,660
Turns out, no.

778
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,880
But you have to actually go through the calculation to see that.

779
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:19,200
In 3D, you use sheets of charge,

780
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,880
and sheets of charge of a finite charge density

781
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,540
don't go to infinity as you approach it.

782
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,900
But we're going to look at that a little more carefully,

783
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:28,680
but not most likely today.

784
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:32,620
And this kind of geometric approximation,

785
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:34,460
it's not like integral equations.

786
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:34,920
It's not like integral equations.

787
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:35,160
It's not like integral equations.

788
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:35,260
It's not like integral equations.

789
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:36,320
You've seen something like that.

790
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,540
You start representing spheres of triangles,

791
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,100
you have the same sort of thing, right?

792
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:41,660
The triangles that you use to find out,

793
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:43,840
you do 2T, you find elements of triangles,

794
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,360
you get the same sort of thing.

795
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,740
You are approximating a curved surface

796
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:50,400
with piecewise constant straight sections,

797
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,340
or you might use curve-based syllables.

798
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,400
And you can try to improve this,

799
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,320
but we're not going to worry so much about that.

800
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,380
And now what we're going to do is

801
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:02,300
we're going to write down our integral equation

802
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:04,560
as the Green's function is still the same,

803
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,540
because that just is about the PDE.

804
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:08,740
And we're going to use this weighted combination

805
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,940
of line charges, and we're going to use

806
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:13,500
that to calculate the potential.

807
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,920
And now we have this other question, which is,

808
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,520
so we took our domain, right?

809
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:19,600
We started out this way.

810
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,440
I apologize for reusing the board,

811
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,800
but I remember the cameras only pointing

812
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,000
at these and not the other two.

813
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,120
So we started out, here's our sphere,

814
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,700
and we maybe put point charges inside.

815
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:51,680
And we had test points on the sphere.

816
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:54,700
And now we're going to replace that

817
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,780
with these piecewise constant straight sections.

818
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,600
It's supposed to be like a sphere.

819
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:07,960
So we're going to put a sigma one,

820
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:11,020
a sigma two, a sigma three, et cetera.

821
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:18,020
Those are the replacements for my point charges for my sphere,

822
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,080
which you can see clearly goes through these points.

823
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:24,640
Where do I put the test points?

824
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,160
So I now have, well, how many unknowns do I have?

825
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,260
I break it up into n lines.

826
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,120
And piecewise constant lines.

827
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,320
One, two, three, four, five, six, n.

828
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:44,320
How many test points do I need to get a square system?

829
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:46,940
I need n test points.

830
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:47,840
Where should I put them?

831
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:55,880
Should I put them at the ends or in the middle?

832
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,060
Should I put them here?

833
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:03,700
Or at the ends?

834
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:07,660
The x's or the o's?

835
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:10,320
How many say x's?

836
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:13,060
How many say o's?

837
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:19,060
Oh, well, this is how you get Trump the president.

838
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:25,620
Well, so x's seem like a good idea.

839
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:26,880
They're in the middle of the lines.

840
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,620
But what about the n points?

841
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:31,360
They seem a little extreme.

842
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:34,060
I'm like, oh, political, I'm sorry.

843
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,560
I'm going to have to be recorded, too.

844
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,280
I'll have to bleep it.

845
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:44,600
So why the midpoints and not the endpoints?

846
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:45,780
Well, there are a couple reasons.

847
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:47,860
Something is, of course, that the endpoints now

848
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:50,840
have this sort of sudden inflection.

849
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:54,520
But the endpoints are actually on the sphere.

850
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,960
So it might seem like that's a good idea.

851
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:02,760
What about in 3D, where I break the surface up into triangles?

852
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,040
Can I use endpoints then in 3D?

853
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:04,480
Yeah.

854
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:04,560
Yeah.

855
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:05,060
Yeah.

856
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:05,560
Yeah.

857
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,560
Will there be as many endpoints as there

858
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:10,020
are centroids in the triangle?

859
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:14,800
I imagine taking a sphere and turning it into polygons,

860
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,000
the things with triangulations.

861
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:22,160
Will you have the right number of points and unknowns?

862
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,700
Well, you will if you put the point

863
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:24,960
in the center of the triangle.

864
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,660
Because then you've got one point for a triangle.

865
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:29,620
You put it on the vertices, eh, not so clear.

866
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:31,240
So in 2D, you can do either one.

867
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,520
In 3D, center.

868
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,480
But it turns out there's some other advantages.

869
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,940
Just putting things in the center, which is that you get,

870
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:41,040
you usually get better accuracy because it's a midpoint rule.

871
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,900
It tends to cancel out linear variations.

872
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:49,060
But again, for the moment, not the important part for us.

873
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:50,660
So this is the idea.

874
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:53,880
We're going to try to take our original problem, which

875
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,100
has a charge density on the surface.

876
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:58,480
We're going to try to calculate that charge density

877
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:02,240
by making sure it produces potentials that match

878
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,400
the given potentials on the surface.

879
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,040
So we generate these piecewise constant representations

880
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:09,200
of the charge.

881
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,000
And we'll just integrate them.

882
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,720
And what we have to do is calculate these line integrals.

883
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:14,960
And it's sort of a pain in the neck,

884
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,140
but it's not that hard to do.

885
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:18,160
But one can.

886
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,800
And you set up a system of equations.

887
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:21,760
So this is the idea.

888
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,420
Now you have a 2D method.

889
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:27,040
You pick a set of points on your surface in 2D.

890
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:27,960
You take this curve.

891
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,940
You connect the points with lines.

892
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:31,560
Those define your line chart.

893
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,540
Then you calculate the weights of the line chart

894
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:33,900
and the points.

895
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:35,740
So you can do this with the test points.

896
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:37,700
And then you just have to evaluate the line chargers

897
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:39,720
by making sure it produces the correct potential

898
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:41,260
at all of the test points.

899
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:43,780
And you just have to evaluate this Green's function,

900
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:47,700
which is the integral over a line charge of the potential

901
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,040
of these test points.

902
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,360
And then once you have those weights,

903
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,400
what can you do with them?

904
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,960
Now I have this weighted combination of line chargers.

905
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:58,620
What can I do with that?

906
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:01,540
Can I evaluate the potential outside?

907
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:03,040
Yeah, I can use the weighted combination

908
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:08,440
outside. Can I evaluate the derivative of the potential outside? Sure, I now have an

909
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:12,580
analytic function for the potential everywhere outside. I can differentiate it,

910
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:20,380
calculate flows, anything I want. So it's a numerical procedure that only counts

911
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:25,240
on us being able to calculate the integrals of 1 over r over lines, which

912
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:29,440
seems like a relatively simple problem. Turns out it has some subtleties to it.

913
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:32,800
I'll talk a little bit about this towards the end, and we'll talk about more

914
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:41,380
tomorrow. Excuse me, Wednesday. Alright, so now I have this question. Is that the

915
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:46,420
right thing to do? Should we make sure that we pick the weights on the

916
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:53,620
line charges so that they give exactly the right potential at test points? That

917
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:57,520
seems like we're just sampling at test points.

918
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:59,440
We could also do this.

919
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:04,420
We could also do something else. What do we do in finite element methods? What do we try to do?

920
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:09,340
How do we pick the weights of the finite elements? Plug it into the weak form of

921
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:13,360
the integral and make sure the residual is what?

922
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:22,820
Alright, so Professor Wang's out of the room. One thing to remember about finite elements.

923
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:29,280
It's the most important thing. That idea. The really great thing is

924
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:34,040
for these finite element basis functions, you plug them into the integral operator,

925
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:42,120
into the weak form, and you calculate the weights so that the potential

926
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:45,840
produces is orthogonal to that basis set. And we refer to that sometimes as the

927
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:51,840
Galerka method. Very powerful idea. There's also a representation in a certain space

928
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:59,100
of the PD. We can do the same thing for integral equations. The difference is the

929
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:03,500
theory for partial differential equations. It's probably one of the few places where

930
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:08,860
this is true. The theory for partial differential equations is much easier to get at than the

931
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:12,220
theory for integral equations because you have this projection on the surface and you

932
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:15,460
get these what are called fractional sublux spaces. So we're not going to do very much

933
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:21,800
of that. But there is something amazing about this when you do this.

934
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:28,920
So we have two problems. And I'm going to say what this is in a moment. So we have these two ideas.

935
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:36,100
We could pick the line charge weights so that we get exactly the right potential of a test point.

936
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:41,100
Or we could make them orthogonal to our basis. We could make the errors orthogonal to our basis.

937
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:48,100
If our basis are lines, then we're basically saying the average potential on the line is right.

938
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:56,100
So it can be off everywhere, but on average it's right. And that's usually called the Galerka method.

939
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:59,100
And then you can come up with all sorts of variance where you come up with a test point.

940
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:05,100
You can come up with test bases and representation bases and you mix them up in some ways.

941
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:08,100
And for certain kinds of intervals, it's really important to do that.

942
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:16,100
For the Laplace's equation, it's usually easiest just to think about the Galerka method where they're both the same.

943
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:24,100
So if we do this, we do collocation where we have test points and the weights on the basis function,

944
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:29,100
we get this matrix that relates the test point potential to the test point.

945
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:32,100
And then we do the same thing with the other two methods.

946
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:37,100
So we have the two methods that relate the test point potential to the weights on the lines.

947
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:41,100
And there's something sort of weird when we think about these two methods.

948
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:48,100
So we got one that says I calculate the potential to this line charge and then either integrate it over this other line charge

949
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:51,100
or I just test it to the center of this other line charge.

950
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:54,100
So I have kind of two things going on.

951
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:58,100
I'm going to write a picture of that so you can keep it in mind.

952
00:55:58,100 --> 00:56:01,100
And we're saying here are our test points in the middle.

953
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:05,100
And we're saying this line charge goes to this test point.

954
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:10,100
Sorry, I want something more compelling.

955
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:12,100
Suppose my line charge is like this.

956
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:17,100
And like that.

957
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:21,100
So I have this line charge and it goes to this test point.

958
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:25,100
And I also have this second line charge.

959
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:27,100
It goes to this test point.

960
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:30,100
Going to this test point.

961
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:39,100
Or I take the same thing, I think.

962
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:49,100
And I have the line charge, the big line charge, goes to the entire little line charge.

963
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:55,100
And the little line charge goes to predict potentials across the big line charge.

964
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:57,100
And one of these is this.

965
00:56:57,100 --> 00:57:04,100
As the x is, this is collocation.

966
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:10,100
And the other one is galergic.

967
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:15,100
Looking at those two methods, can you tell me something about the matrices they'll produce?

968
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:21,100
So one is calculate the weights of the line charges based on making sure you match the test point potentials.

969
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:26,100
The other one is calculate the, so that was this collocation idea.

970
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:37,100
And the other one is calculate the line charge by calculating potential producers over the other line and integrating.

971
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:47,100
So the problem with collocation is that I have one big line over here and a short one here.

972
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:51,100
One big line which is my right arm and the short one which is the yellow trough.

973
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:56,100
Is the interaction, is this right arm line charge.

974
00:57:56,100 --> 00:58:01,100
And its potential, the potential produces this test point in the middle of the yellow trough.

975
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:08,100
Is that the same as the yellow trough's line charge and its influence on the potential in the center of my arm?

976
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:11,100
Are those two interactions the same?

977
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:14,100
Right line charge really big.

978
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:17,100
Test point potential on this little trough.

979
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:23,100
Little trough and its influence on the test point potential in my much larger right arm.

980
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:25,100
Are those two interactions going to be identical?

981
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:30,100
No.

982
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:36,100
But the Green's function has a symmetry but the discretization doesn't seem to capture that.

983
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:40,100
So there's something funny about this collocation method.

984
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:47,100
What's going to be true about the matrix that you generate to calculate these weights then for collocation using test point potentials?

985
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:50,100
What property will it not have?

986
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:53,100
It will not be, it ends with an S.

987
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:55,100
It ends with metric.

988
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:59,100
It's not going to be symmetric.

989
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:03,100
But the Green's function is symmetric so that seems sort of odd.

990
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:14,100
But if we use, if we instead, instead of using the, instead we do a Galerkin method.

991
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:24,100
When we say now we're going to take the potential due to line charge and test it by taking its integral over the other line.

992
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:31,100
So now I'm taking the potential due to my right arm and integrating it over the yellow trough.

993
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:36,100
And taking the potential due to the yellow trough and integrating it over my right arm.

994
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:39,100
Both interactions are going to be identical.

995
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:42,100
You can just see it from the integration.

996
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:47,100
So the Galerkin method for these problems because the kernel or the Green's function is symmetric.

997
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:50,100
The Galerkin method has preserved that symmetry.

998
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:52,100
So there's something very appealing about that.

999
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:53,100
In fact it's.

1000
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:55,100
The way in which you make energy arguments.

1001
00:59:55,100 --> 01:00:01,100
Just as you do for Van-Nolen methods when you have what we refer to as self adjoint operators.

1002
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:03,100
Okay so.

1003
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:09,100
The, nevertheless so it's, you know, it seems clear that it's better to use Galerkin methods.

1004
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:12,100
And so we should all use Galerkin methods.

1005
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:17,100
Except of course that means you have to do this extra integration which, you know, when you're writing the code you say.

1006
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:22,100
Oh yeah I'll do a single point in the center of the line as kind of a simple quadrature scheme.

1007
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:24,100
And I'll get around to doing the rest of them later.

1008
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:27,100
And, you know, later never comes.

1009
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:30,100
So people use collocation all the time but Galerkin's better.

1010
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:31,100
Yep.

1011
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:34,100
Can you repeat the difference between collocation and Galerkin please?

1012
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:41,100
So collocation was the one where I have the line charge and I calculate the weights on the line charge.

1013
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:45,100
By making sure it matches test points in the center of the lines.

1014
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:47,100
That was collocation.

1015
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:50,100
And Galerkin was I calculate the line charge weights based on making sure that it matches the test points.

1016
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:51,100
Okay.

1017
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:55,100
Based on making sure that it is potential, correct potential averaged over the line.

1018
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:58,100
Alright.

1019
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:02,100
So we have now a whole collection of different things.

1020
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:07,100
Regardless of which one you use.

1021
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:09,100
Alright.

1022
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:10,100
So what do the residuals look like?

1023
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:12,100
So here's a quick picture if you want to.

1024
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:16,100
So here's an answer to your question that's a better thing which is a picture.

1025
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:17,100
Alright.

1026
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:19,100
So for Galerkin.

1027
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:21,100
They.

1028
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:25,100
The test functions and the basis functions are.

1029
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:28,100
The basis functions of collocation and Galerkin are the same.

1030
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:29,100
They're representing the source.

1031
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:33,100
But in collocation the test functions are like impulses.

1032
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:37,100
And in Galerkin they're averages over line charges.

1033
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:43,100
So is that maybe a better picture for what the difference between the two is?

1034
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:46,100
But regardless of which one.

1035
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:48,100
Well now you can also think about what the errors look like.

1036
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:51,100
So in the residual for.

1037
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:54,100
The collocation methods the residuals go to zero.

1038
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:56,100
At the test points for a collocation method.

1039
01:01:56,100 --> 01:02:01,100
So you have this nice thing where you get exactly the right.

1040
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:03,100
Boundary condition at.

1041
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:04,100
A set of test points.

1042
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:08,100
That doesn't mean you get the right answer anywhere except those test points.

1043
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:10,100
But in the Galerkin method.

1044
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:12,100
Your residual.

1045
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:14,100
Your errors in the boundary.

1046
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:18,100
Are sort of averaged over each of these lines.

1047
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:20,100
So one is it's exactly right at certain points.

1048
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:22,100
The other one is.

1049
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:24,100
Never right.

1050
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:28,100
So.

1051
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:30,100
Does that mean.

1052
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:32,100
What does that mean for the potential outside?

1053
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:33,100
Remember.

1054
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:36,100
Both of these things produce solutions.

1055
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:39,100
That satisfy Laplace's equation everywhere outside.

1056
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:41,100
Doesn't matter what the weights are.

1057
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:43,100
You still satisfy Laplace's equation.

1058
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:47,100
So these methods are just telling you about errors at the boundary.

1059
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:49,100
It's how poorly you satisfy the boundary condition.

1060
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:53,100
And then that gives you an idea about how big your errors are.

1061
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:55,100
So.

1062
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:57,100
The.

1063
01:02:57,100 --> 01:02:59,100
So I don't want to start that.

1064
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:00,100
I want to.

1065
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:02,100
I want to say one more point about this because it's more important than that.

1066
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:05,100
I'll say a little bit about 3D problems.

1067
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:06,100
So I'll come back to this virus.

1068
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:09,100
We'll make sure I've made this point.

1069
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:10,100
These matrices.

1070
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:13,100
What's true about these matrices?

1071
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:17,100
Does every line charge affect every test point?

1072
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:37,100
So if I write down this a matrix that goes from from alphas one to alpha n and gives me test point potentials.

1073
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:39,100
Is this what's true about this matrix?

1074
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:43,100
Does every line charge contribute contribute a template or test point?

1075
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:45,100
So what's true about this matrix?

1076
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:46,100
It's not the sparks.

1077
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:47,100
It's not sparks.

1078
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:48,100
It's.

1079
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:50,100
More than that.

1080
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:52,100
Sparks is dense, but galerkin method.

1081
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:55,100
What about galerkin?

1082
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:56,100
Is a better.

1083
01:03:56,100 --> 01:04:04,100
Does it generate a sparse matrix?

1084
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:13,100
Does every line charge contribute to the average of the potential every, every, every test line?

1085
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:14,100
It does.

1086
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:17,100
So what does that mean about the galerkin matrix?

1087
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:18,100
It's not sparse.

1088
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:19,100
Sparse or dense?

1089
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:20,100
Sparse.

1090
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:21,100
Dense.

1091
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:22,100
Dense.

1092
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:32,220
So how many of you remember offhand if I'm doing a 2D Laplace equation with a finite

1093
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:38,460
difference matrix with n unknowns, n points in a grid?

1094
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:41,340
How does the, and I solve it with sparse gas elimination.

1095
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:43,340
Did you do this one?

1096
01:04:43,340 --> 01:04:46,840
Do you know how long it takes to solve?

1097
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:55,120
So if I have n degrees of freedom in an integral equation method, what does it take to solve

1098
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:56,120
the system?

1099
01:04:56,120 --> 01:05:02,520
And just do Gaussian elimination, it's going to take n cubed operations.

1100
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:07,840
If the matrix is a typical sparse finite difference matrix in 2D, anybody know what it is for

1101
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:08,840
sparse matrix factorization?

1102
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:09,840
Yep.

1103
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:10,840
N.

1104
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:11,840
N.

1105
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:12,840
Not quite n.

1106
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:14,660
It's the needier to solve for its n.

1107
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:16,660
It's n to the 3 halves.

1108
01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:17,480
Right?

1109
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:20,780
And there's a, there are a number of different ways of thinking about that, but usually you

1110
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:21,780
use iterative methods.

1111
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:22,780
Just did not agree.

1112
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:23,780
I lost two levels.

1113
01:05:23,780 --> 01:05:24,780
You did not.

1114
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:25,780
All right.

1115
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:30,320
So then you could, so you have an order n-way of toying.

1116
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:35,080
So here's one thing that is interesting though about these dense matrices.

1117
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:42,940
What do you think happens to the condition number of those matrices as you refine the

1118
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:43,940
discretization?

1119
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:44,940
Versus what...

1120
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:48,440
So what happens to a finite difference matrix when you refine the discretization?

1121
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:50,440
If you make it finer and finer and finer?

1122
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:52,440
What happens to the condition number?

1123
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:59,440
How many iterations do you need to get, say, a conjugate gradient algorithm to convert before you do multigrid?

1124
01:06:01,940 --> 01:06:04,940
It goes up and up and up, which is why you have to do multigrid.

1125
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:08,940
These matrices, we'll see.

1126
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:11,440
Their condition number remains bounded.

1127
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:15,440
It's an amazing thing. It means you can use a Newton solver.

1128
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:17,440
So we'll come to that.

1129
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,440
I want to at least point to a few of these things.

1130
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:24,440
So I want to say one or two things about 3D problems, and I just want to show you pictures.

1131
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:31,440
So one of the very early uses of these kind of surface integral equations

1132
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:37,440
were to assess wave loads on ship hulls and tension-link platforms.

1133
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:41,440
Actually, it used to go to Newman, who was in our Ocean Engineering Department,

1134
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:45,440
who retired just a few years ago, was like the world's expert on doing these things.

1135
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:50,440
So now you have a ship hull, and now you're going to take the surface,

1136
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:52,440
and you're going to represent it with something.

1137
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:57,440
If it's 2D and you have a curve, you can connect it up with straight lines.

1138
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:00,440
In 3D, you have to connect it up with panels,

1139
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:04,440
and if you try to keep all the points on the panels in the same plane,

1140
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:09,440
you get what are sometimes called, and this is because the panels don't actually connect up to each other,

1141
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,440
there is the term called leaky panels.

1142
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:14,440
Because they used to use them for ship hulls.

1143
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:17,440
But they would have gaps between them.

1144
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:20,440
But if your surface is like a cube, you can just discretize the surface.

1145
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:23,440
So we can do a 3D problem, even though we're talking about mostly 2D.

1146
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:26,440
Then instead of lines, we have panels.

1147
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:30,440
We calculate the, we have the representation as point charges on panels.

1148
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:34,440
We calculate the potential by integrating over those panels.

1149
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:39,440
And we set up a system of equations where we put co-location points on the center,

1150
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:41,440
which are our panels.

1151
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:44,440
We have as our unknowns the charge density on each of the panels.

1152
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:48,440
And we solve for the charge density, and now we have a surface charge representation,

1153
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:51,440
which we can use to calculate the potential anywhere we want it.

1154
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:59,440
And one of the difficulties is that you have to calculate this integral over a panel of this 1 over r function,

1155
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:01,440
and evaluate it at test points.

1156
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:04,440
As long as the panel is here and the test point is here, that works fine.

1157
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:09,440
But if they get too close to each other, like if you want to calculate the potential on a particular panel,

1158
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:17,440
if they're close, if you're close by, you can sort of break it up into four panels and do it that way,

1159
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:21,440
and treat it as point charges, so you can do approximations.

1160
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:27,440
But the problem is, what happens when you have a panel and you have a point on the panel?

1161
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:29,440
Now here's the question.

1162
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:35,440
Is the integral over a panel of the source of the charge on the panel,

1163
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:38,440
does it produce a potential on the panel that's infinite?

1164
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:43,440
As I approach it, so here I am at my test point, and I'm coming close towards the panel,

1165
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:45,440
and I land on the panel.

1166
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:48,440
Now if I'm a bug, do I get zapped?

1167
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:51,440
Does it go to infinity?

1168
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:53,440
What do you think?

1169
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:58,440
Now it doesn't go to infinity, and a quick way to see that,

1170
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:02,440
you can just carve a disk out of the center of the panel and say,

1171
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:05,440
okay, well, I'll carve a disk out, and now I have a panel.

1172
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:07,440
Can I get a piece of paper I can borrow?

1173
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:08,440
No.

1174
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:13,440
So we're going to do this.

1175
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:17,440
I'm going to come back and put that in the corner.

1176
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:18,440
So we're going to do this.

1177
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:22,440
We're going to say, we're going to carve a circle out of the center of the panel,

1178
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:25,440
and we're going to say, so here's my panel now with a hole cut in it,

1179
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:27,440
and my test point is here.

1180
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:32,440
So the charge on the rest of the panel, it's not going to produce an infinity on this point,

1181
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:34,440
because it's far enough away.

1182
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:37,440
The problem is, what does this thing do?

1183
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:45,440
Well, but this thing is a disk, and now you can use a coordinate transformation

1184
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:51,440
and actually evaluate that integral analytically, and you discover it's finite.

1185
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:54,440
So for sure, this is kind of an interesting thing.

1186
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:57,440
You start out with point charges, which generate infinity,

1187
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:00,440
and now you have this thing where the potential, as you go towards the panel,

1188
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:05,440
it goes to some finite value and then goes back down again.

1189
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:06,440
All right.

1190
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:08,440
So you have this finite as you get to the panel.

1191
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:09,440
It also has to jump.

1192
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:10,440
Why is that?

1193
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:12,440
So I have a panel with, say, positive charge on it.

1194
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:15,440
I know the potential has to go up and then back down again.

1195
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:21,440
Why does the sign of the slope of the potential have to change signs?

1196
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:23,440
If I'm over here, which way is this field point?

1197
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:26,440
Which way is the field point on the other side?

1198
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:28,440
In the opposite direction.

1199
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:32,440
So you know it has to look something like this, because it's got to change slopes.

1200
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:35,440
So what if we differentiate that potential?

1201
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,440
Right at this panel?

1202
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:39,440
Well, then things are going to get a little weird.

1203
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:42,440
And we'll come back to a little bit about that later.

1204
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:43,440
All right.

1205
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:47,440
So how does one calculate this term?

1206
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:49,440
There are a whole lot of different methods,

1207
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:53,440
and we're going to talk a little bit about that next time.

1208
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:58,440
For this course, we have a code that calculates these integrals analytically.

1209
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:02,440
It's not that interesting a thing to do it analytically.

1210
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:03,440
It used to be.

1211
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:04,440
And as I said, it's not that interesting.

1212
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:09,440
And as I said, a fellow who recently retired would hate me if I said it's not that important,

1213
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:12,440
because he was like an expert in calculating these integrals

1214
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:16,440
using some very fancy theory in geometry through general panels.

1215
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:20,440
But we're going to have an analytic way of doing it,

1216
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:22,440
but we're also going to talk a little about numerical ways of doing it,

1217
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:25,440
because the ones you can do analytically are for flat panels,

1218
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:29,440
and the world is not, in fact, flat.

1219
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:32,440
Something we've known for actually quite a number of years.

1220
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:33,440
All right.

1221
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:35,440
So we wanted to summarize it.

1222
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:37,440
There's a lot of things.

1223
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:39,440
We went from starting with integral formulation,

1224
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:41,440
the exterior problem,

1225
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:43,440
starting with point sources,

1226
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:46,440
and noticing a really important set of things.

1227
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:49,440
One of them is dense matrices.

1228
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:53,440
So dense matrices, n cubed to factor,

1229
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:55,440
why would you ever use these methods?

1230
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:59,440
And from 1950 to 1990,

1231
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:02,440
that was the reason everybody used Pinot Noir methods,

1232
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:05,440
and then somewhere in the 90s,

1233
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:06,440
past methods were developed,

1234
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:08,440
and we'll talk about them, but not till the end of the term.

1235
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:10,440
So I'm going to ask you to suspend disbelief and say,

1236
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:13,440
well, okay, we're going to do integral equation methods,

1237
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:16,440
and then you'll tell us that we can actually solve interesting problems with them at the end.

1238
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:21,440
We'll find some order-ending ways of solving certain kinds of problems with these methods.

1239
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:25,440
And we talked about these standard collocation and Galerkin methods,

1240
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:28,440
and we talked a little bit about these problems in 3D.

1241
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:30,440
So next time we're going to talk about calculating these integrals,

1242
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:32,440
and we're going to come back and look at these things,

1243
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:34,440
these integral equations,

1244
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:38,440
and believe it or not, we're going to go all the way from starting with point sources

1245
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:40,440
to smearing things onto lines and panels,

1246
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:43,440
all the way back to turning things back into points.

1247
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:45,440
And that'll happen at the end of the next lecture.

1248
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:51,440
It's really good to take something you're learning and keep returning to it.

1249
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:55,440
But in fact, there are some really important ideas in how you solve integral equations

1250
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:57,440
that are called Nistre methods,

1251
01:12:57,440 --> 01:13:02,440
which sort of go back and forth with these ideas of points and panels and lines.

1252
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:07,440
And the reason we're going to do that next time is because when you face a problem,

1253
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:10,440
it's one of the things you're going to have to decide about.

1254
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:15,440
It's one of the degrees of freedom that's not sorted out for you in the literature.

1255
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:16,440
You're going to have to pick.

1256
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:21,440
Is this a formulation I can use, Nistre or point methods, or line methods, or panel methods?

1257
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:23,440
And is Galerkin important or not?

1258
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:27,440
Those are some of the things that if you develop a method for a particular problem you're trying to solve,

1259
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:32,440
you'll have to think through, and you'll have to decide which of these things will work for you and which won't.

1260
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:34,440
And some of them will and some of them won't.

1261
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:37,440
So next time we're actually going to go back over some of these things,

1262
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:39,440
but first we're going to talk about posture.

1263
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:43,440
We're going to talk about numerical methods for computing integral.

1264
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:45,440
And then just so I'm set up for that,

1265
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:48,440
and since there are more of you here now than there were before,

1266
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:50,440
we'll also try to do the poll online.

1267
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:53,440
For doing the problem sets, which will start next week,

1268
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,440
I'll have evening sessions for that.

1269
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:59,440
If you have constraints about both Monday and Wednesday evenings

1270
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:01,440
that you couldn't make either of those days,

1271
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:05,440
let me know, and if there are only one or two of you,

1272
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:08,440
I'll just arrange something, but if a lot of you do, then we'll switch days.

1273
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:13,440
Or if any of you want to, I'll offer a preference now about which days would be good.

1274
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:17,440
Anybody want to pick something other than Monday and Wednesday?

1275
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:22,440
Anybody have a different day? Tuesday or Thursday?

1276
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:28,440
Okay, so we'll probably start Monday and Wednesday, or maybe Wednesday of next week.

1277
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:31,440
We'll cover enough this week to do all of them.

1278
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:33,440
We'll go through the first of the problems.

1279
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:35,440
And we'll just have the problem set sessions,

1280
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:37,440
and I'm going to, again, encourage you to come,

1281
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:42,440
because these problem sets, this is not about evaluation.

1282
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:45,440
This comes very late in the term.

1283
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:48,440
It's much better that you get some experience trying to use these methods

1284
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:50,440
so you can decide if they're going to work for you for certain problems,

1285
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:53,440
because they're fantastic methods for certain kinds of problems,

1286
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:55,440
and useless in other ones.

1287
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:58,440
So having you get through the problem sets and figure out how to use them,

1288
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:00,440
it's a toolkit you keep around.

1289
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:02,440
So come to the problem sets.

1290
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:04,440
We expect everybody to get through them.

1291
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:06,440
They come so late in the term,

1292
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:10,440
we can't ask you to really have a mastery of all the aspects of it.

1293
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:12,440
So it's much better that you pick up the big picture

1294
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:15,440
and you ask questions for the things we've left out in the lecture

1295
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:17,440
so we can't possibly cover all the details.

1296
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:20,440
But we do want you to be able to actually do some computations with these methods

1297
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:22,440
so you get a sense of how they work.

1298
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:29,440
So, again, in the evenings, anybody has conflicts or issues about evening times,

1299
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:31,440
let me know and we'll find some other ones.

1300
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:34,440
But then we won't start that until probably Wednesday of next week,

1301
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:37,440
but I'll get the problem set up so you can see what it is this week,

1302
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:39,440
and we'll do an eStream next time.

1303
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:40,440
All right.

1304
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:45,440
Hopefully the video came out, the fun didn't die, and I'll post that too.

1305
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:47,440
All right. Thanks.

1306
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:57,440
Thanks very much for staying.

1307
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:58,440
You don't have to say for all of them.

1308
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:01,440
No, it's still there.
