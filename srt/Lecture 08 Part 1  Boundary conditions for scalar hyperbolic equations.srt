1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
And boundary condition in general is difficult.

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:09,360
So today let me illustrate some of the very basic ways to handle boundary conditions

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,800
for equations that exhibit wave-like behaviors.

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:16,260
Okay.

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,480
We're going to start talking about boundary conditions for scalar PDs.

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,800
And the simplest type of equation we want to look at.

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:33,280
And again, we are looking at the linear advecting equation.

8
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,100
Since we started talking about conservation laws,

9
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:45,780
this is simply an equation of a scalar conservation law with f of u, the flux, equal to what?

10
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,900
What is the flux in this equation?

11
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:52,900
If a conservation law, conservation...

12
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,100
Oops.

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:08,740
If a conservation law is written as partial u, partial t, plus partial f of u, partial x, equal to zero,

14
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,180
what is the flux in this case?

15
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:12,540
Yes?

16
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:14,960
Big u, lower u?

17
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,200
Big u times small u, right.

18
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,280
It's a linear function of u.

19
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:26,720
What is the characteristic speed of this equation?

20
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,400
Big u?

21
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,100
Hmm?

22
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:29,900
Big u?

23
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,840
It's just a big u.

24
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,280
Remember the characteristics?

25
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,780
They are df d small u, which in this case is equal to big u, exactly.

26
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:49,160
And if there are shocks, what is the speed of the shock?

27
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,860
Or speed of discontinuity?

28
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:17,180
The speed of discontinuity is equal to f on the left minus f on the right divided by u on the left minus u on the right.

29
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,600
Or it's delta f over delta u.

30
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:26,780
In this case, if f is a linear function of u, what is delta f over delta u?

31
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,300
Again, it's u, exactly.

32
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,320
So all the wave and all the discontinuity, everything propagates at the same speed u.

33
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,680
Now, in this case, what is the proper way of setting the boundary condition?

34
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,760
So let's consider two cases.

35
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:52,400
First case, u, big u, greater than zero.

36
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,780
And we no longer consider an infinite domain or p.

37
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,480
We consider a periodic domain.

38
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:00,240
We consider the domain between zero and l.

39
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,840
So this is x.

40
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,980
This is u.

41
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,340
Imagine I have an initial condition like that.

42
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,660
What is a proper way?

43
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,620
So let me first ask the hard question.

44
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:17,000
What is a proper way to specify the boundary condition at l?

45
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,980
At x equal to l.

46
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,980
Remember when big u is equal to zero, everything continues.

47
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:34,360
And the solution, discontinuous solution, the arc propagates towards the right with the positive speed.

48
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:39,280
So can I set a derivative boundary condition at x equal to l?

49
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,760
Let's say u equal to zero, can I do that?

50
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,520
No, I can't.

51
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:53,380
So what are the type of proper boundary conditions I can set on x equal to l?

52
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,140
Can I set a Newman boundary condition?

53
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:55,580
Can I set the derivative boundary condition?

54
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,320
Can I set the derivative boundary condition?

55
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:05,960
derivative of u at l equal to zero, for example, would it allow the waves to probably propagate

56
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:15,380
out of the domain, maintaining the shape? No. No boundary condition can be set at x equal to l.

57
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:24,480
So this is something I want to emphasize, is you should not set any boundary conditions.

58
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:35,440
So no boundary condition at x equal to l. Okay. At x equal to zero, on the other hand,

59
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,140
you can set Dirichlet boundary condition, you can set Newman boundary condition, you can do

60
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:49,320
a lot of things, you have a lot of flexibility at x equal to zero, right? So at x equal to zero,

61
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,560
you are free to choose

62
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,460
a

63
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:59,240
boundary condition. Your boundary condition, bc is boundary condition. All right. And the

64
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:07,480
second case, you should be able to use the same logic, is u less than zero, what is the

65
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:14,160
proper boundary condition at x equal to zero? In this case, the wave propagates towards

66
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:20,880
left, right? So what is the proper boundary condition for the, at the boundary where the

67
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,080
wave is coming out of the domain?

68
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:29,240
No boundary condition. No boundary condition, right. So there shouldn't be any boundary

69
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:35,740
condition if the waves are going out of the domain over here, because information goes

70
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:40,300
from inside the domain to outside the domain. There shouldn't be any information coming

71
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:48,360
from outside the domain. And the boundary condition is supplementary, it's basically

72
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,500
information coming from the boundary, from outside the boundary. That's what boundary

73
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,040
condition gives you.

74
00:05:54,480 --> 00:06:03,860
It gives you information from outside the boundary. So here, at x equal to L, we are

75
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:14,460
free to choose boundary condition. So these are a scalar conservation law, a scalar and

76
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:19,820
linear vector equation. So we can generalize, of course. I won't write it down here, but

77
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,380
like we can generalize. For a nonlinear PDE, if we have a characteristic of x equal to

78
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,280
zero, then we can generalize. We can generalize. For a nonlinear PDE, if we have a characteristic

79
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:33,600
that are not a constant U. How does the bounded condition work? It works the

80
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:39,640
similar way. It just depends on locally is the characteristics going towards

81
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:49,220
outside the domain or it is coming into the domain. Okay so in that case if you

82
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:56,380
code up a solver which you will do to solve a nonlinear scalar

83
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,800
conservation equation, I mean nonlinear scalar conservation law,

84
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:06,120
the proper boundary condition to set at the boundary may be time dependent.

85
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:12,680
So you have to adapt your bounded condition, actually adapt whether

86
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:19,200
you should set a boundary condition or not depending on the solution U at the

87
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:24,860
boundary. If the solution U at the boundary at that moment turns out to be

88
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:29,280
allowing the characteristics to go into the domain that is when you should set a

89
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,700
bounded condition. When the solution U is such that when you evaluate the F of that

90
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:39,000
U, you find the solution to be going, you find the characteristics to be going out

91
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,460
of the domain, then you know this is not the right time to set a bounded

92
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:48,260
condition. The bounded condition, what we mean by bounded condition is you're

93
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,180
setting the values

94
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:56,500
at a particular spatial location for a range of time. Here you need to, for

95
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,400
example, if you set a Dirichlet bounded condition, you need to set the

96
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:06,340
value of U at x equals 0 for a range of t. The bounded condition you should give

97
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:11,680
is a function of t only. For example you can set it with a constant 0 is a

98
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,620
perfectly fine function of t or you can set it to be linearly increasing as a

99
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,240
function of t either way. For example if you set a function of t as a function of t,

100
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,560
for example if you set this to be equal to 0, you would see the wave going towards the

101
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:29,800
right and whatever is left over, so you see the same shape adverting towards the

102
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:39,660
right and the range becomes 0 once the wave shifts away from x equal to 0. What

103
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:46,120
if you set this to be a function of t? What if you set it to be equal to just t,

104
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,300
for example?

105
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:52,980
The value increases as time increases and you're gonna see a wave that is not

106
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:56,420
0 but you're gonna see the same wave going towards the right but on the left

107
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:04,600
side, it'll be that... because the value here... here is from the

108
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,000
bounded condition at an earlier time. Here is from the bounded condition at a later

109
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,740
time and here is from the bounded condition even at a later time. How do you do

110
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:16,500
stability analysis when the domain is not periodic? So first of all you need to

111
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,040
make sure the discretization if you don't have any boundary condition if it

112
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,260
is periodic it is stable once you have the boundary condition you can do when

113
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:28,260
human stability analysis anymore you need to look at the matrix again so you

114
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:35,500
need to form the matrix and look at whether the matrix has any eigenvalues

115
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:41,520
or that let so I'm just going to slightly touch what you have to do if

116
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:49,740
you have multiple dimensions okay a multiple dimensions you have a domain so

117
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:56,040
let's say this is Omega and you have when you do characteristic speed

118
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:01,920
analysis for example if you have partial u partial u partial T plus this case you

119
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:08,240
has to be a vector right or let me just write it clearly big UX partial u

120
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,160
partial X plus big u y partial u partial

121
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:11,500
y partial u partial t and then you can write this as a vector so you can write

122
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,500
this as a vector so you can write this as a vector so you can write this as a vector

123
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:19,260
if you write this big u vector equal to ux u y then the same equation can be

124
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:27,140
written as partial u partial t plus u vector dot with the gradient of u equal

125
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:37,300
to 0 right and in this case the flux is a vector is equal to the ux u and u y of

126
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:41,140
u which is equal to this big u times small u

127
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:47,700
this is my flux and of course you can still analyze the characteristics the

128
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:54,780
characteristics is partial f partial u which in this case is this vector big u

129
00:10:54,780 --> 00:11:03,640
now you have a vector big you that goes that has a that you can draw on the

130
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:08,740
boundary and in this case it's again it's very clear which part of the

131
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,780
boundary

132
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:16,640
is appropriate for specifying boundary condition can tell me in this case which

133
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,480
part of the boundary is appropriate for specifying boundary condition yes the

134
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,620
part where the velocity goes into the domain so I can specify boundary

135
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:35,780
condition over here here maybe not and over here so this is the range where it

136
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:40,660
is appropriate to specify the boundary condition and the rest of the boundary no

137
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:45,440
boundary conditions all right any questions this is the scalar equation

138
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:51,360
case which generalizes to the system of equation case
