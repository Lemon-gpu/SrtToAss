1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'll give you an example. So let me say if I discretize the time derivative using forward order

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and I assume everybody at least know what forward order is. So it basically takes two time steps.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So k plus 1 and k are two consecutive time steps. One is at t, one is at t plus delta t.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So this is approximation to dEI dt at t equal to tk.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This, let's write down the numerical solution.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:54,000
ek of i plus 1 plus ek of i minus 1 minus 2 ek i plus tau i.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
OK.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:05,000
If you look at this equation, there is a condition for which the solution would not self-amplify.

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The condition is delta t has to be less than delta x squared.

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Do I need over 2? No, I don't need over 2. So delta t has to be less than delta x squared.

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
OK.

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
All right.

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Because otherwise, because otherwise I'm going to derive a matrix equation.

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm going to say e to the k plus 1. I'm going to define it as ek plus 1 1, ek plus 1 2, etc.

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
ek plus 1 n, let's say minus 1.

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
This is going to be a matrix times e to the k.

17
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
e to the k is the same vector.

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:03,000
e to the k is the same vector at k plus this vector tau, which is also tau 1, etc.

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:11,000
tau i, tau n minus 1, also at time step k.

20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So if you look at the matrix, what the matrix is, OK, you probably need to rearrange the terms in this equation.

21
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And this is this is multiplied by delta t.

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So what you need to do is you need to write down ek plus 1 is equal to eik plus delta t over delta x squared times minus 2 eik plus ei plus 1 k plus ei minus 1 k plus delta t tau ik.

23
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And the matrix is going to look like very similar.

24
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:00,000
To the kind of matrix we derived in the last class, but a little bit different because I have this term and I have a delta t term.

25
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So the diagonals, for example, is going to be 1 minus 2 delta t over delta x squared.

26
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Right.

27
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The off-diagonals is just going to be delta t over delta x squared.

28
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So this is the same and the lower diagonal is also the same.

29
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You can take a look at this matrix and you can particularly look at what's called the norm of this matrix.

30
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
OK, so let's say this matrix is A.

31
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The norm of the matrix.

32
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The norm of this matrix defines the norm of the matrix.

33
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Defines the maximum possible ratio of A times E divided by E.

34
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
OK.

35
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And here both the numerator and denominator are the norm of a vector.

36
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So, for example, norm of the vector E.

37
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So E is a vector.

38
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
OK.

39
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And here the numerator is defined as the length of the vector.

40
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So EI 1 squared plus E2 squared plus etc plus EI minus 1 squared.

41
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
So this.

42
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
By the way, there are many different norms.

43
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
This is one of the most commonly seen norm.

44
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's usually called the 2 norm because of the squares are power of 2.

45
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And if I'm using 2 norms for the vectors,

46
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
the matrix norm is also called the 2 norm.

47
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
The matrix norm is inherited from the vector norm.

48
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
OK.

49
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So now if the norm of the matrix is less than 1,

50
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm fine because E is equal to A times E plus a truncation error.

51
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
If the truncation error is small,

52
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
then the E would be the same order of magnitude as the truncation error.

53
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It would not self-amplify.

54
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
If the norm of the matrix is greater than 1,

55
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
no good.

56
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Even if I have a small delta t,

57
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
even if I have a small tau,

58
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
my E is going to amplify to infinity.

59
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
OK.

60
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And the norm of a matrix in MATLAB,

61
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
you can just type norm.

62
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
All right.

63
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So that's a good way to look at the norm in a matrix.

64
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
MATLAB.

65
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Is it for any vector E?

66
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So the definition of the norm is for any vector E.

67
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And the maximization is for any vector E.

68
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So the maximization is for any E not equal to 0.

69
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You are right.

70
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So the maximization is over all possible E's.

71
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So we are going to,

72
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
for some of you this may be the first time we introduce norms.

73
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And if you studied linear algebra,

74
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
you probably also have encountered norms before.

75
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
But like in MATLAB,

76
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
whenever we have a matrix,

77
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
let's say if our identity matrix,

78
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
the norm of a is going to be what?

79
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So if a is an identity matrix,

80
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
what is the maximum possible ratio of aE over E?

81
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
1.

82
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
1, right?

83
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Because aE is going to be equal to E.

84
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So norm of a is going to be 1.

85
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
All right.

86
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
If a is equal to 2 times identity,

87
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
what is the norm of a?

88
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
2.

89
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It's 2, right?

90
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Because this is going to be 2E over E.

91
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So it's going to be?

92
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You need to learn it.

93
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Huh?

94
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Yeah.

95
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Absolutely.

96
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Oh, yeah.

97
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Right.

98
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I have a norm equal to 2.

99
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Yeah, thank you.

100
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I was freaking out.

101
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Yeah.

102
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So,

103
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
so,

104
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
so,

105
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
so,

106
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
so,

107
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
so,

108
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
so,

109
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
so,

110
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
so,

111
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So this is going to be.

112
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Oh,

113
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
yeah.

114
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Okay.

115
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Yes?

116
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
To get e here,

117
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
like,

118
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
do we need to know ua first?

119
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So I think the derivation assumes that we,

120
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
like,

121
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
already know u sub a for us to be able to

122
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
find the matrix for E.

123
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Is that right,

124
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
or,

125
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I mean,

126
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
if we ...

127
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So is...

128
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Go back one slide.

129
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Go back one slide.

130
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Yes.

131
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So to find the equation for E,

132
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
we assume that we know u sub a,

133
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
i,

134
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
the plus 1,

135
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
and u sub a,

136
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
i,

137
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
1.

138
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,200
u sub a minus one and so on and so forth.

139
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,640
But in most cases, we don't know what's,

140
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,860
we want to solve for u sub a.

141
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,440
You're right, we don't know what u sub a is.

142
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,680
It's an analytical solution.

143
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,140
Most cases, we don't have it.

144
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,860
And luckily, in this error equation,

145
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,520
although u sub a appears in the beginning,

146
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,880
so in the green part, you see u sub a appears, right?

147
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,660
But once we get to the red equation,

148
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,520
the e's has no u sub a.

149
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,580
The only u sub a appears in which term?

150
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,800
Appears in the tau, right?

151
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,400
So only the source term, only the tau,

152
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,660
has analytical solution in it.

153
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,180
And although we don't know what tau is,

154
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,900
because the exact value of tau depends on analytical solution,

155
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:07,660
we did tailor series analysis to know how fast

156
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,980
does tau go to zero, as I refined that.

157
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So we can say that the error equation is equal to delta x.

158
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And that is the good thing about the error equation,

159
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
is that we don't know what tau is,

160
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
but we know the order of magnitude of tau

161
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
through tailor series analysis.

162
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And all the other terms does not depend on

163
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
the analytical solution.

164
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Right.

165
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Any other questions?

166
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Yes?

167
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
So if you have a stable name matrix,

168
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
because I'm like, like, client-like,

169
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,720
I'm not going to be able to do that.

170
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:39,920
Right.

171
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,920
There is a steady state solution for E.

172
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,920
If I have a, if we have a stable A,

173
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,920
can I make the claim that I have a steady state solution for E?

174
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,920
Yes.

175
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:59,920
This, the answer is yes if tau i does not depend on time.

176
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,920
All right.

177
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,920
So, so tau remember is the difference between the operator,

178
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,640
the discrete operator and the continuous operator,

179
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,640
operated on the analytical solution.

180
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,640
So if the analytical solution reaches a steady state,

181
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,640
then yes.

182
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,640
If the analytical solution doesn't reach a steady state,

183
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,640
for example, in the project when you are controlling the U

184
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,640
and you make U sometimes bigger, sometimes smaller,

185
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,640
then the analytical solution does not reach a steady state.

186
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,640
And your E also would not reach a steady state.

187
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:38,640
But you can bound this magnitude if you can bound the magnitude of tau.

188
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:49,640
All right.

189
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,640
Okay.

190
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:56,640
So, so the norm of A is going to be something that,

191
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,640
that you can use to analyze stability of the solution.

192
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:07,640
And this particular matrix, for example, we can,

193
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,640
we can call this,

194
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,640
dT dx2.

195
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:18,640
Let's call this as dT over dx square.

196
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:24,640
If this is equal to 0.5, okay, we are going to be making a matrix A

197
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,640
that is equal to 1 minus 2 times dT over dx square in the diagonal.

198
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:36,640
So this is 1 minus 2 times dT dx square times identity of,

199
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,640
let's say, 100.

200
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,640
Okay.

201
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,640
So,

202
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,640
A is that thing.

203
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:46,640
Oh, it's actually, this is actually 0.

204
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,640
And for I goes from 1 to 99,

205
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:54,640
we are going to say A of I, I plus 1,

206
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,640
is equal to dT dx square.

207
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:03,640
A of I, I plus 1 and I is also equal to dT dx square.

208
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,640
So A is this matrix.

209
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,640
If you type norm of A,

210
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:11,640
you get something smaller than 1.

211
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:16,640
But if dT dx square is equal to, let's say, 1.5,

212
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,640
you are out of luck.

213
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:26,640
Because you take A equal to this and you do the same thing.

214
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:30,640
Norm of A is going to be 4.99.

215
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,640
And you are going to get,

216
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,640
so every time E is amplified by a factor of almost 5,

217
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,640
you are going to get infinity.

218
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:41,640
You are going to get infinity after a pretty finite number of time steps.

219
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,640
Yes?

220
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,640
Did you say the condition for stability was A less than 1?

221
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,640
Yes.

222
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,640
I'm sorry, norm of A is less than 1.

223
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,640
Right.

224
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,640
Norm of A has to be less than 1.

225
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,640
All right.

226
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:59,640
Any other questions?

227
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,640
Okay.

228
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,640
So why is the norm larger than 1 still being unstable?

229
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,640
Why is it going to be unstable?

230
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,640
Because if the norm is greater than 1,

231
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,640
that's actually a good question.

232
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,640
I forgot to mention that.

233
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,640
If the norm is larger than 1,

234
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,640
that means there exists an E.

235
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:24,640
That makes A times E to be larger than E.

236
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:28,640
Right?

237
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,640
And no matter,

238
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,640
so if you look at the solution,

239
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,640
the truncation error tau,

240
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:39,640
tau may have maybe a linear combination of many components.

241
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:45,640
But only if there is one component that lies along that solution,

242
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:51,640
that component is going to be amplified.

243
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,640
And over many time steps,

244
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,640
if it keeps being amplified,

245
00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:00,640
you get an unstable solution.

246
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,640
So we'll discuss more about that later.

247
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:08,640
So the norm of A to be less than 1 is a sufficient,

248
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,640
but not necessary condition for stability.

249
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,640
Okay.

250
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:16,640
There are actually some cases where the norm of A can be larger than 1.

251
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,640
You can still be stable.

252
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,640
You need an eigenvalue analysis of A

253
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,640
to figure out exactly if the scheme is going to be stable or not.

254
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:29,640
You need the maximum eigenvalue to be actually less than 1.

255
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,640
So in some cases,

256
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,640
even if your eigenvalues are all less than 1,

257
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,640
the norm can still be larger than 1.

258
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,640
But usually the norm is,

259
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,640
if you can make sure the norm is less than 1,

260
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,640
you are sure you get a stable scheme.
