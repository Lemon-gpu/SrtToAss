1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,420
so for the remaining time let's go into

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:11,220
MATLAB and try to implement at least

3
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,960
one of the limiters and see how to

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:22,440
integrate what we learned together so

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,260
we're going to use Berger's equation

6
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:29,180
not Berger but Berger's equation as an

7
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:40,400
example t and u du dt so any finite

8
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,800
volume scheme we are going to compute n

9
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,400
is equal to length of u and dx is equal

10
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,720
to 1 divided by n

11
00:00:54,260 --> 00:01:00,380
so we are going to reconstruct u of i

12
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:08,720
plus half and left and we are going to

13
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,360
also reconstruct the u of i plus half

14
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,500
right

15
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:18,440
alright and once we reconstruct this we

16
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,260
are going to apply apply good enough

17
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,380
scheme

18
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:32,500
to compute f and this is f at the

19
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,620
interfaces and I'm going to say f is

20
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:42,860
equal to 0 f 0 so that gets us are gives

21
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,140
us all the boundaries we need and the

22
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,760
du dt would be equal to for any final

23
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,380
volume schemes du dt would be equal to f

24
00:01:53,380 --> 00:02:01,360
2 1 2 n- 1 minus f 2 2 n divided by the x

25
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,360
so that's the grand scheme of how to

26
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,500
compute things so before we do any

27
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,960
reconstruction that's compute the ui

28
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:22,500
minus 1 and ui the ui and ui-1s right so

29
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,480
So let's consider ui plus half left.

30
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:38,140
We first do ui minus 1 is equal to, so let's still imagine zero bounded conditions.

31
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,480
We put zero and u of 1 to n minus 1.

32
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,860
So this is my ui minus 1.

33
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,340
I'm just constructing this as an array.

34
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:48,980
All right.

35
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:52,620
And I also need ui plus 1.

36
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,740
It is equal to u from 2 to n.

37
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,120
And I also put a zero at the end.

38
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,260
That's the value beyond the boundary.

39
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:06,400
Okay.

40
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:17,400
So my ratio here would be ui plus 1 minus ui.

41
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:18,960
Okay.

42
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:31,040
Divide by ui minus 1, u minus ui minus 1.

43
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,620
So this is my r.

44
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:34,700
Okay.

45
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,840
So if I use Van Leer limiter.

46
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,300
So let's just use a general limiter function.

47
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,260
phi is equal to limiter of r.

48
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,360
So I'm going to write a limiter here.

49
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,240
So I'm going to write a function.

50
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:54,320
phi is equal to limiter r.

51
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,400
Okay.

52
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,680
So for example, if I want the Van Leer limiter,

53
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:08,680
I would be saying phi is going to be equal to,

54
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,380
let's look at what we have.

55
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,580
It's either zero or 2r divided by 1 plus r.

56
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:21,920
So let's first compute 2r divided by 1 plus r.

57
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:29,120
And phi of whenever r is less or equal to zero would be equal to zero.

58
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,120
All right.

59
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:40,660
Another case we want to take care of is when r is going to be a zero divided by zero,

60
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,640
which is not a number.

61
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,400
So phi of any not is finite.

62
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:50,520
So if I write r, I'm going to set it to zero.

63
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,160
Because remember when we actually use the limiter,

64
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:59,620
phi is going to be multiplied with the difference.

65
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:00,920
Where is phi?

66
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:08,080
When we use the limiter, phi is going to be multiplied with the ui minus ui minus 1.

67
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,320
So if we get a divide by zero, we are also in r.

68
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,360
When we use phi, phi is going to be multiplied by 1.

69
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,860
So phi is going to be multiplied by zero.

70
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,860
So in that case, when r is equal to not a number infinity,

71
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,860
it doesn't matter what the value of phi is as long as it's not a number.

72
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,360
I am fine.

73
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,860
So this is going to be my implementation of the Van Leer Limiter.

74
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,860
Any questions?

75
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,860
Pardon?

76
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,860
Line 9 has to be dotted by line 9.

77
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,860
Line 9?

78
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,860
Oh, yeah.

79
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,860
Thank you.

80
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,860
All right.

81
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:44,860
Okay.

82
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,860
So what we're going to do is we're going to do a little bit of a test.

83
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:53,360
So once I compute the phi, I can compute ui plus half left.

84
00:05:53,360 --> 00:06:07,360
It's going to be, according to my formula, it's going to be ui plus half of ui minus ui minus 1.

85
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,360
ui minus ui minus 1.

86
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,860
And I'm going to compute the next one, which is ui plus 1, right?

87
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,860
times my phi.

88
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:26,360
That completes my reconstruction of the flux at the left.

89
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,360
Reconstructing the flux at the right is very similar, but I go from the right.

90
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:37,360
So instead of ui minus 1, so I already have ui minus 1.

91
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:43,360
So what I need here, the equivalence of ui minus 1 is ui plus 2, right?

92
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:49,040
So that's the cell away on the right and away from the interface.

93
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:55,360
It's equal to ui plus 1, 2 to the end, 0.

94
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:01,600
So I further shifted using ui plus 1.

95
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,320
Okay.

96
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:13,600
And my r in this case is going to be...

97
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:19,600
Okay, instead of ui plus 1 minus u, I have ui minus 1 minus...

98
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,120
Wait, is that ui plus 1?

99
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:23,800
Okay.

100
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So let me write down the formula first for the right reconstruction.

101
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,480
Otherwise...

102
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,580
So ui plus half left.

103
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:51,480
Is equal to ui plus ui minus ui minus 1 divided by 2.

104
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,880
That's the slope times dx.

105
00:07:54,940 --> 00:08:03,560
Times phi of ui plus 1 minus ui divided by ui minus ui minus 1.

106
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:09,600
And ui plus half from the right is equal to...

107
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,580
In this case, i plus 1.

108
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,700
i plus 2.

109
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:22,580
So this is going to be playing the role of ui minus 1.

110
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,100
Ui plus 1 is going to play the role of ui.

111
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,740
And i is going to play the role of...

112
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,580
Not here.

113
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,320
i is going to play the role of ui plus 1.

114
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:34,880
Right?

115
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,420
So I'm looking at here.

116
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:43,580
When I'm constructing the left, I'm looking at these three cells.

117
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,820
So when I'm constructing the right, I'm looking at these three cells.

118
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:54,880
So on the right would be ui plus 1 plus half of...

119
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,140
Instead of ui, I have ui plus 1.

120
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:04,240
Instead of minus ui minus 1, I have minus ui plus 2.

121
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,600
Times phi of...

122
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,600
Instead of ui plus 1, I have ui.

123
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,580
Instead of ui, I have ui plus 1.

124
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:21,780
And ui minus ui minus 1 would be ui plus 1 minus ui plus 2.

125
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,320
Right?

126
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,360
Does it make sense?

127
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,920
I'm just flipping the indices.

128
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,200
Okay.

129
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:38,200
So my r would be equal to this value, ui minus ui plus 1...

130
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,200
...

131
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,200
...

132
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,080
...

133
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,140
...

134
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:43,200
...

135
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,260
...

136
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:43,280
...

137
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:43,300
...

138
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:43,320
...

139
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:43,340
...

140
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:43,360
...

141
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:43,380
...

142
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:43,400
...

143
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:43,420
...

144
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:43,440
...

145
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:43,460
...

146
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:43,480
...

147
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,280
...

148
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,460
...

149
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:47,760
...

150
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,260
...

151
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:48,760
...

152
00:09:48,760 --> 00:10:05,000
...

153
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,780
...

154
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:09,820
...

155
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:10,920
...

156
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,000
...

157
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,300
...

158
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:27,900
ui plus 1 minus ui plus 2 times 5. Alright, any questions so far?

159
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:34,840
Here should be dot multiply, here should be dot multiply. Any other bugs you see

160
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,240
in here?
