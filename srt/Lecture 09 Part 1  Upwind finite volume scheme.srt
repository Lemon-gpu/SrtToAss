1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,380
So last lecture we started the general formulation of finite volume schemes.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,880
So we store the cell averages, ui is equal to 1 over delta x,

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:20,320
times the integral from xi minus half and xi plus half of u dx.

4
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,680
So remember, the first class cities in finite volume is now the cell averages

5
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,000
and the cells itself.

6
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,800
The grid points lies in between the cell averages.

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:41,760
So they are second class citizens and we use the i plus half, i minus half to denote them.

8
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,780
So this is our definition of ui bar.

9
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:51,460
And in the future, in finite volume, I will just use ui to denote them

10
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,340
because whenever I say ui, it's actually the cell average.

11
00:00:54,340 --> 00:01:01,560
Okay, so the time derivative of a cell average,

12
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,860
so I will just say ui equal to this,

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:14,480
the time derivative of ui is going to be exactly 1 over delta x

14
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:20,920
times f of i minus half minus fi plus half.

15
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,180
This is exact. Again, this is exact.

16
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:35,540
This is exact if my f of i plus half is equal to f of u at xi plus half.

17
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,000
And so is xi minus half.

18
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:44,800
The reason finite volume is an approximation is not going to solve the equation exactly

19
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,920
is because we don't have the value of u at xi plus half.

20
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,960
We only have the cell averages.

21
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,320
So we need to...

22
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:08,820
We need to approximate f of i plus half from the cell averages.

23
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,620
Averages of u.

24
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,840
Okay, so in the last class, we did a central difference type of approximation,

25
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,180
not central difference, a central average.

26
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,780
Type of approximation.

27
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,160
We computed f on the cell average values

28
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,620
and we just averaged two neighboring cells to get the flux.

29
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:41,040
It turns out to be a working scheme before any discontinuity developed.

30
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:42,340
Right?

31
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:47,460
And after some discontinuity, after a shock wave is developed, what happened?

32
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,540
Oscillation starts to form.

33
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:54,240
Right?

34
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,180
The solution goes crazy.

35
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,280
And we didn't want that.

36
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:06,240
So today we are going to discuss a very crude way to fix that problem.

37
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,660
That's called an upwind scheme.

38
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,560
Okay, so the upwind scheme.

39
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,660
So it's a way to fix the oscillations.

40
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:18,760
Oscillations.

41
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:27,160
Around shocks.

42
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:29,920
Okay.

43
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,760
So the motivation of that is still looking at the X-T diagram.

44
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:46,580
The X-T diagram is a diagram when we saw on the screen that the characteristics were straight lines.

45
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,500
Remember that?

46
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,680
So we see straight lines being characteristics.

47
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,200
Right?

48
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,440
And straight lines being characteristics.

49
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,860
And in between these straight lines, when the straight lines meet, there is a shock wave.

50
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,880
And the shock wave is not necessarily going to be straight.

51
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,080
It can curve.

52
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:08,460
Right?

53
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,440
So this is what we see in the X-T diagram.

54
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:18,660
In the X-T diagram, and we know that the central difference has problems around the shock wave.

55
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:18,720
Right?

56
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:18,740
So we know that the central difference has problems around the shock wave.

57
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:27,920
So we look around the shock waves to see what is special on the X-T diagram around shock waves.

58
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:39,380
It turns out that what's special is that information in the conservation law only propagates in one direction.

59
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,060
It either propagates towards the left or propagates towards the right.

60
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,580
And around shock waves,

61
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:54,700
information may be propagating in different directions on different sides of the shock wave.

62
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:03,180
So the motivation it gives us is that when we compute the flux,

63
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,860
perhaps we shouldn't be averaging the value at both sides.

64
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:14,920
We should be emphasizing one side of the interface more than the other side.

65
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:14,940
Right?

66
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,320
And which side should we emphasize more?

67
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:18,740
Which side?

68
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:22,020
Which side should we use more information from?

69
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,180
When we are computing f of i plus half,

70
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:38,500
let's say instead of taking the straight average between f of ui and f of ui plus 1,

71
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:42,020
let's say if we want to weigh them, one heavier than the other,

72
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,640
which one should we weigh more?

73
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,320
Yes?

74
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:47,400
Yes?

75
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:52,780
Whichever side the wave is coming from.

76
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:53,500
Right?

77
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,120
I want to weigh whichever side is coming from more.

78
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:06,120
So an extreme of that is I want to say it is either equal to f ui or f ui plus 1,

79
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,800
depending on the local speed of characteristics.

80
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:13,760
Right?

81
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:18,100
So, for example, and we know in a discontinuity,

82
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:27,680
let's move it to here, f ui or f ui plus 1.

83
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:34,240
The two cases are, we know that if we have a true discontinuity,

84
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:39,400
then a shock wave would be forming and moving towards a certain direction.

85
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:48,200
And the speed of the shock wave is going to be f of ui minus f of ui plus 1 divided by f ui.

86
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,200
So, if we have a true discontinuity,

87
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,200
then we can say that f of ui minus f ui plus 1 divided by ui minus ui plus 1.

88
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:59,200
If this one is less than 0, the wave would be moving towards the left,

89
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,060
in which case we want to use the right.

90
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,860
So, if it is greater than 0, the wave is moving towards the right,

91
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,500
and we want to use ui instead of ui plus 1.

92
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:10,280
Right?

93
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:15,880
And when it is less than 0, we want to use ui plus 1 rather than ui.

94
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,200
Yes?

95
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,520
I didn't hear a pal.

96
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:24,700
This is by considering there is a discontinuity at x i plus half.

97
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,280
Yes.

98
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,040
And in finite volume approximation,

99
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:36,820
this way of thinking is to approximate the solution as a piecewise constant function.

100
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:37,660
Right?

101
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,360
This is as if I'm saying, I only have the cell averages.

102
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,200
How do I reconstruct the solution from the cell averages?

103
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,200
This is a very crude way of performing.

104
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:53,600
That reconstruction is to say, on every cell, the solution is just a uniform constant.

105
00:07:54,600 --> 00:08:02,060
Then, a small chocolate is going to be, I mean, a big chocolate is going to be formed at every interface.

106
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,880
And this is how I'm computing the speed of that shockwave.

107
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:07,800
Right?

108
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,060
Okay.

109
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:17,200
So, let's implement that scheme to see if that gets rid of our problem.

110
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,200
Okay.

111
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:26,840
And in this case, before we implement that scheme, let's actually simplify this notation a little bit.

112
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:35,660
Because if we evaluate this formula, delta f by delta u in brute force, we actually have a problem.

113
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:41,660
Because ui can be almost exactly equal to ui plus 1 in some cases.

114
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,940
And we would be getting something divided by 0.

115
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,880
I mean, we would get 0 divided by 0.

116
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,180
Because f of ui is 0.

117
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,380
It's going to be equal to f of ui plus 1.

118
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,180
So, 0 divided by 0.

119
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,560
A computer would get, like, not a number.

120
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,960
And we'll be screwed after a while.

121
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:06,420
So, we want some way to evaluate this ratio without having to encounter a NAND problem.

122
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:07,700
Okay.

123
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,220
So, for example, Berger's equation.

124
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,500
A simple way to get rid of that is by plugging the formula for f.

125
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,600
Into that equation.

126
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:37,780
So, we are going to get f of ui minus f of ui plus 1 divided by ui minus ui plus 1 would be just equal to half of ui plus ui plus 1.

127
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,100
Right?

128
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,680
By plugging the half of u square formula.

129
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,740
All right.

130
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,980
So, the upwind.

131
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:48,760
Scheme.

132
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,180
In finite volume.

133
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,780
Is determining.

134
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,980
Is looking at the average value of the solution on both sides of the interface.

135
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:06,080
And choosing the side to bias according to the average solution in Berger's equation.

136
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,980
So, let's go to MATLAB.

137
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:16,680
And write a new function called ddt upwind.

138
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,480
And let's do that with a t and u.

139
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,360
And ddt.

140
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:31,800
So, still the first thing to compute is the f bar.

141
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:37,320
So, the cell averaged flux is equal to u squared divided by 2.

142
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,880
So, that's still the same.

143
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:40,960
All right.

144
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:47,820
And so, speed of the characteristics or speed of the shockwave.

145
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,180
Let's say.

146
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:57,740
Ss is equal to u of 2 to n plus u of 1 to n minus 1 divided by 2.

147
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:58,400
Right.

148
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:04,860
So, that's what is going to be deciding if we are going to use upwind or downwind.

149
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,160
Yes?

150
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:13,940
So, in this case, because f is u squared over 2, we were able to conveniently get rid of the differences.

151
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:14,720
Yes.

152
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,160
But there are cases where that's not going to be.

153
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:18,440
Okay.

154
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,300
Okay.

155
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:25,860
So, you are concerned when you don't have an analytical formula you can use in general.

156
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:34,740
So, if you don't have an analytical formula to use in general, you have to separate the case where ui is almost equal to ui plus 1.

157
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:39,640
In that case, if ui is almost equal to ui plus 1, what is this?

158
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,880
What is the ratio?

159
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,440
Delta f over delta u.

160
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,740
The derivative of f to u.

161
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,180
Right.

162
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,140
So, generally.

163
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,480
You have like an epsilon criterion.

164
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:58,000
If the difference between ui and ui plus 1 is less than like 10 to the minus 6 or something, you use the derivative formula.

165
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,140
If it's larger than that, you use the delta formula.
