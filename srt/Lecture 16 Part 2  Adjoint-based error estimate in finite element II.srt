1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,440
So there is a potential pitfall here. A potential pitfall here is to approximate this solution v using exactly the same numerical method as what I solved for u h.

2
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:35,100
That sometimes doesn't work. Because the pitfall here is that if I solve for a, so let me see, I have a L o of u h minus u, I have already represented as a of u h, u hat, which is the adjoint solution minus L of u hat.

3
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:42,420
So if I approximate this by a of u h.

4
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:54,940
L of u h and u hat of h minus L of u hat of h, where u hat of h is solved using exactly the same method as I solved for this u h.

5
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:02,340
For example, if I have Poisson's equation, remember our a is symmetric, right?

6
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,500
So a of u and v is equal to a of v and u.

7
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,500
If a is symmetric, what is its adjoint operator?

8
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,420
It's itself, right?

9
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,160
Symmetric is also called self-adjoint.

10
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:24,160
Okay, and then I can basically replace the right-hand side and solve using exactly the same numerical method.

11
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:28,920
But what is the problem if I do that for approximating this u hat?

12
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,340
Yes, this would be zero.

13
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,120
Exactly.

14
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:42,340
So if u hat of h belongs to this...

15
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,620
This finite dimensional space, xh of v.

16
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:57,160
Then, by definition of the finite element solution, so remember the finite element solution, u h,

17
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:07,180
it's that particular u h in the finite dimensional space that makes the residual equal to zero for any v in this space.

18
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,940
My approximate residual is going to be zero.

19
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,080
Okay.

20
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:20,480
So I cannot use the same numerical method or the adjoint version of the same numerical method.

21
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:26,420
So for that particular u hat.

22
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:33,400
The normal practice is to have a richer basis, is to have one...

23
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:40,900
For example, if I solve u using piecewise linear basis function, I can solve for u hat using piecewise.

24
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,000
Okay.

25
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,040
So I can solve u using piecewise linear basis function.

26
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:50,100
And that will give me a higher order solution for this u hat and give me a proper area estimate, a posteriori area estimate.

27
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,160
So the posteriori area estimate is not going to be free.

28
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,420
You need to spend additional effort to get that.

29
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,100
All right.

30
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:07,680
So normally, u hat is approximated...

31
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:07,980
Approximated...

32
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,820
Approximated...

33
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:17,560
with higher order solution.

34
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,380
Or you can just refine the grid by one more factor

35
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,860
and solve for u hat h.

36
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:28,460
All right.

37
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,740
Okay, so this finishes our discussion on error estimation.

38
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,620
And the remainder of this lecture

39
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,900
will go into more than one dimension,

40
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,840
go to two-dimensional finite elements

41
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,120
to see how do we apply what we have learned

42
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,780
into higher dimensions,

43
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,540
which can deal with more complex geometry.
