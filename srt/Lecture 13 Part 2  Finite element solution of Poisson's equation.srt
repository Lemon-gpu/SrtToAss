1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,280
The example I'm going to give is the one-dimensional Poisson's equation.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:15,360
The Poisson's equation is the second-order derivative of u plus a known function f is equal to 0.

3
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:24,640
And let me solve this within the spatial domain of 0 and 1 with the simplest type of boundary conditions.

4
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:32,120
In this case, we no longer know what the solution u is.

5
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:36,400
We only know that the solution u satisfies a certain differential equation.

6
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,140
So how do we use the same procedure we discussed before to solve this equation?

7
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,900
It turns out there are two ways to look at this.

8
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:53,900
The first way.

9
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:01,860
Is to try to integrate this equation with a function.

10
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,540
Right, so approach one.

11
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,540
So let...

12
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:23,540
So I'm going to let a function g also...

13
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:24,540
To...

14
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,140
To be 0 and 1.

15
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,920
To be...

16
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,620
Let's say to be smooth.

17
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:31,860
Okay.

18
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:38,700
And what I'm going to do is that because this equation is equal to 0 within the whole domain.

19
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:46,620
I can integrate g of x times the residual of the differential equation.

20
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,420
Which has to be equal to 0 everywhere.

21
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,340
So this should be equal to 0 within the whole domain.

22
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,420
And because this function is...

23
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,940
Is equal to 0 within the whole domain of .

24
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:02,340
The integration of this function over space should be equal to 0.

25
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,140
For any smooth function g.

26
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,140
Right.

27
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,640
So basically what I'm going to do is this has to be true for any g.

28
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,140
Right.

29
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:17,940
Okay.

30
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:23,840
Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to restrict f and g.

31
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,340
Within the space.

32
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,840
Within the same linear space.

33
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,340
So I'm going to restrict.

34
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:38,540
f is going to be forced to be a linear combination of a certain basis functions.

35
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,740
Phi of x.

36
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,240
And g of x.

37
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:46,140
I'm going to force it to be the actual basis functions.

38
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,740
J goes from 1 to n.

39
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:54,140
The reason I can force g to be any of the basis functions is because if this equality is true.

40
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,640
For any of the phi j's.

41
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:02,440
Then it has to be also true for any linear combination of the phi j's.

42
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,840
Which covers an entire n dimensional linear space.

43
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:09,340
Right.

44
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:10,940
Okay.

45
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,340
So if I perform that restriction.

46
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:17,940
What I'm going to derive out of the equality is.

47
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,740
I replace g with phi j.

48
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:24,640
Okay.

49
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,340
I'm going to.

50
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,840
I'm also going to replace.

51
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,140
Oh.

52
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,340
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,540
I messed up.

54
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,040
I shouldn't be replacing f.

55
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:38,740
I should be.

56
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,540
I should.

57
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,940
I shouldn't be restricting f.

58
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,440
I should be restricting the solution u.

59
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,940
Previously we restricted f because we wanted to approximate f.

60
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,440
In this case we wanted to approximate u.

61
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,240
So we want to represent the solution u.

62
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,840
As a linear combination of.

63
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,340
Of these basis functions.

64
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,840
So we represent u as this linear combination.

65
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,640
So here the u i's are not functions of space.

66
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,440
And phi i's are functions of space.

67
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,140
So we integrate u i.

68
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:12,140
And the second order derivative is going to be applied.

69
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,040
To the basis functions.

70
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,040
All right.

71
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,340
So.

72
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:30,840
Again we are going to pull these summations.

73
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,840
Out of the integral.

74
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,840
What we get is summation of i goes from 1 to n.

75
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,840
u i.

76
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,840
Times the integration of 0 to 1.

77
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,840
Phi j of x.

78
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,840
Times the second order derivative of.

79
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,840
Phi i.

80
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,840
D x.

81
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,840
This is the first order.

82
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,840
So we have.

83
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,840
The second order derivative of.

84
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,840
Phi i.

85
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,840
D x.

86
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,840
This is the first term.

87
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,840
And the second term is.

88
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,840
Is phi j.

89
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,840
Times f.

90
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,840
So.

91
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,840
Plus.

92
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,840
Phi j.

93
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,840
Times f.

94
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,840
D x.

95
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:07,840
Has to be equal to 0.

96
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,840
Right.

97
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,840
The difference between.

98
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,840
This equation.

99
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,840
And the equation we derived last time.

100
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,840
Was that.

101
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,840
The phi i.

102
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,840
Is.

103
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,840
Has been taken a second order derivative.

104
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,840
Well.

105
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,840
Last Wednesday.

106
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,840
We.

107
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,840
When we tried to approximate.

108
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,840
Just a function f.

109
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,840
Basically.

110
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,840
Instead of solving.

111
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,840
A second order derivative of.

112
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,840
Phi u.

113
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,840
Plus f equal to 0.

114
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,840
We were basically solving.

115
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,840
Minus u plus f equal to 0.

116
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,840
Right.

117
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,840
We are trying to approximate.

118
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,840
F with.

119
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,840
A function.

120
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,840
So.

121
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,840
In this case.

122
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,840
We.

123
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,840
We simply.

124
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,840
Replace.

125
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,840
The.

126
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,840
Phi i here.

127
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,840
By the second order derivative of phi i.

128
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,840
So.

129
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,840
The following is the same.

130
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,840
This.

131
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,840
And this.

132
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,840
Is.

133
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,840
Represented.

134
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,840
As.

135
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,840
A matrix.

136
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,840
And a vector.

137
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,840
Respectively.

138
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,840
So.

139
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,840
If I define.

140
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,840
A i j.

141
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,840
To be equal to.

142
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,840
Integration.

143
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,840
Of.

144
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,840
Phi j.

145
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,840
Times the second order derivative of i.

146
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,840
I am going to.

147
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,840
Say.

148
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,840
B j.

149
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,840
Is.

150
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,840
Equal to.

151
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,840
The integration.

152
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,840
Of.

153
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,840
Phi j.

154
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,840
Times f.

155
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,840
Then.

156
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,840
This equation.

157
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,840
Is.

158
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,840
A matrix.

159
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,840
Equation.

160
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,840
A u.

161
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,840
Plus.

162
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,840
B.

163
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,840
Equal to.

164
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,840
Zero.

165
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,840
Right.

166
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,840
And that is something.

167
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,840
I know.

168
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,840
How to.

169
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,840
Solve.
