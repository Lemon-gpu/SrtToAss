1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,540
We have essential boundary conditions, and we have natural boundary conditions.

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:14,180
Essential boundary conditions work by restricting the space for which we can have the solution.

3
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:19,880
Natural boundary conditions don't restrict the space. It comes out naturally from the weak form.

4
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:25,860
What type of boundary conditions did we set in the two-dimensional example we just went through?

5
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:31,840
Essential, because we are restricting the space. We're removing degrees of freedoms on the boundary.

6
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:41,840
So let's also discuss what we can do for natural boundary conditions.

7
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:49,320
So we have the divergence of gradient of u plus f equal to zero.

8
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,680
We cannot have the numerous boundary conditions everywhere.

9
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,000
So let's say we have split the domain into two parts.

10
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,840
This is partial omega 1, partial omega 2.

11
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:13,020
So let's say u at partial omega 1 is equal to zero, and how do we set the Newman boundary condition?

12
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:22,060
The other domain, we set it as the normal dot with the gradient of u equal to zero.

13
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:25,300
Okay.

14
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,480
So this is usually, for example, if you are solving a heat transfer problem,

15
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:35,300
this is saying that u is the solution of the temperature.

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,660
This is saying that I'm fixing the temperature in this part of the domain.

17
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,620
For example, I'm having this in contact with a heat source or heat sink

18
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:51,200
that maintains that boundary to be a constant temperature.

19
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,920
While on partial omega 2,

20
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:01,860
I have the gradient of the heat dot with the normal equal to zero.

21
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,860
What does that mean?

22
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,860
If I have a heat transfer problem?

23
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:06,860
Yes?

24
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:12,860
The flux is equal to zero, which means no heat goes through the boundary.

25
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,860
It's insulated on the other side.

26
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:16,860
Right?

27
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,860
So these are the two types of boundary conditions we can set,

28
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,860
Dirichlet and Newman boundary conditions.

29
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:24,980
Of course, you can set these two types of boundary conditions.

30
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:25,480
Okay.

31
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,480
So I set this to be non-zero to a certain other value.

32
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,480
That means I'm giving a fixed heat flux through the boundary.

33
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,480
Okay.

34
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,480
So how do we set this type of boundary conditions?

35
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,480
It turns out if we derive the weak form, it'll come out naturally.

36
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:52,480
So the weak form works by integrating the equation with the product of a test function.

37
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:00,480
And through integration by parts,

38
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:08,480
this came out to be V times n dot with the grad of U.

39
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,480
Right?

40
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:17,480
At the boundaries minus the weak form we had before.

41
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,480
Okay.

42
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,480
So we have the weak form.

43
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,480
We have the non-zero.

44
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,480
We have the non-zero.

45
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,480
We have the non-zero.

46
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,480
Okay.

47
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,480
So we have the non-zero.

48
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:39,480
And this boundary term is, it is zero for partial omega 1 because we restrict the space.

49
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,480
And therefore, V is going to be zero at the boundary.

50
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:53,480
It is going to be zero at partial omega 2 because the grad U dot n should satisfy the Newman boundary condition.

51
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,480
Right?

52
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:04,480
So that means we don't need to do anything at partial omega 2 other than not restricting the space to set it to zero.

53
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,480
Okay.

54
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,480
In order for you to satisfy that Newman boundary condition.

55
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,480
So, for example, in the code, let's do a very simple thing.

56
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:21,480
Remember I said this E, the boundary E, is,

57
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:27,480
has a flag at the very end.

58
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:34,480
So here, this 5, I think it corresponds to which edge it is.

59
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:50,480
So, for example, if I plot the P of x direction, E of, so, 0 to 5.

60
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:57,480
E of 1, 1 to 5.

61
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,480
So this is the first edge.

62
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:06,480
And, is that right?

63
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,480
Second dimension.

64
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,480
So this is 1 by, okay.

65
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,480
So then I should do P of 1 and E of 2, 1 to 5.

66
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,480
So this is the x direction of the boundary.

67
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:26,480
This is the x direction of, I'm just plotting the first 5 edges corresponding to the flag 5 equal to 1.

68
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:37,480
And the y direction, what I'm going to get is this.

69
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,480
That's weird.

70
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,480
Oh, I have another bunch of 1s over there.

71
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:48,480
So instead of 1 to 5, I should be setting,

72
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:53,480
setting E of 5 equal to 1.

73
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:59,480
So I'm just going to remove this 1 to 5 by this flag.

74
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:04,480
I have one more thing I need to replace, I guess.

75
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,480
Right, so that's one of the straight edges.

76
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:12,480
So let's take an example of setting one of these straight edges to,

77
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,480
to a Newman boundary condition.

78
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,480
Okay.

79
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,480
The only thing we have to do,

80
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:23,480
is to remove this, is to do a little bit trick on the IB, right?

81
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:30,480
So we did, we figured out IB was equal to all these,

82
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,480
all these edges, right?

83
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:39,480
So now we want to remove a certain set of points from IB.

84
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:44,480
So we want to remove the,

85
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,480
okay.

86
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,480
So let's only,

87
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,480
so let's only keep,

88
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,480
so to make it easier, let's only,

89
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:55,480
let's do Newman boundary condition to all the edges except for one of the edges.

90
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:02,480
So we are going to set it to E of 5 star equal to 1.

91
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,480
So we are going to,

92
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,480
we are going to set IB,

93
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:10,480
which is the value, which is the basic functions we restrict to 0,

94
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:16,480
only for the points along the first edge.

95
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,480
So now IB is going to be a much lower dimension,

96
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,480
it's much less number of points.

97
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,480
It only has 11 points.

98
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,480
So we are going to set 0,

99
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,480
this is bounded condition, only on these 11 points.

100
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:34,480
And all the other bounded conditions, we just don't do anything to it.

101
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,480
And according to our analysis on the natural bounded condition,

102
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:42,480
the bounded condition is naturally satisfied on the other points should be what?

103
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,480
Should be a 0 Newman boundary condition, right?

104
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:53,480
So now we have modified the IB and let's run this again.

105
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,480
And this obviously ran.

106
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:00,480
And let's do a try serve of this time.

107
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,480
All right.

108
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:05,480
So that's the solution we get.

109
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:11,480
Obviously, we are satisfying a 0 Dirichlet bounded condition on this particular edge, right?

110
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:16,480
So that's the edge that we set, still included in the set of IBs.

111
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:21,480
And all the other bounded conditions, let's actually look at the edge on

112
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,480
to make it a little bit more obvious that.

113
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:30,480
So we are, for example, we are looking at the left edge over here, right?

114
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,480
So from this particular point of view,

115
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:38,480
we are actually satisfying the normal derivative equal to 0 condition.

116
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:43,480
The derivative in normal to this edge should be on the horizontal direction

117
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,480
when I view it at this angle, right?

118
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,480
The horizontal direction, the derivative is equal to 0.

119
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,480
If I rotate it again, look at this edge from edge on,

120
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,480
the normal derivative is also going to be equal to 0.

121
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,480
So for any of these other edges, if you look at the normal,

122
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,480
the derivative normal to that edge, it's going to be 0.

123
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,480
So that's how we are satisfying a natural bounded condition.

124
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,480
Right?

125
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:20,480
Questions on this one?

126
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,480
Yes?

127
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:26,480
In the non-square-thick thing, there's a minus,

128
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,480
I can't remember what it comes from.

129
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:35,480
So the second equation on this page, where does that minus come from?

130
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,480
Oh, the minus comes from integration by parts.

131
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,480
So the minus comes from the fact that

132
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:53,480
if, so the integration by parts comes from taking v times gradient of u.

133
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,480
So v is a scalar, gradient of u is a vector, right?

134
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,480
So this is a vector.

135
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,480
So let's define this as a vector.

136
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,480
So let's define this as a w.

137
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,480
It's a vector, right?

138
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:10,480
So if I apply Gauss's theorem on this vector,

139
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,480
which is Gauss,

140
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:16,480
Gauss's theorem on this vector,

141
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,480
which means that the divergence of the vector

142
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,480
integrated over the whole domain should be equal to

143
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:31,480
the normal, output normal times the vector integrated over the boundary of the domain.

144
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,480
Right?

145
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,480
Oh, by the way, thanks for notifying this.

146
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,480
This is,

147
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,480
as opposed to the one-dimensional integration by parts,

148
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,480
the two-dimensional integration by parts is going to give me a boundary integral.

149
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,480
So this term needs to be integrated not in the interior, but over the boundary.

150
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:57,480
So this is ds, over the edge of the boundary.

151
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:06,480
So the interior divergence integral is equal to the boundary normal dot vector integral.

152
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,480
And then if I substitute,

153
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,480
the particular form of w into both left and right hand side,

154
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,480
the left hand side becomes

155
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,480
the divergence of the product of a scalar and the vector

156
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:28,480
is equal to two terms.

157
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,480
This is equal to the gradient of the vector,

158
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,480
dot product with the vector that is already inside,

159
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,480
which is grad of u,

160
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,480
plus v,

161
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,480
which is the scalar,

162
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:50,480
times the divergence of the vector that is already inside,

163
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,480
which is grad of u.

164
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,480
Alright, so this is just a chain rule for vector calculus.

165
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:02,480
And so this is the left hand side,

166
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,480
and the right hand side is,

167
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,480
we also substitute this w,

168
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,480
and that becomes v,

169
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,480
v is a scalar,

170
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,480
so I put it in front,

171
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:18,480
and dot with grad of u, ds.

172
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:25,480
So this is becoming our formula for integration by parsing 2D,

173
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,480
which is basically taking this on the left hand side,

174
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,480
and this on the right hand side,

175
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,480
and this on the right hand side.

176
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,480
Okay, so it says that the left hand side,

177
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:42,480
the integration of v times the Laplacian of a scalar u,

178
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,480
is going to be the boundary integral,

179
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,480
the first term on the right hand side,

180
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,480
v, n dot grad u, ds,

181
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,480
minus integration over the whole domain,

182
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,480
so that's the first term on the left hand side,

183
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,480
grad v dot grad u, dx.

184
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,480
So that's our formula for integration,

185
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,480
by parsing 2D.

186
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,480
That is going to help us derive all these equations.
