1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Okay, now let's take a look at how do we do this for finite, for an example equation.

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,260
Okay, and so let's first look at finite difference.

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:23,120
Let's look at a finite difference approximation to the one-dimensional and two-dimensional Poisson's equation.

4
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,560
So one-dimensional Poisson's equation would be this.

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:41,300
And after we discretize it, we have ui plus 1 minus 2ui plus ui minus 1 divided by delta x squared equal to f of i.

6
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,660
Okay, so let's just look at this equation.

7
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:55,040
Can we already tell which term corresponds to the lower diagonal part,

8
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,540
which term corresponds to the diagonal?

9
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,900
Which term corresponds to the diagonal part and which term corresponds to the upper diagonal part?

10
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:03,640
Can we?

11
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,280
So the first term is lower or upper?

12
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:10,840
Upper, right.

13
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:11,860
So this is u.

14
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,020
How about this term?

15
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,200
It's the diagonal part.

16
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,060
So we are lucky that for all the i's, the diagonal term is non-zero.

17
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,900
So Jacobi iteration is applicable.

18
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:23,860
How about this one?

19
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,540
This is going to be lower diagonal part.

20
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,480
Right?

21
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:33,680
So even without constructing the matrix, we can already apply the Jacobi iteration method

22
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,040
by moving all these terms into different sides.

23
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,000
And of course, this corresponds to the b in our equation.

24
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:47,620
So let's keep the d term on the left-hand side and move all the other terms to the right-hand side.

25
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:56,440
What we have is minus 2 over delta x squared times ui is equal to fi.

26
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:07,340
Minus ui plus 1 over delta x squared minus ui minus 1 over delta x squared.

27
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:09,800
Okay.

28
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:18,200
Jacobi iteration method, what we do is we keep the diagonal part to be an unknown

29
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,580
and the lower and upper diagonal part to be known.

30
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:26,040
So these are index k and ui.

31
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,300
The diagonal part is index k plus 1.

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,800
So this is going to be our iteration.

33
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,040
Right?
