1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,880
So remember in scalar conservation laws we have characteristics. In smooth

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,640
region of the solution we have characteristics and the characteristics

3
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:21,960
determine along which direction if you move in space-time along the

4
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:29,160
characteristics the solution stays the same. In this case we also have

5
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,600
characteristics. So remember in the scalar conservation laws the

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:53,880
characteristics characteristics is df du. Now we have a system of conservation

7
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:59,140
laws. F if you remember becomes the

8
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,360
frequency and

9
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:06,000
r is a number. So please use our freezing

10
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,860
relations for Ready-setting of both equations.

11
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,040
Now let's look at some more small integers.

12
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,580
For many of you characters we have two f's, the f of one and the f of two.

13
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:29,060
F northeast plus Beast z Office and F west or Texas states difference between these files.

14
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:29,120
So if this is an expression for the square when the line is been divided in parallel,

15
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:38,380
We can take derivative of df, dh, dfh, dh, right?

16
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,900
We can also take derivative of fm to h.

17
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:51,260
We can also take derivative of fh to m, and we can also take derivative of fm to m.

18
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:58,460
So we no longer get a characteristic speed as a number.

19
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,980
The characteristic becomes a matrix.

20
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:12,280
When we differentiate the flux with respect to the conserved variables, we get a 2x2 matrix.

21
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:20,660
And if we have gas dynamic equations, which are conservation law with more than two variables,

22
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,280
we get an even bigger matrix.

23
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:28,920
So how do we analyze the behavior of smooth solutions of system of conservation laws?

24
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:33,180
Any suggestions?

25
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,260
Remember, what does the matrix do for you?

26
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:46,260
If you write the primitive form of the equation,

27
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:57,680
we get partial h, partial t, plus the divergence, sorry,

28
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,980
the d.

29
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:09,620
The df, h, dx can be written as df, h, dh times partial h, partial x,

30
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:19,080
plus df, h, dm times partial m, partial x, equal to zero, right?

31
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:25,560
So this is just the expansion of partial f, h, partial x using chain rule.

32
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,300
And partial m, partial t,

33
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:42,960
plus df, m, dh times partial h, partial x, plus df, m, dm times partial m, partial x, equal to zero.

34
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:49,380
Does this form remind you of anything we studied in finite difference?

35
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:57,180
Remember, this is analyzing regions of smooth solutions where finite difference actually works.

36
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,420
If you leave the situation of both n itself and n is also square,

37
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,400
you can write the equation in a simple way to put it--" optionalsa n t str.

38
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,600
You can form a rquimi �.

39
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,460
But tesla equations require some rule,

40
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,020
so we have to always do that.

41
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,200
For example, if f is safe,

42
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,400
then we can have a parjla equation

43
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,620
in this case if z is safe,

44
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,900
it means that zена equals 1,

45
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,380
since there's those situation,

46
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,420
it means that if you put a ע in this equation,

47
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,820
those equations and theseе are safe,

48
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:28,420
there exist to any obse.

49
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:37,180
fH and fM are linear functions of H and M, what is this

50
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:51,400
equation going to look like? Linear advection would be a scalar

51
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:57,820
equation, right? So we have a system of equations. Did we look at system of

52
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:05,680
equations and find a difference? Right? Did your project work on system of

53
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:16,240
equations? Yes, right? And how did you analyze the behavior of system of

54
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:24,580
equations that are written in that form? Try to decouple them, right? And how do you

55
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:27,160
decouple them?

56
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,660
By...

57
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:27,760
By...

58
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:27,780
By...

59
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:27,800
By...

60
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,300
By...

61
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:28,800
By...

62
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,300
By...

63
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:35,120
By diagonalizing this matrix, right? So remember we have these four numbers that

64
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:44,920
forms a matrix. If we can perform eigenvalue analysis to this matrix, the

65
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:51,980
eigenvalues are going to be the characteristic speeds, right? In the

66
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:56,580
project, we had two eigenvalues, one going backward, one going forward, right?

67
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,740
Going two different directions.

68
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:14,240
Of exactly the opposite sign, but the same magnitude. In this case, we can also analyze the eigenvalues of this matrix and get the characteristics speeds.

69
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:23,740
So, for example, in our...

70
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,740
In our...

71
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,740
In our...

72
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,740
In our...

73
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,700
In our...

74
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,200
In our...

75
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:28,700
In our...

76
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,260
This matrix is, in our...

77
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:34,740
This matrix is, essentially, equal to b squared by...

78
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,500
B squared plus b squared.

79
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:44,740
This is also difference, because b squared becomes this one, and trouve between the ones

80
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,700
from nesse Angie to firmore n.

81
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,220
And the Southern

82
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,500
and Southern

83
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,120
can be한다

84
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,160
a

85
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,240
1

86
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:52,640
2

87
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:52,860
3

88
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,160
2

89
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,100
11

90
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:55,660
11

91
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,440
hint

92
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,320
So, who else is going to plot?

93
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:57,460
1

94
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:57,640
2

95
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,800
Right?

96
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,500
So we can obtain our matrix.

97
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:13,800
dFH, dH is equal to what?

98
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,440
Zero, exactly.

99
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:23,280
Well, I should actually here write partial derivative here

100
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:30,560
because now every F is a bivariate function,

101
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,380
not just a univariate function.

102
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,280
So I should write partial derivative here.

103
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,160
So the partial derivative is zero in this case.

104
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:45,980
And partial FM, partial H,

105
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:51,360
is going to be what?

106
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,980
It's going to be...

107
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,320
minus M squared over rho H squared.

108
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,260
Right?

109
00:07:59,260 --> 00:07:59,320
Right?

110
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:05,280
And here is plus rho GH.

111
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,740
So this is the derivative of FM to H.

112
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,600
Now the derivative of FH to M,

113
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,500
that's easy, right?

114
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,120
It's one over rho.

115
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,160
And derivative of FM,

116
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,300
to M,

117
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,780
is going to be also easy,

118
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,520
two times M divided by rho H.

119
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,380
Okay.

120
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,260
So, for example, let's figure out

121
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:44,900
what are the eigenvalues of this matrix.

122
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,640
And I'll show you how to do that.

123
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:53,020
So let's use the symbolic toolbox in MATLAB.

124
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,280
So we are going to define

125
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,980
symbolic variables,

126
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,600
rho, G, H, U.

127
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,420
So I'm going to define rho and U and G and H

128
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,940
as symbolic variables.

129
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,340
So first thing is to compute the momentum.

130
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:22,340
My M is going to be equal to rho times...

131
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,280
U times H.

132
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,280
Right?

133
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:31,280
So that's my definition of momentum.

134
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:36,280
And my matrix A is going to be...

135
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:40,280
It's zero.

136
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:48,280
It's minus M squared divided by rho times H squared.

137
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:52,280
And one over rho.

138
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:52,880
Right?

139
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,880
So I'm going to write rho and the two times M

140
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,880
divided by rho times H.

141
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,880
So that's...

142
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,880
What's the term?

143
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,880
Plus rho G H?

144
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,880
So I'm differentiating this to M,

145
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,880
which I don't think has this, right?

146
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,880
No, the first rho.

147
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,880
The first rho.

148
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,880
Oh, plus rho G H.

149
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,880
Yeah, thank you.

150
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,880
Plus rho times G times H.

151
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,880
Okay.

152
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,880
So let's do eigenvalue of A.

153
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,880
Here's what we get.

154
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:31,880
The two eigenvalues are U times square root of G H

155
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,880
and U minus square root of G H.

156
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:44,880
U plus minus square root of G H.

157
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,880
Okay.

158
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,880
So that tells us something interesting.

159
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,880
So the waves in this shallow world equation,

160
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,880
they...

161
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,880
Of course, it changes as the local velocity changes.

162
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,880
So if U is positive, both waves tends to go towards the right.

163
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,880
If U is negative, both waves tends to go towards the left.

164
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,880
But then, there are two waves.

165
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,880
So this is U and this is rho plus G H

166
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:16,880
and this is U minus G H.

167
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,880
And depending on the rho, the rho is equal to...

168
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,880
And depending on the ratio of U to square root of G H,

169
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:28,880
the flow can be either subsonic or supersonic.

170
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,880
In the sense that if U is greater than square root of G H,

171
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,880
if the magnitude of U is greater than square root of G H,

172
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,880
then both characteristics propagate towards the same direction.

173
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,880
If you put a perturbation somewhere,

174
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,880
the flow wouldn't...

175
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,880
The perturbation would only propagate in one direction

176
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,880
without going towards the other direction.

177
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,880
If U has a magnitude smaller than square root of G H,

178
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,880
then information actually goes towards both directions.

179
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,880
And in nonlinear conservation laws,

180
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,880
we are going to see situations like that all the time.
