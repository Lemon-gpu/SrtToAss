1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So if all my solutions are continuous, are smooth, these features should allow me to

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:18,000
exactly analytically solve this conservation law, right? So actually if

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,200
my solution is continuous I don't really need any numerical methods. So for

4
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:30,860
example I have an initial condition t equal to zero. So let's see I have

5
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:37,460
all the solutions available over here. Then I can basically start from every

6
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,280
point in the solution a characteristic because I know which direction it goes.

7
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,860
For example if I know it's positive I shoot it forward, if I know this is this I

8
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:50,300
shoot it this way, if I know this is negative I shoot it that way, right? So at

9
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,720
every point I can shoot a ray into

10
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,200
this.

11
00:00:54,200 --> 00:01:01,280
The future. And I know the solution along that ray is going to be constant. So I

12
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,700
know all my future solutions, don't I?

13
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:13,880
No. Because these intersect, right? Because these actually run into each other and

14
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:19,380
when they run into each other, should I pick the value on the left or should I pick the

15
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,540
value on the right?

16
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,540
Okay so

17
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:30,120
in here actually I think we actually see a case where there are two lines, I mean

18
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,620
these are discontinuities. I mean we can see things

19
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:39,780
run into each other. So what happens when characteristics run into each

20
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:40,400
other?

21
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,400
What should I pick? Yes?

22
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:53,720
Oh if I have just two values running into, I can do that but like in general I have things

23
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:58,840
continuously run into each other, right? So I have infinitely many characteristic

24
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:04,120
lines and they are continuous, they are everywhere. Here of course I'm only

25
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,960
drawing contours at a discrete level because I mean otherwise the whole thing

26
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:14,480
is going to be black. But in reality things are everywhere. Every single point

27
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,800
has a characteristic line. So I get things everywhere running into each other

28
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:26,000
continuously. So in order for us to analyze that, we need something other

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,440
than the primitive form. This is because once we have things running into each

30
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,860
other we know, okay, immediately towards the left of the solution I still know its

31
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,260
value, immediately towards the right of the solution I know its value, but the

32
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:47,300
solution may be discontinuous over that point.

33
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,000
And

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,500
we

35
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:48,780
have a

36
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:58,780
when things are discontinuous, what do I mean by partial f of u, partial x, over a

37
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:10,440
discontinuity? Okay, what does that mean? If u is not continuous f of u, do I expect

38
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:18,480
to be continuous? No. I mean if I don't even have continuity, not to say differential

39
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:24,480
density, how can I take spatial derivatives? Doesn't make any sense.

40
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:31,140
Right? So the problem about nonlinear conservation laws, the reason we cannot

41
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:36,060
use finite difference is because the characteristic lines, they run into each

42
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,080
other. They are not straight. And because they are not straight, they run into each

43
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,820
other. And the moment they run into each other, it doesn't make any sense anymore

44
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,320
to take a spatial derivative.

45
00:03:48,480 --> 00:04:00,100
So what can we do? Use the integral form. Yes. Otherwise, why are we here studying

46
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:15,540
numerical PDEs? So use integral form. Use integral form. And that's why we got rid of

47
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,480
the spatial derivative by integrating.

48
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:17,980
Okay?

49
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:38,160
Integrating over x. So we have d dt integration over a, b, u, dx plus f of u at b minus f of u at a

50
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:46,960
equal to zero. And let's analyze the behavior around the continuity by choosing a and b very

51
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,960
close to 0.

52
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:53,260
It's very simple.

53
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:53,560
And what makes that möglich?

54
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,120
Samples?

55
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,300
No, no.

56
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,300
So what happens?

57
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:02,640
The key here is this.

58
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,860
So problem boundary can appear in every one of the && double clausIm Arena distribution

59
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:11,340
case when the left and the right of interval is to the right of the

60
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,220
discontinuity.

61
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,680
The right of interval is the solution as such to theclean the binomial of 2siec.

62
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,520
The 돼요 splitting the sceint р venir pastry — toh the跡 Jenn insurance.

63
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,860
associated across individual aspects.

64
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:24,580
is that the value of the function u at a is basically the left-hand side of the

65
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:28,100
discontinuity. So among that discontinuity you can see like you have a

66
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:33,700
range of values. The lowest value which is the right-hand side

67
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:40,580
value is minus 0.6 something and the left value is 0.7 something right so

68
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:50,720
so we have a u left and a u right. So by choosing that interval let's say the

69
00:05:50,720 --> 00:06:04,420
discontinuity is at c and that discontinuity actually moves as

70
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:09,860
time increases. So for example if you look at this thick line

71
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,560
right here. So if you look at this thick line

72
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:10,580
right here. So if you look at this thick line

73
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:18,260
this thick line is a function of of t right. So it moves just like

74
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:22,100
characteristics but they don't follow straight lines. They can turn

75
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,620
right. So let's figure out how do they move.

76
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:32,100
So discontinuity at c of which may depend on time and let's see

77
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:38,500
how it moves. So let's say a is equal to c minus epsilon and b

78
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,560
is equal to c plus epsilon.

79
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,100
that means you

80
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:49,060
at a is equal to you let's say I

81
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,880
you left so the to do not the left value you of

82
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,440
the is equal to you right so

83
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,520
integration of a B you

84
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,940
the axe is equal to what

85
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:07,000
right we have a domain a

86
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,340
be very very small on the left hand side

87
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:14,320
it's you could be you L on the right hand side is equal to

88
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:19,620
you are the interval is so small that we can consider the function to be

89
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,580
constant on the left and right of these

90
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:27,780
shock so what is this into growth you

91
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,940
over the axe yes if you L plus you are

92
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:35,220
are divide by two times absolute

93
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,700
right 0 to absolute yes so it's a

94
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,340
if you L

95
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:44,840
plus you are times absolute yeah that's right okay

96
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,860
so I am I'm interested in

97
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,100
analyzing how that value changes

98
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:57,660
as time evolves because as time increases let's say time increases from

99
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,980
that next level

100
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:02,700
the shock me go over here

101
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,960
right

102
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:10,340
so so what is that what is that

103
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:14,340
wave speed

104
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:18,260
what is that wave speed so what is

105
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,620
discontinued at the let's modify it see

106
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:25,300
plus a shock speed

107
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,420
so SS called shock speed

108
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:32,280
times times T so so let's say this is the

109
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:36,000
this is the are okay so let's let's let's

110
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,260
make it a little bit more rigorous see is a function of T

111
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,760
and we want to compute the shock speed

112
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,080
which is defined as DC over DT

113
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,480
okay and so

114
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:57,300
this a is at see at time equal to zero minus epsilon be is equal to see at

115
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,780
time equal to zero

116
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:03,260
plus accident so at time increases

117
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:07,100
by it infinite has a mode out at T

118
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:12,380
this is at C 0 and this is now at C 0

119
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,800
plus shock speed times this

120
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,160
infinite has a mo DT so you L plus you are times epsilon

121
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,460
are at T equal to zero

122
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:27,780
and at T equal to

123
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:33,180
a very small duty integration of

124
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:36,880
you between a and B has changed by how much

125
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,380
up so this is C 0 right

126
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,340
up in the initial initial time this is

127
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,540
when the shock has moved by a little bit

128
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:52,060
and the speed of the movement is SS so over DT

129
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:55,800
it should moved towards the right by SS times DT

130
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:00,080
and at T equal to DT the total integral

131
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,300
has changed from

132
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,340
this value which is

133
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:12,300
underneath these rat curve to this value

134
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,420
underneath the blue curve so what is the delta what is the change in the

135
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,020
integral

136
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:20,180
the change in the integral is

137
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,200
equal to minus

138
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,340
of this area right the change in the integral

139
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:31,540
is equal to minus of you are

140
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:35,820
minus you L times as

141
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:42,820
DT of course plus the original

142
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,520
X at T equal to zero

143
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,760
can we compute the time derivative DDT of these

144
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,800
integral between a and B

145
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:00,840
is equal to what the difference between these and these

146
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,820
are the difference between these and these

147
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:20,700
verticals and these is the maximum

148
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,740
once the 0s equals b which bar in time

149
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:27,200
DT plus с is equal toтаки same учas

150
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,420
and therds is equal to E's and��라 sul is equal to

151
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,820
f p-E and let me write two plus e's and

152
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,420
ikka

153
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:33,580
0érer

154
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,420
in the integral form of the equation.

155
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,140
Because the first time in the integral of the equation,

156
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:47,480
the time derivative of the total mass within this small interval

157
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:53,600
is equal to the flux at the left minus the flux at the right,

158
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,320
also over this very small interval.

159
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,000
Then I can compute from the difference in the flux

160
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,680
the speed of the shock wave.

161
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,040
So let's do that.

162
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:13,780
So let's write down the integral form of the equation

163
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:18,500
where a and b are very small intervals around the discontinuity.

164
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:29,980
b is equal to f of u at x equal to a minus f of u at x equal to b

165
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:37,080
and this term we know is ul minus ur

166
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:47,800
so ul minus ur times the speed of the shock wave.

167
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,680
How about the right-hand side?

168
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,540
x equal to a, the value of u is exactly ul.

169
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:05,680
So we can calculate that's right at the left of the discontinuity.

170
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,300
So this is equal to f of ul minus,

171
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:14,740
this is x equal to b to the right of the discontinuity,

172
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,240
that's f of ur.

173
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,980
So this is easy.

174
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:23,740
That allows us to compute the speed of the shock wave

175
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,860
being f of ul minus f of ur

176
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,740
divided by ul.

177
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:35,100
So we can get the difference between l minus ur.

178
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,420
Oh, it's a very good question.

179
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,800
Is that df by du?

180
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,800
Right.

181
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,720
So this looks very similar to df du

182
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:48,360
because that looks like a finite difference approximation to df du, right?

183
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,580
But this is special because this is more

184
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:58,660
because df du only works when we have a continuous solution.

185
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,700
So at the limit of a very small interval, we have a continuous solution.

186
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,260
So we have a very, very small discontinuity.

187
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:05,460
This, the speed of this,

188
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:09,180
the speed of this very small discontinuity

189
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:13,700
is actually and should be equal to the characteristic speed

190
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,940
or the speed of the wave.

191
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:20,020
But this formula gives you more.

192
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:23,900
It gives you the speed of a large discontinuity also.

193
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:28,900
It gives you how would a non-infinite,

194
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,820
infinitesimal discontinuity would propagate.
