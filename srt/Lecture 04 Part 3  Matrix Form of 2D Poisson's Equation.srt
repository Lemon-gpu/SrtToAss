1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So now let's discuss how to solve this equation. We have a set of linear equations and it can be potentially a huge number of linear equations.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So if nx and ny are both on the order of 100, you get like 10,000 equations. If both are on the order of 1,000, you get like a million equations.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So how to solve a million coupled equations?

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So the best way is to put it into matrix form.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And one of the things I think you'll learn through going to this class is learn how to put equations into matrix form.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Once you put equations into matrix form, it suddenly becomes easy to solve with computers.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Okay.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And there was a person who was a professor in computer science who said that computers are really good at only two things.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
One is moving and transforming data.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The other is solving linear equations, like doing linear algebra, basically.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And doing linear algebra requires you to transform whatever problem you need to solve into matrices.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And this is what we are going to do.

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Is to transform this equation into a matrix.

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So first of all, how big does the matrix have to be?

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So let's write out the matrix.

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So you can see I planned this to be big, right?

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So this times the solution is equal to a right-hand side.

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
How big is the matrix?

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So let's say given this number of equations and this number of unknowns.

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's the same, right?

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So it's n times columns.

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
n times rows.

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The number of equations stands for the number of rows.

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Exactly.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The number of unknowns is the number of columns.

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So before we write down this matrix, let's first write down the unknowns.

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And the right-hand side of the equations.

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So each equation is one line corresponding, one row corresponding to the matrix.

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And the right-hand side should be equal to the corresponding right-hand side of the equation.

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So let's write down F11 here.

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And of course there are two ways to order the right-hand side.

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You can start with F12, F13.

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Or you can go ahead and write F21, F23.

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Sorry.

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
F21 and F31.

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So let's here adopt the C or Python type of indexing.

37
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So we go F12, F13 all the way to F1 and Y.

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Minus one.

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yes, thank you.

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And if you are using...

41
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So this is basically how a C or Python put an array.

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And if you are using...

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So this is basically how a C or Python put an array.

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And if you are using...

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So this is basically how a C or Python put an array.

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Put an array into memory.

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Because computer memory is actually a 1D, a huge 1D array.

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And if you want to represent a 2D or 3D array of data or matrix, you can arrange the matrix,

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
arrange the data in the matrix in two ways.

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
One is you arrange the second index first or you arrange the first index first.

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
If you use C or Python, you change the second index first.

52
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And you can do that.

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So you start with the first index first.

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And after you cycle through all the second indices, you begin to increment the first

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
index by one.

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
In Matlab or Fortran, it is the other way.

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You increment the first index first.

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And after you cycle through the first index, you start to increment the second index by

59
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
one.

60
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So either way is fine.

61
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I don't have any preference of one way or the other.

62
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
F22, F23, et cetera.

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So either way is fine.

64
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So either way is fine.

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Food galaxii, et cetera.

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So you can think of there is a mental or a logical separation here.

67
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So you can think of there is a mental or a logical separation here.

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
But the computer actually doesn't care.

69
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And I will write dot, dot, dot.

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The last one is gonna be F of nx minus one, one.

71
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And all the way to F, nx minus one, and y minus one.

72
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So as we arrange the equations that way, it makes sense arrangements to arrange the unknowns

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
in the same way.

74
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
F11.

75
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And Y.

76
00:04:47,000 --> 00:05:02,620
So u11, u12, etc. to u1, ny-1, u21, u22, all the way to u2, ny-1, etc.

77
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:06,140
Going through all the u's.

78
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:17,060
And finally, we have u of nx-1, 1, and u of nx-1, ny-1.

79
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,500
Can somebody look at the equation and tell me what the matrix is going to look like?

80
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,760
It's going to be very sparse. That's a very good observation.

81
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,860
Why is it sparse?

82
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:35,860
Because the matrix, each row of the matrix, has nx-1, ny-1.

83
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:40,740
And only how many of them are non-zero?

84
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,560
Five, right?

85
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:55,360
If i and j are away from 1 or nx-1, ny-1, five of them are going to be non-zero.

86
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:04,460
If they are close to the boundary, if i and j are close to the boundary, even less are going to be non-zero.

87
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:05,120
Right?

88
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,500
So at most, five in a row is going to be non-zero.

89
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,820
So let's set an example.

90
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:16,780
The first row, we are considering something equal to f11,

91
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,540
which means this equation has to be i equal to 1, j equal to 1.

92
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,320
Which indices are going to be non-zero?

93
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,720
I mean, which entries on the matrix is going to be non-zero?

94
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,660
Is the first entry going to be non-zero?

95
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,100
Because we have this term and this.

96
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,420
This term in the equation, right?

97
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,280
So u11 is going to appear in the equation.

98
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:40,680
Right.

99
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:48,180
And the coefficient is going to be minus 2 over delta x squared minus 2 over delta y squared.

100
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,160
That's right.

101
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:56,460
And if you think a little bit carefully for all the other i's and j's,

102
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:02,040
the same coefficient are going to appear on the diagonal.

103
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,340
Right?

104
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,660
In the matrix, the diagonal.

105
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,540
So this means the corresponding entry of the unknown

106
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:13,100
is multiplied by the diagonal entry

107
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,540
and equal to the same entry on the right-hand side.

108
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:26,840
Which means we are looking for the term of ij in this linear combination.

109
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:27,600
Right?

110
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,840
The same ij that appears on the right-hand side.

111
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:35,080
So this is always going to be the same number up to,

112
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,800
all the way to the last one.

113
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,720
Minus 2 over delta x squared minus 2 over delta y squared.

114
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,120
Okay.

115
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,300
A big task is done.

116
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,640
We've figured out the diagonal entries.

117
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:54,520
And let's, let's, let's cross out these diagonal entries from this equation.

118
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,140
We already took care of these two.

119
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:01,180
By going through the right-hand side, we also took care of these two.

120
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,740
And now we have four terms left.

121
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:03,880
Okay.

122
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,480
So we have two terms left.

123
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:04,540
Okay.

124
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:04,900
So we have two terms left.

125
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:05,000
Okay.

126
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,100
So we have two terms left.

127
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,260
Okay.

128
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:10,160
Again, if we focus on the first row again,

129
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,900
what other terms are non-zero?

130
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:23,300
The one immediately to the right-hand side of the diagonal is going to be non-zero

131
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,760
because of which term?

132
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:30,760
Because of i plus 1j or ij plus 1?

133
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,300
ij plus 1.

134
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:33,560
Right.

135
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,100
Because we ordered the f.

136
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:35,600
And u.

137
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,280
Because we ordered the u's in this way.

138
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:43,540
So u of 1, 2 is going to be corresponding to this term.

139
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,400
Right.

140
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,200
This is u of 1, 2.

141
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,820
So the coefficient of this one is, of course, 1 over delta y squared

142
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,600
because we are looking at this term over here.

143
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:55,400
Okay.

144
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,700
Is there any other terms that is going to be non-zero?

145
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,060
The one below the diagonal.

146
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,880
But that is another row.

147
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,280
We are focusing on the first row.

148
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,020
There are two more.

149
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:18,960
So first of all, if j is equal to 1, this term is gone.

150
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:19,440
Oops.

151
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,460
Oops.

152
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:23,620
Right.

153
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:28,560
So if j is equal to 1, this term is 0.

154
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,500
And if i is equal to 1, this term is also 0.

155
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,340
So we don't need to take care of these two terms.

156
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:34,700
They only...

157
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,060
The only term left is ui plus 1 and j.

158
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,800
Where is that?

159
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,600
Exactly.

160
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:43,940
Exactly.

161
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:50,780
You need to skip over a bunch of zeros and comes to the entry...

162
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,820
Comes to the...

163
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,380
Which entry?

164
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,600
Comes to the...

165
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,620
N-yth entry.

166
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:57,440
Right.

167
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,280
So this is the N-yth entry.

168
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,140
And I have 1 over delta x squared.

169
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,200
All right.

170
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:09,980
Okay.

171
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,720
Now look at the second row.

172
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,500
Now j is equal to 2.

173
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:23,200
We have the same 1 over delta y squared on the upper diagonal.

174
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,100
Because we still need to take care of this term.

175
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,060
This is u of 1, 3.

176
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:34,400
Now we have one more term on the lower diagonal that corresponds to this one.

177
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,560
That is also 1 over delta y squared.

178
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,280
Okay.

179
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,860
And the delta...

180
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:49,960
1 over delta x term is also going to be shifted by 1 because j is shifted by 1.

181
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,380
All right.

182
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:57,360
And this goes all the way up to here.

183
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,460
Or here.

184
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:04,380
So let's consider this as the first block.

185
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,440
Of the matrix.

186
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,760
The first block of the matrix...

187
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,760
Has...

188
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:17,360
The first block of the matrix, if you don't consider this 1 over delta x squared,

189
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:23,200
is going to have the same tri-diagonal structure as the finite difference in 1D case.

190
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:24,620
Right.

191
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,940
But in addition to that, we get a diagonal block.

192
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:34,480
We get another block that appears over here.

193
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,380
That is just the 1 over delta x squared on the diagonal of the block.

194
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,980
And now the question is, when we get to the last entry...

195
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,980
When we are looking at the last entry, f of 1 and y minus 1.

196
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,980
We have...

197
00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:01,620
The same thing minus 2 over delta x squared minus 2 over delta y squared over here.

198
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,460
We have the same thing 1 over delta y squared over here.

199
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,140
Do we have a minus...

200
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,440
Do we have a 1 over delta y squared over here?

201
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,820
On the right-hand side of this?

202
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:17,000
Diagonal is multiplied by u of 1 and y minus 1.

203
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:26,480
The upper diagonal 1 over delta y squared is multiplied by this.

204
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,620
So ui of j plus 1.

205
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,480
But ui of j plus 1 in this case is u1ny.

206
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,260
u1ny.

207
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,280
Which is 0.

208
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,480
So we don't need to put anything here.

209
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,260
In fact, if we put anything here, it will be wrong.

210
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:45,520
Because it will be multiplied by u of 2, 1.

211
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:48,680
Right.

212
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:54,780
So we are already at this point.

213
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,400
Well, actually, yeah.

214
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,480
We are already at...

215
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,360
So let's say 4 is ny.

216
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,020
We are already at this point.

217
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,380
This is my est here.

218
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,000
But if we move up here, we need to get more information.

219
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,460
So u1 is also aκι plus px.

220
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,760
We also need to multiply.

221
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,460
This is min which is also aki.

222
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:22,920
We added tu which is also 30

223
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,440
minus b1 in the final .

224
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,760
And, u1 is much like ui here.

225
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,160
We just use all the multiplications and nodes together.

226
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,200
Why we also don't need to make laugh a few times.

227
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:33,400
Moreover, c is a יש.

228
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:41,280
u1 and y minus 1 and u2 1 right so the ordering of the grid points are this

229
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:48,940
this this jump over to here and this this jump over back to here and this and

230
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:55,360
this over here and this point is not coupled to this point so there is

231
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:05,180
nothing here so the so the second I index or the second column of in this

232
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:14,980
plot is the same but we are gonna have a block that is the same as this and in

233
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:21,280
addition to a 1 over delta x block over here we also get a 1 over delta x squared

234
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,400
block over here all right

235
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:24,900
and

236
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,700
so so at the end we are going to get

237
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:35,320
what's called a penta diagonal structure so we get one diagonal over here one

238
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:40,860
diagonal immediately above one diagonal immediately below and one diagonal that

239
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:53,420
is an y minus 1 away from the diagonal and we also get another diagonal and Y

240
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,400
minus 1 below

241
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,320
the

242
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:55,360
diagram from the diagonal and we also get another diagonal and y minus 1 below the

243
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,600
main diagram.
