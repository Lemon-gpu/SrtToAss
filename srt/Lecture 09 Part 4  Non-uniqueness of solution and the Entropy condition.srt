1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,260
It can have some small problems in some rare cases.

2
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:12,260
One of the rare cases is what we call an inversed shockwave.

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,640
So in our solution, we have seen a shockwave that looks like this.

4
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,640
So this is u, this is x, this is u equal to 0.

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,560
We have seen a shockwave like that.

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,740
So the inverse shockwave is a shockwave that goes the other way.

7
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:35,640
So if this is 0, it's negative here, jumps to positive here, and then that.

8
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,400
So let's take an example.

9
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:46,620
So this is x equal to 0, and this is u equal to 1, this is u equal to minus 1.

10
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,480
Okay, clear?

11
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,320
What this solution is?

12
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,380
It's basically a Heaviside function.

13
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,440
Minus 1 when x is less than 1, plus 1 when x is greater than 1.

14
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,420
Okay.

15
00:00:59,420 --> 00:00:59,440
Okay.

16
00:00:59,440 --> 00:00:59,460
Okay.

17
00:00:59,460 --> 00:00:59,480
Okay.

18
00:00:59,480 --> 00:00:59,500
Okay.

19
00:00:59,500 --> 00:00:59,520
Okay.

20
00:00:59,520 --> 00:00:59,580
Okay.

21
00:00:59,580 --> 00:00:59,600
Okay.

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:00:59,620
Okay.

23
00:00:59,620 --> 00:00:59,720
Okay.

24
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,140
Okay.

25
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:08,240
If you put this initial condition in the solver we just did, the solution here is going to

26
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,460
stay stationary.

27
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,140
D U D T is going to be 0 for a solution like this.

28
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,000
And why is D U D T equal to 0?

29
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:21,300
The only reason D U D T can be 0 is all the F interfaces are the same, right?

30
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,100
Because D U D T is the difference between two fluxes.

31
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:29,140
So if all the flux values are the same, then D U D T is of course 0.

32
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,720
Why am I claiming f is going to be the same?

33
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,860
Because, well, other than the two boundary conditions.

34
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,440
So let's see if we get rid of the boundary conditions.

35
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,880
So why is f interface the same?

36
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,740
That is because all the f's are the same.

37
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:48,260
All the f's are the same because u is either 1 or minus 1.

38
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:54,820
So when you square this solution u, either 1 or minus 1 is going to get you half.

39
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,300
So all of this vector f is going to be half.

40
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,020
Therefore, all of this f interface is going to be half.

41
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,660
Therefore, du dt is going to be 0.

42
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,060
Any questions?

43
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,200
No, right?

44
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:10,920
So let's say here we don't have a periodic domain.

45
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,480
So let's, for example, if we have a periodic domain, it goes like that.

46
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,480
Then the solution is going to stay the same forever, right?

47
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,520
We have one normal shock over here and one inverted shock over here.

48
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,920
But the inverted shock should not stay there.

49
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,280
It should not exist.

50
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:36,500
So let me answer the question why it should not exist.

51
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:42,560
Why this shock wave should exist and why this shock wave should not exist.

52
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:48,560
Mathematically, there is nothing that says this shock wave shouldn't exist, actually.

53
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,540
If you look at the differential equation, look at, I mean, when shock wave exists,

54
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,700
you shouldn't look at the differential form of the equation.

55
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,280
You should look at the integral form, right?

56
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:02,880
If you look at the integral form, there is nothing that says that this shock wave shouldn't exist.

57
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,140
A stationary solution is a perfectly valid solution.

58
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,680
But you will never see that perfectly valid mathematical solution in real world.

59
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:24,260
Because the differential equation we are solving is just an approximation of the limit of a viscous process as that viscosity goes to 0.

60
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,260
Okay, again, it's a limit of...

61
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:32,300
A differential equation with very, very small viscosity.

62
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:38,540
The Burgess equation we are solving, we actually don't want to solve the Burgess equation.

63
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,540
So let me just write as f of u.

64
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:47,860
We want to solve the Burgess equation with the infinitesimal epsilon times the second derivative of u with respect to x.

65
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,580
That's a viscous term.

66
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:54,120
That's actually why we want numerical viscosity when there is a shock wave, right?

67
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,880
This is the physical viscosity that is there.

68
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,260
We're just taking the limit.

69
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,620
The velocity of epsilon goes to infinity.

70
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:11,980
Now, if you consider this equation, what is the effect of this epsilon term on the shape of the discontinuities?

71
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:17,340
Okay, so if you just think of the heat equation, right?

72
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:22,520
So just don't think about the nonlinear term yet.

73
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,520
Let's just think of the effect of this term.

74
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,160
What is the effect of this term?

75
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,160
It's more of a...

76
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:32,380
It smoothies out non-smooth features, right?

77
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:40,780
So actually near discontinuities, this term is going to be infinitely larger in magnitude than the first-order derivative term.

78
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:48,840
So the effect of this is going to make the shock wave not exactly like this, but like that, right?

79
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,120
So it'll be smoothed out a little bit.

80
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:54,320
The slope of the shock wave is no longer going to be infinity.

81
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,320
Maybe it's still going to be 10 to the 18.

82
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,860
It's still going to be 10 to the 18.

83
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,580
Maybe the first-order derivative is going to be 10 to the 18 or something.

84
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,980
It's going to be very, very large.

85
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,400
But it's not going to be infinity.

86
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:17,320
Now, if you look at the xt diagram, and zoom into this region where on the left hand side it's minus 1, on the right hand side, let's zoom into this region.

87
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,680
At the left hand side, the characteristics is minus 1 going this way.

88
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,260
At the positive side, it's going that way.

89
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,340
But in the middle, there is a very tiny range.

90
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:27,600
Okay.

91
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:27,740
Okay.

92
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,080
Okay.

93
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,220
Okay.

94
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:28,260
Okay.

95
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:34,140
of solutions that are between minus 1 and 1, what direction would the

96
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:40,140
characteristic go within that very very small range? So what you're going to see

97
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:45,560
in a physical solution is there is going to be a fan out there. There is

98
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:50,940
going to be a fan out there that comes from an infinitesimal small range of

99
00:05:50,940 --> 00:06:00,380
solutions. Okay, so that's why when you look at a solution later on, you will no

100
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:08,080
longer see an inverse shock lying over there, the solution should become like

101
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:16,900
that after a while. Does it make sense? So if you, if you cut the solution over here,

102
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,880
the solution over here is still minus 1, the solution here is still plus 1,

103
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:20,900
okay? So if you cut this both over here, the solution over here is still minus 1,

104
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:20,920
So if you cut this both over here, the solution over here is still minus 1,

105
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:26,380
But in between, there is going to be a wider and wider range of solutions that lies in between 0 and 1.

106
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,640
So this slope is going to be shallower and shallower.

107
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:37,400
Numerically, we are not going to capture that with the upwind scheme.

108
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,040
We just code it up.

109
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:46,100
But the fix is not very difficult.

110
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,360
Do you all understand what the problem is here?

111
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:55,860
What is the problem we are dealing with here?

112
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:03,320
So the solution to this is to always compute a numerical flux that is physical.

113
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,660
And by physical here, there is a way to look at the entropy of the solution here.

114
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,820
So even if you have an infinitesimal amount of viscosity, the entropy should not decrease.

115
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,700
It should increase.

116
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,700
Well, if you have a solution that is unique.

117
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,280
If you have an inverse shock, the entropy actually would decrease.

118
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:28,300
So let me say what is the non-physical solution.

119
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,500
Non-physical solution is you have an inverse shock sitting over here.

120
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:36,300
And the characteristics emerges out of the discontinuity.

121
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:43,340
So the entropy condition says that whenever you have a discontinuity,

122
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:50,720
for example, this one, characteristics can disappear.

123
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:56,160
And when things disappear, it's an increase of entropy.

124
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:02,980
But you cannot have any new information coming out of nowhere, coming out of a discontinuity, for example.

125
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:09,460
So you should not have any new characteristics emerging out of a discontinuity.

126
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:15,200
Okay, so things can dissipate, can disappear, but it cannot come out of nowhere.

127
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:20,880
So that's the so-called entropy condition we need to satisfy.

128
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:25,300
When we are using a numerical method to solve the differential equation.

129
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:33,060
Okay, so this is not allowed.

130
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,040
And this is okay.
