1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,280
Let's see another equation.

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,460
Let's say we want to solve the Helmholtz equation.

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:08,340
This is the equation we want to solve.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:15,040
So what we do next is, OK, what's the boundary condition, and then what is the template?

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,400
Now this is the template.

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,040
Now we just compare, OK?

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:22,000
We're trying to fit this template with the other equation.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,780
What do we have?

9
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,680
We don't have all of those terms, right?

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:33,120
And all we have now is C is equal to the same thing.

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:44,140
And then K, the wave number, we have that in the absorption term.

12
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,420
But that's it.

13
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:52,340
But these are now C and A and F are the only terms that we have.

14
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:57,180
Now all these things in the template are just...

15
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:57,680
OK.

16
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,240
So this is standing for some value, but for you, depending on the physics you are trying

17
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,740
to solve, they could mean one thing or another.

18
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:11,300
So this C, for example, for chemical problems, it's concentration.

19
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,540
For heat transfer problem, I mean, it's diffusion coefficient.

20
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:19,720
For heat transfer problems, it's convection coefficient.

21
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:27,120
If you were solving a one-dimensional elasticity stress analysis problem, that's the same thing.

22
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:32,620
So this is a two-dimensional elasticity stress analysis problem.

23
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:35,440
That would be your Young's modulus.

24
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,500
They can stand for different things.

25
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:44,660
But still you just find it and fill the template.

26
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:47,640
So it's really something like this, right?

27
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,960
You have things you want to fit in into a template and you're like, oh, where do I fit

28
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,620
in this?

29
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,240
Put this here.

30
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,280
Put this here.

31
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,840
like it might not fit.

32
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,060
So how can now we do this?

33
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,900
Yeah, so for example, forget that we're working with

34
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,380
equations.

35
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:13,700
I just want to fit this circle and find them which are

36
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:18,820
upside-down rectangular into those open areas.

37
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,260
You need to cut, exactly.

38
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,800
So you need to cut.

39
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,920
So this is for the cutting.

40
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,320
So you need to cut.

41
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,360
This will fit in.

42
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,700
But the other ones, you need to cut them and modify them.

43
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:37,280
So let's see an equation where we have to do this.

44
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,900
We want to do, let's say, Voxel's equation for finance.

45
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,280
Now, this is the equation that we want to solve.

46
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,720
Then we will compare it with a template.

47
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,840
And this is the template that we have.

48
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,840
Now, we can easily see that we don't have those terms.

49
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,920
We don't have the math terms.

50
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,000
We don't have a source term.

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,440
dA is 1.

52
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:07,500
Now, what is the problem with using C is equal to half sigma

53
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,260
squared x squared?

54
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:15,120
So C looks like it could be half sigma squared x squared,

55
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,540
right?

56
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,540
Beneficial for that.

57
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:23,900
For x, right?

58
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,360
They're going to have a . . .

59
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:29,520
So what's the derivative with respect to x out of sigma squared x squared?

60
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,440
Because it's going to be inside the divergence.

61
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,540
So when that happens, what can I do?

62
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,600
OK, I'm going to do this.

63
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,000
But then, since I have this extra derivative, I will move it, right?

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:50,000
This term, sigma squared x, that comes out of this term here, next to last.

65
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,060
That comes out of the .

66
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,000
I will just move it and try to fit it somewhere else.

67
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So I'm going to move it.

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,500
I'm going to move it.

69
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,920
I'm going to move it.

70
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,920
I'm going to move it.

71
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,920
And balance it so that the end of the rate is the same.

72
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,920
I convert it to a form that I understand, and it's the same format.

73
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,600
Then there are more than one ways to do this.

74
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:11,040
I could have put it there, or I could also have moved it to the source term.

75
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:20,320
But in any case, it is in a format that at first doesn't look like x squared.

76
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,720
Just try to convert it into a familiar form and fit that.

77
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,720
OK.

78
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,920
Is that clear?

79
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,920
Is that clear?

80
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,920
So there was this .

81
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:32,920
I don't know if you guys heard about this, but there was this mathematician who lost

82
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,920
his job.

83
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,920
And he goes to the fire department to get a job.

84
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,920
And he had an interview.

85
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:46,920
And the first question was, assume you are working in a certain neighborhood and one

86
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,920
house is on fire.

87
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,920
What do you do?

88
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,920
And he says, OK, I'm going to call 911.

89
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,920
And until I get that number, I'm going to call 911.

90
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,920
And I'm going to tell 911.

91
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:58,920
And until I get help, I'm going to find a hydrant and do what I can do in the meantime.

92
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,920
And I'm like, okay, that's a very good answer.

93
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,920
Second question.

94
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,920
You are working in a neighborhood.

95
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,920
Everything is fine, no problem.

96
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,920
What do you do?

97
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,920
First, I put one house on fire.

98
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,920
After that, it's a social problem, right?

99
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,920
You know how to handle that question.

100
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,920
So a lot of times in mathematical modeling, when things look strange,

101
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:26,920
the first thing is can I rewrite this in a form that is familiar?

102
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,920
Then I know how to handle it.

103
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,920
So that's how these templates work.

104
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:39,920
So when you are working with this, then you need to sometimes access the derivatives of certain quantities.

105
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,920
So here are some operators in console to give you derivatives.

106
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,920
If the solution field was u, for example,

107
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,920
then ux, uy, uz will give you special derivatives.

108
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,920
And then you can add them.

109
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:58,920
It will give you a second derivative, mixed derivative.

110
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:09,920
If you are on surfaces, we have this solution field uppercase T special direction variable,

111
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,920
which will give you a tangential derivative on boundaries.

112
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:19,920
Now, that only works if you are differentiating the solution field.

113
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,920
But other times,

114
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,920
you want to differentiate other quantities.

115
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,920
For example, this would mean that for a heat transfer problem,

116
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,920
these operators will work if you are differentiating temperature.

117
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,920
But if you are trying to differentiate flux or another quantity, they don't work.

118
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:38,920
But the operators which work irrespective of the quantity you are using

119
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:45,920
are this d, quantity, comma, what you are differentiating it against with operators.

120
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,920
So those give you partial derivatives of any quantity with respect to x, y, z.

121
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:54,920
Or r of z in a cis-emitter component.

122
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,920
And time.

123
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,920
In the reference manual, you can find more differentiation operators.

124
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,920
So you will use this operator sometimes when you need access to the derivatives.

125
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,920
Yes?

126
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,920
Can we get normal derivatives the same way?

127
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,920
Is that going to happen or something?

128
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,920
I have to check.

129
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,920
I don't think it's available.

130
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,920
Yeah.

131
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:30,920
Because mostly the way you can do is,

132
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,920
the way I evaluate normal derivatives is,

133
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,920
the derivative itself is available.

134
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:41,920
And the unit outward normal on boundaries is also available.

135
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,920
So you can take a dope product.

136
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,920
Yeah.

137
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,920
But the tangential derivatives are important because a lot of times,

138
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:55,920
you might want to, if you have a surface, some equation only valid on the surface.

139
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:00,920
If you have surface chemistry, for example, you might want to have access to the tangential derivatives.

140
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:06,920
But yeah, you get the derivative and you can dot multiply them with a unit outward normal.

141
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,920
Other questions?

142
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,920
Is it clear so far?
