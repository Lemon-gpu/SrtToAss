1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,080
So everybody should see a screen like that right now, right? So you can look

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:12,840
at the project description here. So solve the differential equation partial t

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,960
partial time equal to a times partial square t partial x square plus a right

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,560
hand side. So that's basically our project while we're removing one of the

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:34,140
terms. And use a, b, and c as specified also tc is here. Initial condition is t

6
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:41,100
equal to 325 for all x. Boundary condition is t at times at x equal to 0

7
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:46,800
is equal to the same 325 and the right hand side is going to be a

8
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,900
Newman boundary condition. The derivative is equal to 10.

9
00:00:52,560 --> 00:01:00,600
And given the solution at t equal to 300 start by writing a function mini

10
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:07,260
project 1 where n is the number of grid points which include x equal to 0 and x

11
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:18,300
equal to 1 and t is the final time at which the solution is sought. All right.

12
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,520
So here we are supposed to write a

13
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:22,540
solution. So we are supposed to write a solution. So we are supposed to write a

14
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,300
function.

15
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:38,380
function result is equal to mini project 1, n is the number of grid points

16
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:48,880
and what is 300. Oh and t, t is the time. So you are going to code up a functions

17
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,500
basically assign result to t.

18
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,460
And then you are going to write a function. So you are going to write a
