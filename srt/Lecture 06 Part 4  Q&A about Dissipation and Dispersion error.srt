1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,440
if you do Fourier series analysis to a fourth order derivative right you are

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:14,520
taking ik to the fourth power what is that like

3
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:33,900
so the first order derivative to Fourier series analysis you get a purely imaginary eigenvalue

4
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:41,760
that that means oscillations preserving the magnitude right second order derivative you

5
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,100
get minus k square that means decay

6
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:52,380
third order derivative you get still purely imaginary but you have k cubed so it advects

7
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:59,160
it different frequencies oscillates more differently and in in terms of advection that means different

8
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,200
frequencies are advected at different speeds

9
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:10,680
fourth order derivative you get k to the fourth and usually the sign unless you have an unstable

10
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,900
scheme the sign over that k to the fourth

11
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:14,500
the

12
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,640
the error term should have a negative sign otherwise you should have you're going to

13
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,380
get unstable scheme alright if you have a stable

14
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:28,160
scheme you should have minus k to the fourth as you eigenvalue

15
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:37,200
what is that what does that dissipation that's right and it dissipates your higher

16
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:44,500
frequency even faster than than k square okay but the good thing is that term is you should

17
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:52,660
scales with Delta X cubed. So with enough grid you only see the effect of that

18
00:01:52,660 --> 00:02:00,220
dissipation on very high weight numbers. That's why it's more accurate.

19
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,220
Yes?

20
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:16,360
If we try upwinding on this unit instead of trying it on the bump, would we have dissipation

21
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,540
for higher terms which are at the corners of that shape?

22
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:28,220
Are you asking if I use the first order upwinding on this one, what do I get? Let's try it.

23
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,220
Okay.

24
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,220
Okay.

25
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:47,720
Let's do K because it looks more obvious. That. So the height, yeah, basically dissipates

26
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:52,720
things away. All right. Yes?

27
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,220
But all those terms, they're still going to be the third order and also in this

28
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,220
scheme as well.

29
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,220
It's just far less pronounced.

30
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,220
Yeah.

31
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,820
The middle one is againол

32
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,720
Yeah.

33
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:18,540
I'm going to measure something else, and then

34
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:23,220
you can hedge in some ways depending on you're...

35
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,220
Okay.

36
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,300
So let's...

37
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,220
Yeah, see what I'm trying to do here, which is the fifth-placeかった-type fraternal

38
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,220
Disseduction.

39
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,220
It's fine, affecting the rest of the paid.

40
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,220
when you have higher wave numbers.

41
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:36,220
So you almost don't see that in the black solution.

42
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,220
So if you really, really zoom in,

43
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,220
the black solution is not going to be symmetric.

44
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,220
All right, it has slight asymmetry,

45
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:47,220
but it's very hard to spot.

46
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,220
If you have an analytical solution

47
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,220
of a black-trim dissipation equation,

48
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:57,220
the black wave should be completely symmetric.

49
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:01,220
All right, any other questions?

50
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:15,220
Are there formulations that avoid all of these errors?

51
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,220
It'll be ideal if you can find the scheme

52
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:31,220
that avoids any kind of errors.

53
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:37,220
But like, unless for very simple equations,

54
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,220
there is going to be numerical errors.

55
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,220
And the dissipation and dispersion error

56
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,220
is just a way we classify different types of errors.

57
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,220
So dissipation error,

58
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:53,220
both acts a lot stronger on higher wave numbers.

59
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,220
It's just dissipation error,

60
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,220
but the error artificially damps down,

61
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,220
removes these higher wave number components.

62
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,220
And dispersion error,

63
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,220
it doesn't remove them,

64
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,220
but put them in the wrong place.

65
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,220
So that's kind of, in general,

66
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:17,220
how we classify the effect of these numerical errors.

67
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,220
Yes?

68
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,220
If you switch back to the analytic derivation,

69
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,220
I had a question about what happened

70
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,220
to one of the terms.

71
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,220
Yes?

72
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,220
Can you scroll up slightly,

73
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,220
going from...

74
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,220
Oh, okay.

75
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,220
Sorry, I misread the notes.

76
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,220
Thank you.

77
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,220
Okay.

78
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,220
Any other questions?

79
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,220
No?

80
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,220
All right.
