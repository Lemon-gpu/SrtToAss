1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,500
Remember elliptic equations is almost like a special case for the heat equation, x squared,

2
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:22,000
except for two differences.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:31,000
One difference is that I'm going to add f of x onto the right hand side.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,080
The other difference is I'm going to make this term equal to zero, which makes it equilibrium.

5
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,880
So I'm going to make it equal to zero.

6
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:49,200
We already discussed how to discretize this term, and do we know how do we add a function

7
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,760
of x onto the discretization?

8
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:51,880
Okay.

9
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:51,960
Okay.

10
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:51,980
Okay.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,100
Okay.

12
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:52,160
Okay.

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:52,220
Okay.

14
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:52,240
Okay.

15
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:52,300
Okay.

16
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:52,340
Okay.

17
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:52,420
Okay.

18
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:52,440
Okay.

19
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:52,460
Okay.

20
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:52,580
Okay.

21
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:52,640
Okay.

22
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:52,960
Okay.

23
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:52,980
Okay.

24
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:53,040
Okay.

25
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:53,080
Okay.

26
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:53,500
Okay.

27
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:53,880
Okay.

28
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,020
Okay.

29
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:54,140
Okay.

30
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:54,200
Okay.

31
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:54,340
Okay.

32
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,960
So we already discussed this term.

33
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:04,780
If the left hand side is equal to zero, we get a vector of zeros, which replaces d u d t,

34
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:15,280
d vector u d t, equal to a matrix, let me just call it a, times the same vector u.

35
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,340
So u1, et cetera, to u n minus one.

36
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,880
And if we have boundary conditions, we're going to say that we're going to have a vector

37
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:21,980
u 1, et cetera, to u n minus one.

38
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:32,680
going to be adding, we are going to be adding let's say a b1 0 and b n minus 1.

39
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:42,680
Right? So how do we add this f of x onto this equation? Yeah?

40
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,680
It's just a vector with the sampling point of f.

41
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:56,680
Exactly. It's just a vector of the samples of f at delta x, 2 delta x, 3 delta x, etc.

42
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,680
So we are going to be discretizing f using the same way.

43
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,680
f is defined as f at i delta x.

44
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:16,680
So now this, instead of an ODE, what we get?

45
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,680
We get a linear equation.

46
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,680
Right?

47
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,680
Ax plus, if you call this just a vector c,

48
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,680
ax plus au plus c equal to 0.

49
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,680
In MATLAB, how do you solve it?

50
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,680
Backslash.

51
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,680
Backslash, right.

52
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:42,680
So for example, in MATLAB, before I used a lot of, I used ODE45,

53
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,680
it went through thousands of time steps to solve this equation.

54
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,680
Right?

55
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:54,680
But instead, I can just solve the same equation using what?

56
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:00,680
u equal to a backslash b, actually minus b.

57
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,680
Right?

58
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,680
Because I want to solve au plus b equal to 0.

59
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,680
Here I don't have any right hand side.

60
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,680
Okay?

61
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,680
If I close all.

62
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,680
If I plot u, I get the same thing.

63
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,680
I get the same thing.

64
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,680
All right?

65
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,680
So that's how we solve elliptic equations.

66
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,680
Question?

67
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,680
Yeah, but only in the case that you're interested in the final steady state.

68
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,680
Only when I'm interested in the final steady state.

69
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,680
Exactly.

70
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,680
Exactly.

71
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,680
So that's what characterizes elliptic equations.

72
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,680
I'll tell you a little bit, like, what's the difference between hyperbolic and elliptic,

73
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,680
sorry, parabolic and elliptic equations.

74
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,680
So, so when you don't have any time derivative,

75
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,680
you can solve the equation by backslash.

76
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:54,680
And if I define some right hand side, let's say I have an f that is equal to 1,

77
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,680
n minus 1, 1.

78
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,680
So I have a right hand side f is equal to constant 1.

79
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:07,680
What I'm going to be solving is au plus b plus f equal to 0,

80
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,680
which makes minus b minus f,

81
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,680
which is the same as the time derivative.

82
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,680
So I can solve the equation.

83
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,680
I get plus b minus f to be the appropriate right hand side.

84
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,680
If I plot you again,

85
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,680
here's what I get.

86
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,680
We get a slight curvature.

87
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,680
Get a slight curvature.

88
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:39,680
Is that what we should have?

89
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,680
I think...

90
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,680
Sor the second derivative plus one

91
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,540
equal to zero which makes the second order derivative to be negative right

92
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:56,400
which makes the line go that way all right so that's what we should get and

93
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:06,480
if you increase F by a hundred you get something a lot more curvy so that's

94
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:13,560
that's solving elliptic equations and the difference between elliptic

95
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:23,940
equations and parabolic equations so remember what we had is the domain of

96
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:29,340
dependence so I'm not going to be talking about the meaning of elliptic

97
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:36,900
and parabolic because it relates to some analytical partial differential equation

98
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:42,800
theory but I'm just going to tell you in terms of behavior how do they behave

99
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,320
differently

100
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:51,360
so elliptic equation works in space and time that's the physical interpretation

101
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,800
of it in mathematics mathematicians may not care about the difference between

102
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,500
space and time right because for them they are basically independent variables

103
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:06,960
of a function but when we talk about difference in different types of

104
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:13,480
equations we can think of for parabolic equations there is one special coordinate

105
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,760
we can just call it time and that special coordinate has such a feature

106
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:23,380
that if you introduced a perturbation to the differential equation to the

107
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:29,600
solution either to the solution or to the differential equation itself at a

108
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:35,880
particular space in time that perturbation is going to change the

109
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:43,560
solution not before that particular time but after that particular time right and

110
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,720
Basically that makes sense if you solve the heat equation for example. If you add

111
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,360
heat at a particular point in space at a particular point in time, the solution,

112
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,560
the temperature field is going to be changed not before you add that heat but

113
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,620
after you add that heat. And because heat, according to heat equation, it diffuses

114
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:11,640
instantaneously. There is no speed of diffusion for heat. The solution is going

115
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:18,000
to be changed immediately after the time you add the heat. The change is

116
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,840
going to be very very small, far away from the heat source, very recent after

117
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,360
the addition, but it'll be different. So parabolic equation means that there

118
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,520
exists such a special coordinate, a special independent variable for which

119
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:41,620
that it behaves like time. If you put up the equation at a particular point in

120
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:48,240
time, the solution later is going to be different. Elliptic equation does not

121
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:55,180
have that special coordinate, so that's why we usually call it x. Instead of t we

122
00:07:55,180 --> 00:08:02,800
call it y, think of just that two spatial dimensions. And, for example, the more

123
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,740
general case of this is, we also have two spatial dimensions, facelift atizza

124
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,580
arson. The second load derivative in X and second

125
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:11,620
low- issue in two over R. and n один dados. And now it's two morequin dive in f.

126
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:17,920
the derivative in y. That equation does not have neither x nor y is a special

127
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:25,060
coordinate. If you change, if you put a change in the in the equation, let's say

128
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:31,960
plus, if you change the f at a particular x and y, the solution is not only going

129
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,880
to be different after a particular y, but it's going to be different everywhere.

130
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:42,120
It's going to change globally. So elliptic equations are the ones without that

131
00:08:42,120 --> 00:09:03,400
special time-like coordinate. Yeah, this is parabolic, this is elliptic. All right.

132
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,860
So if you think physically, it's

133
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:10,440
pretty easy to distinguish an elliptic equation. It's one basically without time,

134
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,500
a steady-state type of solution.
