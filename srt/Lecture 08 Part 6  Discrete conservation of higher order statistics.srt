1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Sounds great. Let's solve it a little bit more.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Solve it for 0.5.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Plot it again.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Ah, something bad is happening, huh?

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So let's take a look at the last solution.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
bar at u at the end.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
No.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Okay, u end and the column.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Yes. So this is my solution.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So I do see I get something similar to what I'm supposed to get, right?

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So as things run into the shock wave, this part further flattens and I get a shock wave over here.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
But what about this?

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I have artificially generated oscillations.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Right. So why is that the case?

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So let's analyze the central flux scheme.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
A little bit more.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So first of all, one obvious thing we see is that

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
it doesn't seem to be conserving or decreasing the

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
what's called the total variation, right?

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So we have the total variation. We see it is diminishing all the time.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
But over this region, when these oscillations are created,

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
you get a lot of total variation.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Out of nothing, right?

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So this is a problem we need to address.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And this is a particular problem about the central flux scheme.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And the reason for that is we can do a different analysis

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
about the central flux scheme

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,000
where the du bar dt

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
is equal to 1 over delta x.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
times f that's basically

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
half of f plus f plus 1 minus

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:22,000
oh, this is f plus f minus 1, right?

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
minus half of f plus f plus 1.

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So this f gets cancelled with this f here.

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So we have 1 over delta x.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Actually, 1 over 2 delta x.

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
f minus 1 minus f plus 1.

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And we're going to find the central difference scheme

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
both in finite difference and in finite volume.

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
They conserve a certain high order statistics.

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Let me tell you what that means in a moment.

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And f is equal to

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
the Burgers flux evaluated at u bar i.

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So f is equal to

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
the Burgers flux evaluated at

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
u bar of i minus 1 square

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
minus u bar i plus 1 square.

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Right?

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So this is the

50
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
after all the substitution of the Burgers equation

51
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
and the central flux,

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
what we get.

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Alright?

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So,

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
a trick I'm going to do is

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm going to multiply

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
both sides of the equation by

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
u i bar square.

59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So the left hand side is

60
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
u i bar square times d u i bar d t.

61
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The right hand side of the equation is

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
1 over 2 delta x

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
half of u bar i minus 1 square

64
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
u bar i square.

65
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Right?

66
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Because I multiplied u bar i square on both sides.

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Minus u bar i square

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
u bar i plus 1 square.

69
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
A little bit interesting,

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
but let's make it a little bit more obvious.

71
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So the left hand side is d d t,

72
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
a third of d d t.

73
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
u bar cube i d t.

74
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The right hand side is

75
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
the difference between

76
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
u i minus 1

77
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
u i 4 delta x

78
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
minus u i square

79
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
u i plus 1 square

80
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
over 4 delta x.

81
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Okay.

82
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So,

83
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
this number is exactly

84
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
this number with index i

85
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
shifted by 1.

86
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Which means

87
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
if I sum up

88
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
the left hand side

89
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
over a range of i's,

90
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
if I take the d d t

91
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
of a summation of i

92
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
goes from i 0 to i 1

93
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
of u i cube over 3,

94
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
this is going to

95
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
equal to only two numbers.

96
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
All the interiors get cancelled.

97
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
This is only

98
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
would it be equal to

99
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
u of i 0 minus 1 u i 0

100
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
bar square bar square over 4 delta x

101
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
minus u i 1 square bar

102
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
u i 1 plus 1 square bar 4 delta x.

103
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
We don't get any summation

104
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
on the right hand side

105
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
because all the interiors

106
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
once gets cancelled.

107
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Okay.

108
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So,

109
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
if you look at here,

110
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I have to do,

111
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I have to multiply

112
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
by this u i square

113
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
because otherwise

114
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
if I multiply by u i,

115
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
for example,

116
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I wouldn't get any cancellation

117
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
on the right hand side.

118
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
The u i bar cube

119
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
satisfy a certain conservation law

120
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
discreetly.

121
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Right.

122
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So,

123
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
which means

124
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
if you look at a large range,

125
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
if you look at a large range of i's,

126
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
if you look at a range of spatial indices,

127
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
the total amount of u cubed

128
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
over these indices

129
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
stays conserved.

130
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
The time derivative is

131
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
only equal to what goes in.

132
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's equal to a certain flux

133
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
that goes in from the left of the domain

134
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
minus a certain flux that

135
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
goes out on the right of the domain.

136
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
That is a problem

137
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
because

138
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
it does not allow

139
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
the solution to diminish.

140
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Remember if we have,

141
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
for example,

142
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
a simplest way to analyze this

143
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
is in a periodic domain

144
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
where we don't have any boundaries.

145
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So,

146
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
if I have periodic domain

147
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
and if the summation over all,

148
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
over all indices,

149
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
then I can find out

150
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
the time derivative

151
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
of u i,

152
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
bar cubed over three

153
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
is equal to zero

154
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
because all these things cancel

155
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
over a periodic domain.

156
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So, I have exact conservation of

157
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
u i cubed summed over the entire domain.

158
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And that simply does not allow my solution

159
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
to become zero as it should

160
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
when I have a Berger's equation,

161
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
when I have everything runs into a shockwave.

162
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
We can run this further, right?

163
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So, we already have something running to the shockwave.

164
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
This thing should diminish.

165
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
The shockwave should become zero.

166
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's smaller and smaller.

167
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
But if we run it further and further,

168
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
we can see that it would never diminish

169
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
because the cube is conserved.

170
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So, let's run over five.

171
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Ah, failure.

172
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Okay.

173
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
The discrete has probably become very bad.

174
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Plot this.

175
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Right.

176
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
So, we get wilder and wilder oscillations

177
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
because the equation has to conserve

178
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
the total amount of u cubed.

179
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
All right.

180
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
So, it doesn't allow the solution

181
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
to become a nice form like this,

182
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
which it should be.

183
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Right. So, what we get is...

184
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Ah...

185
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
What we get is...

186
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So, while what we should get is this

187
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
after a while.

188
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So, starting from the initial state,

189
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
starting from the initial condition,

190
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
