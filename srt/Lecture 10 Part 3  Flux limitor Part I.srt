1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,120
So we have two cell averages here, we have two cell averages over here, we want

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,500
to reconstruct the solution here and the reconstruction cannot be linear.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:20,280
So u of i plus half left is equal to a nonlinear function, has to be

4
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:27,520
equal to a nonlinear function of ui and ui minus 1. And u of i plus half right

5
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:35,760
has to be a nonlinear function of ui plus 1 and ui plus 2. So the question

6
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:43,200
here is how do we achieve that nonlinearity? What kind of nonlinearity

7
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:50,880
is it required. And through this process we can also see an aspect of the order

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,300
barrier theorem, why we need a nonlinear scheme.

9
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,360
So let's start with a nonlinear scheme.

10
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:57,500
So let's start with a nonlinear scheme.

11
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:09,820
start to look at several cases, several very representative cases of how we want to reconstruct.

12
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:22,720
So this is U, this is Ui, this is Ui plus 1, and this is Ui plus 2, and this is a case

13
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,280
where the solution is very smooth locally.

14
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,220
The solution increases almost in a linear fashion.

15
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:36,820
This is when you represent the, if you compute the cell averages of a linear function, this

16
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,080
is what you're going to get.

17
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:50,500
So in this case, this special case 1 is Ui minus Ui minus 1 is equal to Ui plus 1 minus

18
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:56,060
Ui is equal to Ui plus 2 minus Ui plus 1.

19
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,160
So this is a special case.

20
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,100
We are considering.

21
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:10,560
In this case, second order accuracy means that when we perform a reconstruction of the

22
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:20,240
solution, if we reconstruct the solution of a linear equation, to get second order accuracy,

23
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:25,520
we need an exact reconstruction.

24
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,120
So first order accuracy means.

25
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,720
If we reconstruct a constant function, we should get the exact reconstruction.

26
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,680
And second order accuracy means if we reconstruct a linear function.

27
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,880
Doing Taylor series analysis, linear function has the second order derivative, third order

28
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,860
derivative, everything else is equal to zero.

29
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:54,740
So if we want a second order accurate reconstruction, we need to have exactly, I want my U at i plus

30
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,940
half left over.

31
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,000
Right?

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,840
All right.

33
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:04,360
Both equal to Ui plus Ui plus 1 over 2.

34
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,560
So that's my first case.

35
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,520
All right.

36
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:19,520
The second case is a completely different scenario.

37
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:25,820
This is a scenario where my Ui is a local maximum.

38
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:46,140
When this is a local maximum, can somebody tell me what should the value of Ui plus half

39
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,400
left?

40
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,880
What is the constraint on this value?

41
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,000
Can the value be a half?

42
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yes.

43
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Okay.

44
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
All right.

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,500
So the value of Ui plus half is higher than Ui itself.

46
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:08,100
If we want to preserve monotonicity of the total variation.

47
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:16,120
Remember that monotonicity of total variation is not creating new extremers.

48
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:21,020
If you create a new extremer, if you push the maximum, if you push the local maximum

49
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:25,440
of the function above Ui, which is the current local maximum.

50
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,440
Okay.

51
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,440
Now we are increasing the total variation.

52
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,440
Right?

53
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,440
Yes?

54
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,440
It should be the value of Ui?

55
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,440
Yes.

56
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,140
So in this case, the reconstructed value should actually be the value of Ui.

57
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,140
All right.

58
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,140
Okay.

59
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:45,040
So here we start to get a sense of why this value is greater than the value of Ui.

60
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,040
Right?

61
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,040
Yeah.

62
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,440
So you can see that the value of Ui is greater than the value of Ui.

63
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,440
Okay.

64
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,440
So in this case, the value of Ui is greater than the value of Ui.

65
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,440
Right?

66
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,440
So why the reconstruction cannot be linear?

67
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:09,840
Because in the first case, in case one, in order to get this value and in order to represent

68
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:17,560
this value, in order to represent Ui, let me use blue to distinguish the two cases,

69
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:24,440
in order to get Ui plus R half at left, only as a function of Ui and Ui minus one.

70
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:32,440
How can we perform that representation?

71
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:37,440
Remember here interpolation in the linear function is the same as extrapolation.

72
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,440
Right?

73
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:52,840
So we can use Ui minus half of Ui minus Ui minus one.

74
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,840
Okay.

75
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,840
So here let me rewrite it a little bit.

76
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,840
So if I divide this by delta x, that's the slope.

77
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:08,840
And if I multiply that by delta x over two, it is saying that I am computing the slope

78
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,840
using Ui and Ui minus one here.

79
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:18,840
And I'm applying the same slope over this range, which is delta x.

80
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,840
I think it's plus.

81
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,840
Sorry.

82
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,840
Right?

83
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,840
So this is the slope.

84
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,840
And delta x over two is this range.

85
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,840
So the width here is delta x over two.

86
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:49,840
So this is the slope times the x distance, which gets me this.

87
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,840
And if I add that to Ui, that's exactly this.

88
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,840
Add that to Ui, that's exactly the value at the interface.

89
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,840
Does it make sense?

90
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:05,840
So here we are constructing, reconstructing a solution using Ui minus one.

91
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:11,840
If Ui minus one increases or decreases, the value here is going to change.

92
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:18,840
While in the other case, when the function is not smooth, when the function achieves a local extrema,

93
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,840
the reconstructed value should not depend on Ui plus one.

94
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,840
Yes, we are trying to reconstruct the value of U at the interfaces and left and right

95
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:35,840
interfaces, so that we can apply the Godanoff scheme to compute the flux at the interface.

96
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:42,840
So once we can have U left and U right at the interface, applying what we studied in

97
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,840
the last lecture is going to give us a numerical flux.

98
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,840
So what we have is the following.

99
00:07:50,840 --> 00:08:00,840
In the first case, when the solution is locally smooth, we have Ui plus an influence from the next cell.

100
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:07,840
In the other case, when the solution is not smooth, we have just the Ui without influence from the last cell.

101
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:15,840
So we can write that, we can write the second case as plus the same slope.

102
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,840
So this is, all right, exactly what I can write.

103
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:27,840
Voltage, delta x times 0, right, and this is like times 1, right.

104
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:35,840
So this 1 or 0 is like turning on and off a slope indicator.

105
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,840
That's something we call a limiter, right.

106
00:08:45,840 --> 00:09:05,360
0 or 1, right? And this phi is equal to 1 for smooth solution and 0 for local

107
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:18,500
extremer. So how do we construct this phi? So phi is going to be a sensor of whether

108
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:31,340
the solution is locally smooth or not. So phi depends on what? The best way to sense

109
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:34,740
whether this is a local extremer or locally smooth.

110
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:44,320
Is the ratio between this and this. If the ratio, in this case, the ratio is equal to

111
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:52,500
1. When the ratio is equal to 1, we know it's locally a very linear function. In the other

112
00:09:52,500 --> 00:10:03,760
case, the ratio is what? It's negative, right? So again, depends on the ratio, let me call

113
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,240
R.

114
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:18,900
R being Ui plus 1 minus Ui divided by Ui minus Ui minus 1. So again, this is equal to 1 if

115
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:26,520
R is equal to 1. And for local extremers, either minimal or maximum, R is going to be

116
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:34,200
less than 0. Okay. So the flux limiter.

117
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:42,240
The flux limiter is this phi of R. And let's figure out what are the conditions that this

118
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:50,440
phi of R has to satisfy in order for us to have a second order monotonic scheme. Yes?

119
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,420
Which one should be Ui minus 1 here?

120
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:56,520
The first term before that.

121
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,520
Here?

122
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,520
Yeah.

123
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:02,240
Here should be Ui because this value is Ui, right? Let me use this.

124
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,240
Okay.

125
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,240
Okay.

126
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:11,740
So this is the black color here. This value is Ui, right? And the distance between Ui

127
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:23,360
and this appropriate reconstruction is delta x over 2 times the slope. Right? So this value

128
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:31,240
is Ui plus the slope times delta x over 2. Right? Yes?

129
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,240
So for this V?

130
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,240
Yeah.

131
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:40,040
So for this V function, like it's not all inclusive. Like should it just be R greater

132
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,800
than 0 for smooth solution?

133
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:51,120
So we have a proposal that should phi of R be greater than 0 for smooth solutions?

134
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:58,240
Or sorry, phi of R equal to 1 for all R greater than 0? Is that what you are proposing?

135
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,240
Yes.

136
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,240
Okay. So we have a proposal that phi looks like that.

137
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,240
Okay.

138
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:14,560
So we have a proposal that phi has a function of R. So this is 0, this is 1. We have a proposal

139
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,560
that is 0 here and 1 here.

140
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:29,000
Okay. We'll take a look at if the proposal works. All right? Okay. So let's figure out

141
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,680
the appropriate...

142
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,740
Let's first figure out if this part of the proposal is equal to 0.

143
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,740
Okay.

144
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,980
So we have the part of the proposal works. Yes?

145
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:41,980
In the green figure, the cell to the left is it equal to Ui plus 1 as well?

146
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:46,120
Oh, sorry. The left should be Ui minus 1. Yeah.

147
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,640
So they don't have to be...

148
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:56,400
They don't have to be equal. Yeah. They only need to be both smaller than Ui. Okay. So

149
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,740
let's first figure out the left side of this proposal works. The proposal is phi should

150
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,740
be just equal to 0 when I have this part of the data.

151
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,740
Okay.

152
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,600
whenever r is less than zero.

153
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:10,520
Does that give us the desired solution

154
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,060
whenever we have a local extrema?

155
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,860
Yes, right?

156
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,980
Whenever we have a local extrema,

157
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:22,480
we want a piecewise constant reconstruction

158
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:28,220
because any slope is going to give us new extremas.

159
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,940
Any non-zero slope is going to make

160
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,920
the reconstructed solution go higher or lower

161
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,640
than the existing extrema.

162
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,620
So this part of the proposal is correct.

163
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,040
So phi of r should be exactly equal to zero

164
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,600
whenever r is less than zero.

165
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,620
Okay, let's then figure out

166
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,300
if the positive part of this proposal works.
