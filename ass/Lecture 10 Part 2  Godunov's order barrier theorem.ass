Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:08.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the same person, Godunov, who has proposed the way to reconstruct the flux at interfaces,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:09.320,00:00:11.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,proved an impossibility theorem.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:12.960,00:00:21.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,He proved that it is impossible to construct a scheme that is monotonic.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:21.360,00:00:30.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,So monotonicity means the total variation is less or equal to zero,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:30.640,00:00:35.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,which means the monotonicity of total variation over time.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:36.020,00:00:41.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the total variation has to be monotonically non-increasing over time.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:42.060,00:00:43.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's what it means.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:44.700,00:00:49.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,And his theorem works for even the simplest conservation laws,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:49.720,00:00:50.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,that is, the linear.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:51.360,00:00:54.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,Linear advection equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:55.020,00:00:59.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,And he said a linear one-step second-order accurate numerical scheme,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:00.660,00:01:03.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,even for a linear equation, cannot be monotonic,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:03.780,00:01:06.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,cannot decrease total variation,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:07.520,00:01:11.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,unless the CFL number is integers,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:12.540,00:01:16.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,which can only be achieved everywhere
Dialogue: 0,00:01:18.020,00:01:21.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,if the C is a constant everywhere.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:21.360,00:01:34.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this condition is only feasible for constant C,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:34.360,00:01:37.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is linear equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:41.360,00:01:47.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,So an example for this is if this is exactly equal to one,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:47.360,00:01:49.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,so if sigma is equal to one,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:49.360,00:01:50.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,which means we are discriminating against the C,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:51.360,00:01:53.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,and there's a constant C.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:53.060,00:01:58.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well, from the
Dialogue: 0,00:01:58.080,00:01:58.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,region,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:58.840,00:02:01.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and here we are,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:01.860,00:02:07.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,we're perceiving x in ay cross x in divided by t,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:08.600,00:02:13.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we're嚕meo2 ay cross c is minus x.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:13.200,00:02:15.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,Here's a couple of case studies,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:15.700,00:02:17.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,to be Noah's example.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:17.940,00:02:19.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Wheep we're vezes x,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:19.320,00:02:19.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,next.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:19.740,00:02:20.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,Deputy.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:20.140,00:02:20.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Cream.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:20.440,00:02:20.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Gis.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:20.760,00:02:21.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,The distance.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:21.220,00:02:37.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if sigma is equal to 1, that means my delta t times c is exactly equal to delta x, which means this term is going to cancel with this term.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:37.760,00:02:50.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,What I get is phi of n plus 1i is exactly equal to, and this is exactly equal to phi of n at i minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:51.220,00:03:07.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in a space-time solution, so if this is t, this is x, I'm saying the grid points at the next time step is equal to the grid points here.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:07.760,00:03:13.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Which is completely reasonable because the characteristics are exactly aligned with the grid points.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:14.880,00:03:19.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the solution here is exactly equal to the solution here, and I get exact solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:21.220,00:03:27.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,But this is artificial because this scheme would only work for linear vector equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:29.580,00:03:37.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is, I can only set my delta t and delta x to be at a constant ratio.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:37.780,00:03:44.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,Set my CFL number to be a constant integer only when c is a constant, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:44.920,00:03:51.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is, these are special cases that I can get second-order accurate numeric.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:51.560,00:03:59.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I can only get the same number of numerical schemes that wouldn't work for nonlinear conservation laws.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:59.920,00:04:03.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right, does that make sense?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:04.660,00:04:18.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, Goodanoff's order barrier theorem says that if you rely on the linear scheme for solving linear equations,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:18.920,00:04:20.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then you cannot get more than x.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:21.220,00:04:23.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you have to define first-order accuracy.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:23.220,00:04:31.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you also want to preserve the monotonicity of total variation.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:31.220,00:04:37.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it tells us that we must go to a nonlinear scheme.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:37.220,00:04:43.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, we must go to a nonlinear scheme even for solving linear equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:43.220,00:04:49.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,And a nonlinear scheme means if you add two solutions,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:49.220,00:04:51.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,You get a solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:51.220,00:04:59.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,You get a flux that is not equal to the summation of the flux getting from these two individual solutions.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:59.220,00:05:05.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,In a finite volume, that's what it means by a nonlinear scheme.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:05.220,00:05:10.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the Goodanoff's theorem says that if you want second-order accuracy,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:10.220,00:05:16.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,You can either sacrifice monotonicity, which creates Gibbs phenomenon,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:16.220,00:05:19.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or you have to go to a nonlinear scheme.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:21.220,00:05:31.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Only first-order schemes can have both monotonicity and linearity.
