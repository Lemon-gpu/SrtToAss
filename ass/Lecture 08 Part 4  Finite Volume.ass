Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.760,00:00:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So remember, the starting point of a scalar conservation law, discretizing a scalar conservation
Dialogue: 0,00:00:06.000,00:00:09.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,law is the what form?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:09.680,00:00:13.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is the integral form because this is the only form that makes sense.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:13.200,00:00:18.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,The only form that doesn't involve d dx of any discontinuous functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:18.680,00:00:19.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:19.680,00:00:25.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean, if you remember when we do finite difference, we are using Taylor series to
Dialogue: 0,00:00:25.520,00:00:29.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,analyze the accuracy of our discretization.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:29.780,00:00:36.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,And in the Taylor series, we, no matter how high order the scheme is, we have a remaining
Dialogue: 0,00:00:36.180,00:00:45.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,term that is proportional to delta x to the whatever power times the certain derivative
Dialogue: 0,00:00:45.560,00:00:46.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,of this function.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:46.800,00:00:47.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:47.800,00:00:56.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,For example, a second order scheme, the error term would be proportional to delta x squared
Dialogue: 0,00:00:56.460,00:00:59.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,times maybe the third order derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:59.760,00:01:02.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, the third order derivative of the function may be the fourth order derivative of the
Dialogue: 0,00:01:02.200,00:01:05.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,function, depending on what is the differential operator.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:05.760,00:01:12.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,But the thing is, when you have a discontinuous solution, the third order derivative is what?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:12.420,00:01:13.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is infinite.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:13.420,00:01:14.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:14.420,00:01:15.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is infinite.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:15.420,00:01:17.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,The fourth order derivative is infinite.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:17.920,00:01:25.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the order of accuracy doesn't, Taylor series order of accuracy doesn't make any sense anymore.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:25.340,00:01:29.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So no matter what you do, you get potentially infinite amount of error.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:29.760,00:01:33.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,And use the integral form.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:33.740,00:01:43.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Use the integral form to avoid the potential problems with finite difference.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:43.640,00:01:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,F of u at b minus f of u at a equal to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:52.000,00:01:53.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:53.800,00:01:57.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,And let us divide the whole equation by b minus f of u at a.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:57.500,00:01:58.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:58.500,00:01:59.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, we have the integral form.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:59.500,00:02:00.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have b minus a.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:00.500,00:02:09.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, if you divide this, the integral of the solution over a small range by b over a, we
Dialogue: 0,00:02:09.620,00:02:12.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,get the average.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:12.560,00:02:16.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,The average value of u inside b and a.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:16.220,00:02:28.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,So d dt of u bar, okay, over b and a plus f over the left, on the right side of the
Dialogue: 0,00:02:28.480,00:02:29.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,domain.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:29.500,00:02:30.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:30.500,00:02:32.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,So e to the right minus f left equal to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:32.500,00:02:33.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:33.500,00:02:35.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,A plus f over the right minus f left equal to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:35.500,00:02:37.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Apply, oh sorry, over b minus a.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:37.280,00:02:43.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So apply this in a domain discretized in small intervals.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:43.040,00:02:45.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Delta x, two delta x, three delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:45.000,00:02:50.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is N delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:50.880,00:02:55.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,How many, how many of these averages do we have?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:55.260,00:02:56.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So be very careful.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:56.260,00:02:57.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,We just go wrong.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:57.260,00:02:58.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,We need some more.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:58.260,00:02:59.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,No, we don't want any more.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:59.260,00:03:03.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,about the distinction between finite volume and finite difference. In finite
Dialogue: 0,00:03:03.820,00:03:08.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,difference, depending on boundary conditions, we may have n-1
Dialogue: 0,00:03:08.620,00:03:13.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,unknowns, we may have n-plus-1 unknowns, we may have n unknowns if the two sides
Dialogue: 0,00:03:13.840,00:03:18.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,have different boundary conditions. For finite volume, we always have n
Dialogue: 0,00:03:18.700,00:03:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,unknowns, the number of intervals. So let me write this as u-bar-1, so
Dialogue: 0,00:03:28.000,00:03:36.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,the first self-average u-bar-2, etc., u-bar this would be n, what I have is
Dialogue: 0,00:03:36.100,00:03:52.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,d u-bar-i dt plus b-minus-a would be delta x, right. And this is the flux at the
Dialogue: 0,00:03:52.120,00:03:57.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,right side of the interval, i, which I call i-plus-half because it's
Dialogue: 0,00:03:57.220,00:03:57.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,writing
Dialogue: 0,00:03:57.980,00:04:07.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,between the interval i and i plus 1. Now we use integers to denote the cells, and
Dialogue: 0,00:04:08.780,00:04:17.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,the grid points now become like second-class citizens. So we use the half-fractional
Dialogue: 0,00:04:18.540,00:04:23.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,numbers to denote them. Like in finite difference, the grid points are first-class citizens. We use
Dialogue: 0,00:04:23.900,00:04:29.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,integers to denote them. In finite volume, that's not the case. We reserve the integers to denote
Dialogue: 0,00:04:29.820,00:04:36.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,the cells and the boundaries. They are less important. We use fractional indices.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:37.580,00:04:45.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,Minus f of i minus half equal to zero. All right, so this is our finite volume scheme,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:45.340,00:04:53.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,and this is exact. So there is no approximation yet in this derivation.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:53.900,00:04:57.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now let's start our approximation.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:00.780,00:05:12.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,The approximation needs to be there because the f is evaluated at the grid points.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:12.700,00:05:23.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this f i plus 1, for example, is equal to f of u at x i plus half, right? x i plus half is
Dialogue: 0,00:05:23.900,00:05:33.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,the grid points. And we don't have them in finite volume. We only remember the cell averages.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:34.380,00:05:41.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have to do some kind of interpolation. So this is what we have to interpolate.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:44.460,00:05:49.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,So there are two types of interpolations. One type is to interpolate the u, the solution,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:49.580,00:05:53.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,and apply the flux on top of the interpolated solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:53.900,00:06:03.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,The other way is to compute the flux directly on the cell averages and then interpolate the flux.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:03.260,00:06:07.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,So either way is a perfectly fine finite volume approximation.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:08.380,00:06:15.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,For example, I'm just going to give a very elementary example that is we call the central flux scheme.
