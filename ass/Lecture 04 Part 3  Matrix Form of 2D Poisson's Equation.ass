Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:13.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now let's discuss how to solve this equation. We have a set of linear equations and it can be potentially a huge number of linear equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:13.000,00:00:23.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if nx and ny are both on the order of 100, you get like 10,000 equations. If both are on the order of 1,000, you get like a million equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:23.000,00:00:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So how to solve a million coupled equations?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:30.000,00:00:35.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the best way is to put it into matrix form.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:35.000,00:00:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And one of the things I think you'll learn through going to this class is learn how to put equations into matrix form.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:44.000,00:00:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Once you put equations into matrix form, it suddenly becomes easy to solve with computers.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:52.000,00:00:53.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:53.000,00:01:03.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And there was a person who was a professor in computer science who said that computers are really good at only two things.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:03.000,00:01:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,One is moving and transforming data.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:06.000,00:01:13.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The other is solving linear equations, like doing linear algebra, basically.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:13.000,00:01:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And doing linear algebra requires you to transform whatever problem you need to solve into matrices.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:20.000,00:01:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is what we are going to do.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:22.000,00:01:29.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is to transform this equation into a matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:29.000,00:01:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So first of all, how big does the matrix have to be?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:32.000,00:01:35.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's write out the matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:35.000,00:01:39.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you can see I planned this to be big, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:39.000,00:01:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this times the solution is equal to a right-hand side.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:44.000,00:01:47.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,How big is the matrix?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:47.000,00:01:51.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's say given this number of equations and this number of unknowns.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:51.000,00:01:53.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's the same, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:53.000,00:01:58.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's n times columns.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:58.000,00:02:03.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,n times rows.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:03.000,00:02:09.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The number of equations stands for the number of rows.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:09.000,00:02:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Exactly.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:10.000,00:02:13.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The number of unknowns is the number of columns.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:13.000,00:02:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So before we write down this matrix, let's first write down the unknowns.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:20.000,00:02:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the right-hand side of the equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:25.000,00:02:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So each equation is one line corresponding, one row corresponding to the matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:32.000,00:02:37.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the right-hand side should be equal to the corresponding right-hand side of the equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:37.000,00:02:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's write down F11 here.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:40.000,00:02:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And of course there are two ways to order the right-hand side.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:44.000,00:02:47.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,You can start with F12, F13.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:47.000,00:02:49.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or you can go ahead and write F21, F23.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:50.000,00:02:51.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Sorry.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:51.000,00:02:53.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,F21 and F31.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:53.000,00:03:03.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's here adopt the C or Python type of indexing.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:03.000,00:03:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we go F12, F13 all the way to F1 and Y.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:10.000,00:03:11.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Minus one.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:11.000,00:03:12.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes, thank you.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:12.000,00:03:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if you are using...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:14.000,00:03:17.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is basically how a C or Python put an array.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:17.000,00:03:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if you are using...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:18.000,00:03:19.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is basically how a C or Python put an array.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:19.000,00:03:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if you are using...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:20.000,00:03:21.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is basically how a C or Python put an array.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:21.000,00:03:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Put an array into memory.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:22.000,00:03:27.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because computer memory is actually a 1D, a huge 1D array.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:27.000,00:03:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if you want to represent a 2D or 3D array of data or matrix, you can arrange the matrix,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:34.000,00:03:37.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,arrange the data in the matrix in two ways.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:37.000,00:03:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,One is you arrange the second index first or you arrange the first index first.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:42.000,00:03:47.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you use C or Python, you change the second index first.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:47.000,00:03:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And you can do that.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:48.000,00:03:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you start with the first index first.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:50.000,00:03:55.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And after you cycle through all the second indices, you begin to increment the first
Dialogue: 0,00:03:55.000,00:03:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,index by one.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:56.000,00:04:01.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,In Matlab or Fortran, it is the other way.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:01.000,00:04:03.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,You increment the first index first.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:03.000,00:04:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And after you cycle through the first index, you start to increment the second index by
Dialogue: 0,00:04:08.000,00:04:09.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,one.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:09.000,00:04:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So either way is fine.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:10.000,00:04:15.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I don't have any preference of one way or the other.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:15.000,00:04:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,F22, F23, et cetera.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:16.000,00:04:17.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So either way is fine.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:17.000,00:04:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So either way is fine.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:18.000,00:04:19.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Food galaxii, et cetera.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:19.000,00:04:21.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you can think of there is a mental or a logical separation here.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:21.000,00:04:23.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you can think of there is a mental or a logical separation here.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:23.000,00:04:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,But the computer actually doesn't care.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:25.000,00:04:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I will write dot, dot, dot.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:28.000,00:04:33.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The last one is gonna be F of nx minus one, one.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:33.000,00:04:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And all the way to F, nx minus one, and y minus one.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:40.000,00:04:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So as we arrange the equations that way, it makes sense arrangements to arrange the unknowns
Dialogue: 0,00:04:44.000,00:04:45.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,in the same way.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:45.000,00:04:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,F11.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:46.000,00:04:47.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And Y.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:47.000,00:05:02.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,So u11, u12, etc. to u1, ny-1, u21, u22, all the way to u2, ny-1, etc.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:02.620,00:05:06.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,Going through all the u's.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:06.140,00:05:17.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,And finally, we have u of nx-1, 1, and u of nx-1, ny-1.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:18.360,00:05:23.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,Can somebody look at the equation and tell me what the matrix is going to look like?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:24.480,00:05:27.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's going to be very sparse. That's a very good observation.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:28.480,00:05:29.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Why is it sparse?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:29.860,00:05:35.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because the matrix, each row of the matrix, has nx-1, ny-1.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:36.140,00:05:40.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,And only how many of them are non-zero?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:43.220,00:05:44.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Five, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:45.560,00:05:55.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,If i and j are away from 1 or nx-1, ny-1, five of them are going to be non-zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:55.900,00:06:04.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,If they are close to the boundary, if i and j are close to the boundary, even less are going to be non-zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:05.060,00:06:05.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:05.120,00:06:08.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,So at most, five in a row is going to be non-zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:10.780,00:06:12.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's set an example.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:13.020,00:06:16.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,The first row, we are considering something equal to f11,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:17.040,00:06:20.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,which means this equation has to be i equal to 1, j equal to 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:21.060,00:06:24.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Which indices are going to be non-zero?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:24.320,00:06:28.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean, which entries on the matrix is going to be non-zero?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:29.120,00:06:30.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is the first entry going to be non-zero?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:32.400,00:06:35.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because we have this term and this.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:35.120,00:06:36.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,This term in the equation, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:36.920,00:06:39.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,So u11 is going to appear in the equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:40.360,00:06:40.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:41.140,00:06:48.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the coefficient is going to be minus 2 over delta x squared minus 2 over delta y squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:48.620,00:06:49.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's right.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:51.100,00:06:56.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if you think a little bit carefully for all the other i's and j's,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:57.100,00:07:02.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,the same coefficient are going to appear on the diagonal.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:02.820,00:07:03.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:03.340,00:07:04.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,In the matrix, the diagonal.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:05.120,00:07:09.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this means the corresponding entry of the unknown
Dialogue: 0,00:07:09.540,00:07:13.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,is multiplied by the diagonal entry
Dialogue: 0,00:07:13.100,00:07:17.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,and equal to the same entry on the right-hand side.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:17.940,00:07:26.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Which means we are looking for the term of ij in this linear combination.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:27.460,00:07:27.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:27.680,00:07:29.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,The same ij that appears on the right-hand side.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:30.360,00:07:35.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is always going to be the same number up to,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:35.120,00:07:36.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,all the way to the last one.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:36.800,00:07:40.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,Minus 2 over delta x squared minus 2 over delta y squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:41.620,00:07:42.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:42.120,00:07:43.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,A big task is done.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:43.300,00:07:45.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,We've figured out the diagonal entries.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:46.140,00:07:54.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,And let's, let's, let's cross out these diagonal entries from this equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:54.520,00:07:57.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,We already took care of these two.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:57.940,00:08:01.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,By going through the right-hand side, we also took care of these two.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:01.560,00:08:03.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,And now we have four terms left.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:03.740,00:08:03.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:03.880,00:08:04.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have two terms left.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:04.480,00:08:04.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:04.540,00:08:04.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have two terms left.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:04.900,00:08:05.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:05.000,00:08:05.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have two terms left.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:05.120,00:08:05.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:05.420,00:08:10.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,Again, if we focus on the first row again,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:11.620,00:08:12.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,what other terms are non-zero?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:18.100,00:08:23.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,The one immediately to the right-hand side of the diagonal is going to be non-zero
Dialogue: 0,00:08:23.300,00:08:24.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,because of which term?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:26.380,00:08:30.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because of i plus 1j or ij plus 1?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:32.200,00:08:33.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,ij plus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:33.300,00:08:33.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:33.700,00:08:35.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because we ordered the f.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:35.100,00:08:35.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,And u.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:35.600,00:08:38.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because we ordered the u's in this way.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:38.480,00:08:43.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So u of 1, 2 is going to be corresponding to this term.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:44.920,00:08:45.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:45.920,00:08:47.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is u of 1, 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:47.760,00:08:52.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the coefficient of this one is, of course, 1 over delta y squared
Dialogue: 0,00:08:52.820,00:08:54.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,because we are looking at this term over here.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:55.160,00:08:55.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:56.300,00:08:58.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is there any other terms that is going to be non-zero?

Dialogue: 0,00:13:33.400,00:13:41.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,u1 and y minus 1 and u2 1 right so the ordering of the grid points are this
Dialogue: 0,00:13:41.280,00:13:48.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,this this jump over to here and this this jump over back to here and this and
Dialogue: 0,00:13:48.940,00:13:55.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,this over here and this point is not coupled to this point so there is
Dialogue: 0,00:13:55.360,00:14:05.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,nothing here so the so the second I index or the second column of in this
Dialogue: 0,00:14:05.180,00:14:14.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,plot is the same but we are gonna have a block that is the same as this and in
Dialogue: 0,00:14:14.980,00:14:21.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,addition to a 1 over delta x block over here we also get a 1 over delta x squared

Dialogue: 0,00:14:24.400,00:14:24.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,and
Dialogue: 0,00:14:25.360,00:14:28.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,so so at the end we are going to get
Dialogue: 0,00:14:28.700,00:14:35.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,what's called a penta diagonal structure so we get one diagonal over here one
Dialogue: 0,00:14:35.320,00:14:40.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,diagonal immediately above one diagonal immediately below and one diagonal that
Dialogue: 0,00:14:40.860,00:14:53.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,is an y minus 1 away from the diagonal and we also get another diagonal and Y
