Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:04.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So phi of r should be exactly equal to 0 whenever r is less than 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:05.560,00:00:10.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, let's then figure out if the positive part of this proposal works.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:11.580,00:00:16.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,We only considered a case where r is equal to 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:16.400,00:00:21.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we know that phi is equal to 1 is the appropriate value.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:21.660,00:00:25.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's consider two cases when phi is less than 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:25.040,00:00:30.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,when r is less than 1, greater than 0, and when r is greater than 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:31.060,00:00:35.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's first consider this case when r is between 0 and 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:37.000,00:00:45.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So just to draw this case, r is less than 1 means let's look at the definition.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:46.420,00:00:49.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,It means the difference between ui and ui minus 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:49.380,00:00:55.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,the difference between ui plus 1 and ui is less than the difference between ui and ui minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:55.580,00:00:59.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the slope is higher on the left than on the right.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:00.260,00:01:05.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So ui, ui minus 1, and ui plus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:05.540,00:01:09.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the case when I have r between 0 and 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:10.640,00:01:16.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so the question is when I want to reconstruct the solution at i plus half
Dialogue: 0,00:01:16.840,00:01:18.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,using ui minus 1 and ui,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:19.640,00:01:24.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,how should I guarantee that the solution would never overwrite?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:25.040,00:01:26.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well, I should.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:26.040,00:01:29.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,To the existing maximum or minimum.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:30.040,00:01:36.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,The proposal we had before, the blue proposal, is whenever r is greater than 0,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:36.540,00:01:42.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is the case, we are performing a linear reconstruction up to here.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:43.040,00:01:47.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Would that guarantee a non-increasing local maxima?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:48.040,00:01:53.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,No, because the ui plus 1 could possibly be a local maxima.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:53.680,00:01:54.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:55.040,00:02:02.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in this particular case, phi equal to 1 actually does not guarantee monotonicity.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:04.040,00:02:07.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,In this case, phi has to be less than what?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:08.040,00:02:09.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,r?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:09.040,00:02:11.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well, it's not easy to figure out.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:11.040,00:02:14.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Actually, let me write the condition here.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:15.040,00:02:19.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the reconstructed value u at i plus half,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:19.040,00:02:24.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think I used the red here, ui plus half left,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:24.040,00:02:36.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,is equal to ui plus ui minus ui minus 1 divided by delta x times delta x over 2 times phi.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:37.040,00:02:38.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:39.040,00:02:40.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:40.040,00:02:47.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this has to be less or equal to ui plus 1 for monotonicity reasons.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:48.040,00:02:53.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, if I look at this inequality and move that ui to the right-hand side,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:53.040,00:02:59.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,what we get is ui minus ui minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:59.040,00:03:07.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,These two delta x's cancel, we get over 2 times phi is less or equal to ui plus 1 minus ui.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:08.040,00:03:09.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:11.040,00:03:17.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we divide this on both sides to get the inequality for phi.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:17.040,00:03:22.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,We get phi is less or equal to 2 times ui plus 1 minus ui
Dialogue: 0,00:03:22.040,00:03:28.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,divided by ui minus ui minus 1, which is exactly 2r.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:30.040,00:03:36.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So phi has to be less than 2r in this range.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:36.040,00:03:44.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,If I draw it, if this is half, 2r at r equal to half is equal to 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:44.040,00:03:51.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is the upper limit for what phi could be within this range.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:52.040,00:03:53.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:53.040,00:03:56.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Does it make sense?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:56.040,00:03:57.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:57.040,00:04:00.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this part doesn't work.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:00.040,00:04:03.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,This part could still work, right, in your proposal.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:03.040,00:04:04.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:04.040,00:04:10.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this part of the domain I can't be.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:10.040,00:04:12.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is what this says.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:12.040,00:04:20.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I already know less than 0, I have to be exactly 0,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:20.040,00:04:23.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I have a slope of phi equal to 2r.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:23.040,00:04:26.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,It has to stay underneath.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:26.040,00:04:31.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,And at r equal to 1, I know I have to be phi equal to 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:31.040,00:04:37.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the other case is when r greater than 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:37.040,00:04:48.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for r greater than 1, we have conditions we want to satisfy is the so-called symmetry of the flux reconstruction scheme.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:48.040,00:04:49.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:49.040,00:04:58.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So when we try to compute, so phi of r,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:58.040,00:05:08.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,so when we multiply phi of r times ui minus ui minus 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:08.040,00:05:18.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,we want it to be the same as phi of 1 over r multiplied by u plus 1 minus ui.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:19.040,00:05:23.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that gives us a symmetric scheme.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:23.040,00:05:29.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,That is, when we flip this x-axis,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:29.040,00:05:36.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,so this is symmetry,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:36.040,00:05:45.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,because if we consider the x-axis to go that way,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:45.040,00:05:48.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,and if we look at a scheme that is,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:48.040,00:05:51.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,if we look at a discretization that has i-th grid point here,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:51.040,00:05:52.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,i plus 1 grid point here,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:52.040,00:05:54.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,and i minus 1 grid point here,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:54.040,00:05:56.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,so this going backwards,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:56.040,00:06:00.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,we are still going to have exactly the same type of reconstruction.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:00.040,00:06:09.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Here r, remember r is defined as ui plus 1 minus ui over ui minus ui minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:09.040,00:06:11.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if we flip the axis,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:11.040,00:06:16.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,if we flip the i plus 1 and i minus 1, r becomes 1 over r.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:16.040,00:06:17.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,And,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:17.040,00:06:22.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,ui minus ui minus 1 becomes ui plus 1 minus ui.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:22.040,00:06:25.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we should have flipped over,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:25.040,00:06:28.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,we should have,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:28.040,00:06:30.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,the symmetry means if we flip this over,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:30.040,00:06:34.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,the solution we get should be equal.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:34.040,00:06:36.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think there may be a minus sign somewhere.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:36.040,00:06:38.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,But like,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:38.040,00:06:41.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,what this tells us is that,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:41.040,00:06:43.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,what this tells us is that,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:43.040,00:06:45.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,ui,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:45.040,00:06:46.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,okay,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:46.040,00:06:51.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,what this tells us is that if you divide both sides by ui minus ui minus 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:51.040,00:06:53.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,what we get is,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:53.040,00:06:55.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,phi of r,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:55.040,00:07:00.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,would be equal to r times phi of 1 over r.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:00.040,00:07:02.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:02.040,00:07:03.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,And,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:03.040,00:07:08.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,if we have in the range of r goes from 0 to 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:08.040,00:07:10.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,phi is less than 2r,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:10.040,00:07:14.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,that translates into the case when,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:14.040,00:07:17.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,the argument of phi is greater than 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:17.040,00:07:20.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because if you take r in between 0 and 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:20.040,00:07:23.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,1 over r is greater than 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:23.040,00:07:27.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if phi has to be less than 2r,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:27.040,00:07:29.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,when r is,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:29.040,00:07:32.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,being between 0 and 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:32.040,00:07:35.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,so if this is less than or equal to 2r,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:35.040,00:07:36.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,it means,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:36.040,00:07:37.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,when,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:37.040,00:07:40.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,it means when 1 over r is greater than 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:40.040,00:07:42.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,phi should be less than,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:42.040,00:07:43.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,what?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:44.040,00:07:47.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,should be less than or equal to 2, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:47.040,00:07:48.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:48.040,00:07:49.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,so there is r here,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:49.040,00:07:50.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,there is r here,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:50.040,00:07:52.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,if you divide on both sides,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:52.040,00:07:55.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,it means phi of 1 over r has to be less than or equal to 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:55.040,00:07:56.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:56.040,00:07:59.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,there is another line that caps the value of phi,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:59.040,00:08:02.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,when r is greater than 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:02.040,00:08:04.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the region,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:04.040,00:08:05.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,where,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:05.040,00:08:09.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,we are going to get monotonic schemes.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:09.040,00:08:10.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:10.040,00:08:13.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,we are going to get monotonic schemes.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:13.040,00:08:14.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:14.040,00:08:15.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:15.040,00:08:16.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,But,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:16.040,00:08:17.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,here is the question.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:17.040,00:08:19.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,If I keep phi equal to 0,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:19.040,00:08:20.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,all the way,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:20.040,00:08:21.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,is that good?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:21.040,00:08:26.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,It satisfies both phi of r less than 2r and phi less than 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:26.040,00:08:31.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,What requirement does phi always equal to 0 not satisfy?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:31.040,00:08:37.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,It also satisfies the criterion that phi is equal to 0 when r is less than 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:37.040,00:08:38.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:38.040,00:08:40.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think that's a good question.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:40.040,00:08:41.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:41.040,00:08:42.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think that's a good question.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:42.040,00:08:43.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:43.040,00:08:48.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,it doesn't satisfy that phi has to equal to 1 when r is equal to 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:48.040,00:08:51.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that is for second order accuracy.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:51.040,00:08:52.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:52.040,00:08:53.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:53.040,00:08:59.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,choosing a phi always equal to 0 is actually going to get us a monotonic scheme.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:59.040,00:09:00.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,But,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:00.040,00:09:01.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,it doesn't have second order accuracy.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:01.040,00:09:03.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's first order accurate.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:03.040,00:09:04.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,And it turns out,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:04.040,00:09:08.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,if we analyze the criterion for second order accuracy,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:08.040,00:09:11.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,we get two more regions that we cannot be in.

Dialogue: 0,00:09:15.040,00:09:18.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,so this is phi equal to 2r,

Dialogue: 0,00:09:29.040,00:09:30.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we cannot,

Dialogue: 0,00:09:37.040,00:09:38.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if phi is here,

Dialogue: 0,00:09:40.040,00:09:41.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if phi is here,

Dialogue: 0,00:09:43.040,00:09:47.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the only region we can get both a monotonic scheme

Dialogue: 0,00:10:11.040,00:10:13.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for phi less than 1,

Dialogue: 0,00:10:27.040,00:10:31.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So these are the two criterions

Dialogue: 0,00:10:49.040,00:10:53.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the first choice is the most,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:53.040,00:10:57.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,is the one that gets us to second order accuracy
Dialogue: 0,00:10:57.040,00:11:00.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,while being as close

Dialogue: 0,00:11:03.040,00:11:05.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,What is that?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:05.040,00:11:07.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Remember, phi equal to 0
Dialogue: 0,00:11:07.040,00:11:09.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,means piecewise constant reconstruction.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:09.040,00:11:10.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:10.040,00:11:12.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Not using the slope at all.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:12.040,00:11:14.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So how do we get second order accuracy
Dialogue: 0,00:11:14.040,00:11:15.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,being the green region
Dialogue: 0,00:11:15.040,00:11:18.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,while be as close to phi equal to 0 as possible?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:18.040,00:11:22.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,No question we have to trace through this 0 line.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:22.040,00:11:24.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,In this region, I can't be state 0,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:24.040,00:11:29.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,but I can stay at r, phi equal to r.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:29.040,00:11:30.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,While in this region,

Dialogue: 0,00:11:35.040,00:11:36.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:36.040,00:11:37.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:37.040,00:11:41.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,this is called the mean mod limiter.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:41.040,00:11:45.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So mean mod

Dialogue: 0,00:11:46.040,00:11:48.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,has three pieces.

Dialogue: 0,00:11:52.040,00:11:55.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's 0 when r is less than 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:55.040,00:11:58.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,And it's r when

Dialogue: 0,00:12:02.040,00:12:06.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,And it's 1 if r is greater or equal to 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:07.040,00:12:10.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's the first type of limiter
Dialogue: 0,00:12:10.040,00:12:12.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,that is going to give us
Dialogue: 0,00:12:12.040,00:12:15.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,second order accuracy and monotonic.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:17.040,00:12:20.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,There are also other limiters.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:20.040,00:12:23.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,For example, the other extreme
Dialogue: 0,00:12:23.040,00:12:26.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,is to stay as high as possible.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:26.040,00:12:27.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:12:27.040,00:12:30.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's the other scheme using the green one
Dialogue: 0,00:12:30.040,00:12:31.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,goes like this.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:31.040,00:12:32.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,It stays 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:32.040,00:12:36.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Still, any working limiter has to stay 0
Dialogue: 0,00:12:36.040,00:12:39.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,for r less than 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:39.040,00:12:42.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then it traces the upper limit
Dialogue: 0,00:12:42.040,00:12:46.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,of the allowable region.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:46.040,00:12:48.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So instead of three pieces,
Dialogue: 0,00:12:48.040,00:12:52.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,it has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 pieces.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:52.040,00:12:58.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this limiter is called a super b.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:58.040,00:13:01.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,It has five cases.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:01.040,00:13:03.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,It is either 0,
Dialogue: 0,00:13:03.040,00:13:05.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,in this range is 2r,
Dialogue: 0,00:13:05.040,00:13:06.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,in this range is 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:13:06.040,00:13:08.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,in this range is r, and 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:08.040,00:13:12.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it can be 0 or 2r,
Dialogue: 0,00:13:12.040,00:13:15.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,or 1 or r or 2,
Dialogue: 0,00:13:15.040,00:13:17.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,depending on if r is greater than 0,
Dialogue: 0,00:13:17.040,00:13:20.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,or r is in between 0 and half,
Dialogue: 0,00:13:20.040,00:13:25.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,or when r is between half and 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:13:25.040,00:13:28.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,and if r is between 1 and 2,
Dialogue: 0,00:13:28.040,00:13:31.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,and r greater than 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:31.040,00:13:32.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:32.040,00:13:35.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is tracing the upper limit

Dialogue: 0,00:13:41.040,00:13:45.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,And you can see that both type,
