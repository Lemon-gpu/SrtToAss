Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:16.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,We have the finite difference approximation, which is dui dt equal to kappa ui plus 1 plus ui minus 1 minus 2 times ui divided by delta x squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:19.020,00:00:24.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,We can also apply the Fourier series on the discrete solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:24.720,00:00:37.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right. So here, we remember that u of i is defined as the numerical solution at u times i delta x, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:39.100,00:00:53.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if you represent using the same Fourier series, we get a summation over k of u hat of k e to the j k instead of x.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:53.820,00:00:54.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,We have a summation over k of u hat of k e to the j k instead of x.

Dialogue: 0,00:00:54.720,00:00:57.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,We have i delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:58.900,00:01:04.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now you know why we use j for the square root of minus 1, because we have i as the index.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:06.760,00:01:07.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:08.200,00:01:18.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, but this summation, it actually doesn't make sense to sum over from minus infinity to infinity.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:19.020,00:01:22.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because of the phenomenon called aliasing.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:22.720,00:01:26.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what does aliasing mean?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:26.900,00:01:49.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Aliasing means that for a particular u k and a different u k that is of a different k, the effect of this term is going to be the same, exactly the same, represented on the discrete grid.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:49.000,00:01:50.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's imagine we have a discrete grid.

Dialogue: 0,00:01:59.060,00:02:11.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,The question, intuitively thinking, if I have one Fourier mode, that is exactly one period.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:12.540,00:02:12.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:13.340,00:02:15.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that is k equal to what?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:17.760,00:02:19.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,1 minus 1, right?

Dialogue: 0,00:02:31.340,00:02:42.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, if I only look at the function value at the discrete points, I can actually draw a different wave that looks exactly the same on these discrete points.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:43.640,00:02:44.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,How do I draw that?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:48.460,00:02:49.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,Anybody have any idea?

Dialogue: 0,00:03:00.240,00:03:00.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Straight lines?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:00.940,00:03:04.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,But remember, I have to be sinusoidal functions.

Dialogue: 0,00:03:20.080,00:03:21.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,But, like, 2 pi is not...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:22.080,00:03:23.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's a lot of frequency.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:23.080,00:03:25.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,2 pi is a period, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:25.080,00:03:30.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you're thinking of increasing the frequency to something that makes it the same?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:32.080,00:03:34.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Anybody wants to come and draw something?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:34.080,00:03:36.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:36.080,00:03:38.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's a very good idea.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:38.080,00:03:44.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we no longer are thinking of functions that are long and smooth.

Dialogue: 0,00:03:46.080,00:03:50.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,have a period that is almost equal to one grid point.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:50.080,00:03:51.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:51.080,00:03:52.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,If we draw a function like that.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:52.080,00:03:54.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we still have maximum being the same,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:54.080,00:03:57.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,but we have a function that goes like this,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:57.080,00:03:59.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,and back to minus 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:59.080,00:04:02.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,and come back to here.

Dialogue: 0,00:04:14.080,00:04:17.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this way we have two functions
