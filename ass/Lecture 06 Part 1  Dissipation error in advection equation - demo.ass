Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:05.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now this lecture will assume you have made the wise choice of a stable scheme.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:06.840,00:00:10.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then the error, the truncation error, now actually matters.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:12.280,00:00:16.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And most times when you use a code that somebody else wrote,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:17.880,00:00:23.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,hopefully they are wise enough to choose a stable scheme, so you get reasonable numbers.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:23.360,00:00:31.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then it's up to you, to the user of the code, to figure out is the solution accurate enough,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:32.180,00:00:35.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,or what kind of error is in the solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:35.980,00:00:40.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that's something we'll talk about in the beginning of this lecture today.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:42.740,00:00:48.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the concept we are going to discuss today is called modified equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:49.220,00:00:53.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,It is based on the fact that when you,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:53.360,00:00:57.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,you discretize a differential equation using a numerical scheme.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:57.960,00:01:03.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,The numerical scheme turns out to be, maybe it is a fairly good approximation
Dialogue: 0,00:01:03.840,00:01:06.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,to the differential equation you want to solve.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:07.740,00:01:14.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,But most of the time, it is actually an even more accurate discretization
Dialogue: 0,00:01:14.260,00:01:19.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,of some differential equation that maybe you didn't want to solve.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:20.000,00:01:23.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that equation, the scheme is actually,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:23.360,00:01:26.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,actually approximating even better is called the modified equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:27.920,00:01:32.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,For example, let's start with the pretty obvious example.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:32.920,00:01:40.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, let's start with the differential equation du dt plus a constant capital U.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:40.080,00:01:42.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So capital U is a constant,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:42.220,00:01:46.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,small u is a function, a solution of the PDE equal to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:48.060,00:01:53.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we all, up to now, we should all know what the solution to this equation looks like.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:53.360,00:01:56.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right? What does the solution to this equation look like?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:58.380,00:02:01.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's say U, let's just say U is greater than zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:01.680,00:02:03.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,What does the solution look like?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:03.800,00:02:07.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's a translation towards which direction?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:09.540,00:02:11.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,To the right, exactly.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:11.760,00:02:14.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so it's a pure translation to the right.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:16.480,00:02:19.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,The solution should maintain its original shape.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:19.300,00:02:23.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's say if I have a periodic domain, the solution should maintain its shape forever.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:23.120,00:02:25.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Forever, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:26.300,00:02:31.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,But in practice, let us discretize this differential equation using
Dialogue: 0,00:02:33.940,00:02:38.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,one of the more stable schemes we discussed in the last lecture.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:38.520,00:02:41.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,A scheme that would even be stable using forward Euler.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:41.360,00:02:44.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,What is that scheme we ended up deriving?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:47.680,00:02:52.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,du dt plus U times what?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:53.120,00:02:54.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Backward.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:54.120,00:02:57.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Backward difference, or upwinding, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:57.120,00:02:59.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,In this case, the solution adverts towards the right.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:59.240,00:03:03.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,The upwinding direction is towards where the wind comes from.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:03.880,00:03:05.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's towards the left.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:05.740,00:03:11.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,So towards the left, that involves U and U .
Dialogue: 0,00:03:11.360,00:03:13.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right? U is towards the left.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:13.720,00:03:17.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So minus divided by delta x, you do Taylor series analysis.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:17.640,00:03:20.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,That is the appropriate discretization.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:20.400,00:03:22.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,That is first order accurate.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:22.300,00:03:22.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:22.660,00:03:23.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:23.120,00:03:24.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:24.120,00:03:25.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:25.120,00:03:27.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that is equal to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:27.300,00:03:31.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if you did that in your class, that would be great.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:31.380,00:03:33.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,But if you didn't, let's...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:33.960,00:03:36.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you did it in your project, that's great.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:36.340,00:03:40.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you didn't, let's code up a scheme like that and figure out...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:40.080,00:03:46.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,And let's take a look at the solution to see how the discretization modifies the behavior
Dialogue: 0,00:03:46.280,00:03:48.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,of the equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:48.060,00:03:51.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's say du dt, upwind.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:51.120,00:03:52.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:52.120,00:03:53.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:53.120,00:03:54.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:54.120,00:03:55.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:55.120,00:03:56.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is T and U.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:56.120,00:03:57.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we are...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:57.120,00:04:04.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's still use od45 to integrate this equation to make sure the time derivative doesn't really...
Dialogue: 0,00:04:04.120,00:04:10.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, so od45 has a lot more accurate time derivative than the spatial discretization we are using.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:10.640,00:04:11.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:11.640,00:04:19.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, so let's use od45 to try to remove a lot of the time discretization error and focus
Dialogue: 0,00:04:19.400,00:04:21.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,on spatial discretization.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:21.120,00:04:22.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:22.120,00:04:28.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,So u is periodic, and let's assume u is in the domain of 0 to 2 pi.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:31.200,00:04:34.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,The first u is at grid point 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:34.780,00:04:39.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,The last u is at grid point 2 pi minus delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:40.280,00:04:45.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because the solution at 2 pi is actually exactly equal to the solution at 0,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:45.240,00:04:47.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,so we don't have to remember that.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:47.140,00:04:57.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,But so n is equal to the length of u, and dx is equal to 2 pi divided by n.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:57.820,00:05:01.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,So n grid points, in this case, periodic domain, n grid points, n intervals.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:03.000,00:05:06.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because we didn't store the solution at the very end.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:09.000,00:05:17.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So du dx is equal to two things.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:17.140,00:05:19.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because we are looking at towards the left,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:19.840,00:05:22.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the very first grid point when we are looking towards the left
Dialogue: 0,00:05:22.700,00:05:24.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,is actually the very last grid point.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:25.140,00:05:35.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the first grid point is u n minus u 1 divided by delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:35.760,00:05:37.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's the very first grid point.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:38.180,00:05:47.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the rest, I can write it as u of 2 to n minus u of 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:47.140,00:05:50.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So u n minus u 1 divided by delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:52.420,00:05:59.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is a kind of, we call a vectorized way of coding
Dialogue: 0,00:05:59.040,00:06:04.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,that works very well in MATLAB or Python or any of the interpreted language.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:04.840,00:06:07.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you're coding Julia, you don't have to do that.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:07.740,00:06:08.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's still fast.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:08.660,00:06:10.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,But if you have MATLAB or Python,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:12.760,00:06:14.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,vectorizing a calculation like this,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:14.960,00:06:16.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,instead of going over a function,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:16.880,00:06:17.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,instead of going over a function,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:17.120,00:06:17.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,instead of going over a for loop,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:18.100,00:06:21.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,is going to be a lot faster than going over the for loop.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:22.880,00:06:28.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is basically looping for i goes from 2 to n.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:28.860,00:06:30.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is u i.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:30.240,00:06:31.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is u i minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:32.240,00:06:32.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:33.840,00:06:34.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:38.460,00:06:38.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:39.100,00:06:41.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,The first line should be u 1 minus u n.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:41.400,00:06:41.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,Thank you.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:43.320,00:06:43.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:44.780,00:06:47.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,So yeah, u i minus u i minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:47.120,00:06:49.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, u i minus 1 is actually u n in this case.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:51.460,00:06:51.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:52.260,00:06:55.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,So my du dt is then equal to,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:55.640,00:06:57.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,according to this formula,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:57.340,00:06:58.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,minus big U times,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:59.300,00:07:00.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,let's put,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:01.580,00:07:03.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,let's, for example, say,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:03.540,00:07:05.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,okay, u is equal to 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:06.280,00:07:06.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,Just to,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:08.000,00:07:11.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,just to serve as an example,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:11.720,00:07:13.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,minus u times du dx.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:14.780,00:07:15.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:15.140,00:07:16.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that is our function.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:17.120,00:07:20.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And let's use od 45 to integrate that.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:22.500,00:07:29.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And so, for example, let's say x is equal to 1 to,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:33.640,00:07:36.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,so that's 0 to 99.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:36.660,00:07:39.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,For example, let's use 100 points divided by 100.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:39.800,00:07:41.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that is our x.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:43.360,00:07:44.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,We should multiply by 2 pi.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:44.900,00:07:45.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:45.180,00:07:46.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, so that is our x.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:47.120,00:07:49.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the way we start,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:49.700,00:07:51.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,what kind of function do we want to start?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:54.920,00:07:56.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's just start with,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:56.560,00:07:58.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,with a bump, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:58.640,00:08:01.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's start with a bump and see how the bump evolves.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:01.960,00:08:03.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,And u 0 is,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:03.460,00:08:04.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean, a good way to,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:05.000,00:08:06.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,an easy way to make a bump
Dialogue: 0,00:08:06.340,00:08:11.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,is to take a sine function.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:11.260,00:08:12.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So sine of,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:12.340,00:08:17.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,sine of x over 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:17.120,00:08:19.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,So x goes from 0 to pi.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:19.300,00:08:22.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, so x, x goes from 0 to 2 pi.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:22.580,00:08:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So x over 2 goes from 0 to pi.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:25.580,00:08:26.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,So a sine bump.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:27.080,00:08:33.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's take it to the 16th power.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:33.920,00:08:34.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:34.820,00:08:38.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you plot x and u 0, you see like a bump.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:38.960,00:08:40.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's also a periodic function.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:41.600,00:08:41.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:43.040,00:08:43.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:44.080,00:08:46.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now we have our initial condition.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:47.120,00:08:49.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's say t and u is equal to,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:51.340,00:08:52.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,oh, by the way, let me ask you,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:53.100,00:08:56.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,if I want the analytic solution to advect over the entire domain
Dialogue: 0,00:08:56.460,00:08:58.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,and come back to exactly the same location
Dialogue: 0,00:08:58.380,00:09:01.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,so that the analytical solution is going to look like
Dialogue: 0,00:09:01.900,00:09:03.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,the same as this one,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:03.880,00:09:06.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,how much time should I integrate the solution for?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:10.300,00:09:12.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,The length of the domain over u, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:14.900,00:09:16.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,So length of the domain, u is like,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:17.120,00:09:18.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,length per time.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:18.800,00:09:20.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,So u is 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:20.740,00:09:21.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,The length of the domain is 2 pi.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:22.020,00:09:23.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I want to integrate by 2 pi.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:24.240,00:09:24.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:25.460,00:09:31.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,So tu is equal to od 45 of at dudt upwind.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:33.060,00:09:35.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,What's the second parameter?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:35.200,00:09:35.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is it time?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:36.820,00:09:38.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,0 to pi.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:39.220,00:09:40.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,And my u 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:40.540,00:09:44.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that is da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:44.060,00:09:45.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm not consistent.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:45.000,00:09:47.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think again, I have this.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:47.120,00:09:54.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,I should be doing this instead of that.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:55.660,00:09:55.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:56.100,00:10:02.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I think it's probably because u is a vertically oriented factor.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:03.560,00:10:05.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's do that again.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:05.780,00:10:06.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now we have a u.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:06.720,00:10:08.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,So u, od 45,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:09.320,00:10:13.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,obviously determined that this interval is too big as a timestamp.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:13.820,00:10:17.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it automatically divided this interval from 0 to 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:17.200,00:10:18.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,It evened out the interval.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:18.880,00:10:20.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,And算 out that kilogram.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:21.060,00:10:23.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the less the less we keep on doing attempts till the end
Dialogue: 0,00:10:23.780,00:10:25.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,when it actually comes to the end,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:25.440,00:10:26.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,we get this dash output
Dialogue: 0,00:10:26.920,00:10:29.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,of which u, 0, and Entscheidung function f,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:29.420,00:10:32.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,so f k's objective being equal to z.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:32.220,00:10:34.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the third case is we to knowing,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:35.880,00:10:37.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,in this case,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:37.920,00:10:40.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,What do you call x-axis sum into a ?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:42.720,00:10:43.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's the one.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:43.040,00:10:44.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's the first case.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:44.420,00:10:45.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,But then again,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:45.240,00:10:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,since the YouTubers just go through the steps,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:46.000,00:10:46.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,what else does this have?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:46.580,00:10:51.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's our numerical solution after this thing
Dialogue: 0,00:10:51.100,00:10:52.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,at x over one period.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:54.980,00:10:57.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Analytical solution again should be exactly the same
Dialogue: 0,00:10:57.280,00:10:58.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,as the blue one.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:58.560,00:11:00.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Numerical solution, the red one.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:00.680,00:11:03.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,Can somebody tell me like, what's,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:03.980,00:11:05.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,what do you, can you describe,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:05.380,00:11:07.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,qualitatively describe the difference
Dialogue: 0,00:11:07.980,00:11:10.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,between the analytical solution which is blue
Dialogue: 0,00:11:10.320,00:11:12.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,and numerical solution which is red?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:12.220,00:11:17.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,It diffused out.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:18.340,00:11:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It diffused out.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:20.000,00:11:24.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's almost as if we are solving not the advection equation
Dialogue: 0,00:11:24.360,00:11:28.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,but an advection, diffusion equation, exactly.
