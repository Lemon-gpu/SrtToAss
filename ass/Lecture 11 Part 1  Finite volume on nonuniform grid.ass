Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Find a volume on non-uniform grid.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:03.220,00:00:11.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Still we have a single spatial dimension, but the space is now divided by a non-uniform set of grid points.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:12.460,00:00:24.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have x0, we have xn, and we have x1, x2, and the spacing between the axes are no longer going to be uniform.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:24.360,00:00:36.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you think of the way we formulated finite volume, there is practically no difference between how we are discretizing a uniform grid and a non-uniform grid.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:36.540,00:00:42.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,We are still going to define a u1 here.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:42.700,00:00:52.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let me rename the grid points to be x of half, x of 1 and half, x and 2 and half, 3 and half, etc.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:52.360,00:00:54.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is going to be n and half.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:54.900,00:00:58.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we still have our volumes being named integers.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:01.520,00:01:05.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Particularly, we define ui as the cell average.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:06.420,00:01:12.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now the cell size is x of i plus half minus x of i minus half.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:12.960,00:01:15.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,We no longer have a uniform delta i.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:15.020,00:01:23.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's call this delta x of i, the size of the ith cell.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:24.360,00:01:32.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have integration over x i minus half to x i plus half of u times dx.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:33.440,00:01:36.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,We have a volume average like that.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:37.020,00:01:41.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Remember, the integral form of the equation applies to any interval.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:41.220,00:01:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if we apply the integral form of the equation, we get dui dt would be equal to 1 over delta xi.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:52.900,00:01:54.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,The derivative of...
Dialogue: 0,00:01:54.360,00:01:59.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,the total amount of quantity inside that volume.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:59.860,00:02:07.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,The derivative of that is the flux at i minus half minus the flux at i plus half.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:08.560,00:02:09.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:11.220,00:02:18.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, we still are going to use finite volume approximation to approximate these fluxes.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:19.540,00:02:23.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the approximation would work in very similar ways.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:24.360,00:02:25.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:25.860,00:02:32.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that is going to give us the same kind of finite volume solution as we had before.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:34.400,00:02:40.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, for example, let's work it out for a very simple scheme.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:40.420,00:02:50.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's copy the same DTT burgers we worked on in the last lecture to the DTT of a non-uniform grid.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:50.660,00:02:51.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:51.760,00:02:52.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's try it out.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:52.520,00:02:53.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we need to get this very simple.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:53.560,00:02:54.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:54.060,00:03:01.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,We're gonna name it now uniform.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:01.000,00:03:05.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the input of that we need to make a grid.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:05.220,00:03:10.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's make a worst possible grid for ourselves.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:10.720,00:03:19.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's make n equal to let's say 100 and let's just make x to be a random.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:19.780,00:03:24.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is it rand or random?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:24.140,00:03:25.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,Rand maybe?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:25.600,00:03:34.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay so x is basically a random set of points within 0 and 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:34.420,00:03:41.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Actually I want to make it n-1 because that's the interior points and I want to append 0
Dialogue: 0,00:03:41.120,00:03:42.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,and 1 in the beginning.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:42.940,00:03:45.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,So x I would make 0 in the beginning.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:45.440,00:03:49.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,I want to sort x in the middle and I put 1 there.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:49.760,00:03:59.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if I plot x it's basically a pretty non-ideal set of points.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:59.080,00:04:05.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let me plot x and 0s 101.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:05.420,00:04:06.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,Plot it like that.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:06.800,00:04:09.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is gonna be our grid points.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:09.120,00:04:13.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,In some places it's terrible, some places it's white.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:13.320,00:04:18.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay so let's try it with that.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:18.080,00:04:19.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's make x to be globals.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:19.760,00:04:26.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that I can use this in the function.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:26.980,00:04:32.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let me make global x.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:32.940,00:04:36.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,n is still gonna be a length of u, that's right.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:36.580,00:04:45.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,And dx is now x of 2 to n minus x 1 to n minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:45.040,00:04:48.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is my dx which is no longer a constant.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:48.480,00:04:49.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,But a length of 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:49.160,00:04:49.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:49.760,00:04:54.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm gonna make this a length n array.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:54.020,00:04:59.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we are gonna be performing the reconstruction.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:59.220,00:05:08.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for simplicity let's make our reconstruction to be, let's make our limiter to be 0 for
Dialogue: 0,00:05:08.460,00:05:09.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,now.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:09.460,00:05:10.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:10.800,00:05:16.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because when we have a non-uniform grid we need to also adapt our limiter with the different
Dialogue: 0,00:05:16.640,00:05:17.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,x, i's.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:17.640,00:05:18.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,For example when we compute our slope.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:18.820,00:05:19.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have a non-uniform grid.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:19.060,00:05:19.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:19.160,00:05:19.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have a non-uniform grid.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:19.460,00:05:19.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:19.560,00:05:19.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have a non-uniform grid.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:19.660,00:05:19.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:19.720,00:05:19.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:19.760,00:05:23.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that means we need to also adapt our complete grid, so we have 2 large and common
Dialogue: 0,00:05:23.080,00:05:23.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,and single units.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:23.520,00:05:23.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:23.640,00:05:24.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we need to also adapt our complete grid.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:24.020,00:05:24.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:24.220,00:05:24.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we need to also adapt our complete grid.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:24.500,00:05:27.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,And also the slope needs to be, the slope needs to be considering half of the delta
Dialogue: 0,00:05:27.580,00:05:32.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,x in 1 cell plus the half of another delta x in another cell, right.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:32.800,00:05:39.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So because if we have a non-uniform grid, the slope from here to here needs to be taking
Dialogue: 0,00:05:39.540,00:05:44.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,half of the slope, half of the grid size, into adjacent cells.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:44.800,00:05:49.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,But let's avoid that complexity for now.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:49.460,00:06:06.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, if we avoid that complexity, we are going to reconstruct basically our U plus half left
Dialogue: 0,00:06:06.840,00:06:12.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,is going to be the solution, the cell average on the left of the interface.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:12.400,00:06:17.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,U plus half right is going to be the solution cell average at the right of the interface.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:17.340,00:06:23.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,We are still going to apply good enough scheme and this is going to be dot divide.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:23.720,00:06:30.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,So everything else is going to be pretty much the same.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:30.780,00:06:44.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in MATLAB, let's compute x center to be x1 to n minus 1 plus x2 to n divided by 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:44.580,00:06:47.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,And let's say our U0 is sine of x1.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:47.320,00:06:52.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have 2pi times x center.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:52.320,00:07:01.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,If we plot x center, U0, this is still our initial solution, the same as what we had
Dialogue: 0,00:07:01.260,00:07:03.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,last time.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:03.320,00:07:16.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now let's solve it using ODE45, DDT non-uniform, 0 to let's say 0.5, using U0 as initial condition.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:17.320,00:07:19.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,We have a solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:19.080,00:07:33.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's plot x center and U to see what the solution looks like.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:33.320,00:07:36.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:36.320,00:07:37.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:37.320,00:07:39.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's what the solution looks like.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:39.320,00:07:43.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's still a first order accurate scheme.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:43.320,00:07:45.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,And because we have a non-uniform grid.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:45.320,00:07:46.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,We have a non-uniform grid.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:46.320,00:07:47.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,We have a non-uniform grid.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:47.320,00:07:54.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the amount of dissipation we are experiencing depends on where the sharp feature of the
Dialogue: 0,00:07:54.880,00:07:56.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,solution lies.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:56.080,00:08:01.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,If the sharp feature of the solution travels through a bigger cell, we experience more
Dialogue: 0,00:08:01.880,00:08:03.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,dissipation error.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:03.320,00:08:07.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,If it travels through a smaller cell, we experience less dissipation error.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:07.600,00:08:16.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the solution goes not...so the dissipation no longer acts as if it's a constant amount
Dialogue: 0,00:08:16.080,00:08:17.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,of dissipation.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:17.080,00:08:23.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's a little bit weakly, but like we still get a solution that looks pretty good.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:23.640,00:08:24.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:24.640,00:08:31.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is how we can apply finite volume schemes in the non-uniform grid.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:31.780,00:08:37.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Really minimum change to what we have to do on uniform grid.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:37.680,00:08:42.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,The limiter would require you to do a little bit more work adjusting the different grid
Dialogue: 0,00:08:42.240,00:08:45.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,sizes, but still minor change.
