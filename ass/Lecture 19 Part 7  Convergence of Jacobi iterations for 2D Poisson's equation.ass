Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:10.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,right so let me make let me make a title 100 iterations okay and let's compare
Dialogue: 0,00:00:10.440,00:00:26.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,with with the original solution you exact I should be dividing by 255 also
Dialogue: 0,00:00:26.040,00:00:34.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,okay so this is my original solution title exact solution so I have the exact
Dialogue: 0,00:00:34.860,00:00:44.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,compared to a hundred relations what do we see darker right somehow the solution
Dialogue: 0,00:00:44.460,00:00:50.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,is after hundred regions is darker than the exact solution so that hasn't
Dialogue: 0,00:00:50.480,00:00:55.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,exactly converged yet and let's look at what is
Dialogue: 0,00:00:55.920,00:00:56.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,the exact solution so let's look at what is the exact solution so let's look at
Dialogue: 0,00:00:56.020,00:00:56.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,what is the exact solution so let's look at what is the exact solution so let's look at the
Dialogue: 0,00:00:56.620,00:00:59.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,which we have been marking the approximateintelectual as a
Dialogue: 0,00:01:00.120,00:01:00.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,comes from the differences so
Dialogue: 0,00:01:03.040,00:01:05.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,okay so
Dialogue: 0,00:01:07.200,00:01:08.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,after the 100 iterations
Dialogue: 0,00:01:09.080,00:01:11.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,as long as really
Dialogue: 0,00:01:11.660,00:01:14.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,I have an answer
Dialogue: 0,00:01:14.960,00:01:16.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,so
Dialogue: 0,00:01:16.840,00:01:17.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,that means
Dialogue: 0,00:01:18.940,00:01:19.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,after the
Dialogue: 0,00:01:20.900,00:01:21.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,centacking
Dialogue: 0,00:01:23.060,00:01:23.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,it seems that
Dialogue: 0,00:01:24.640,00:01:25.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,the
Dialogue: 0,00:01:25.220,00:01:31.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,dimension must agree. So my uexec after expanded, I call it uexpanded.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:31.860,00:01:42.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right? Okay. This is my solution error. That's interesting because it's like, of
Dialogue: 0,00:01:42.320,00:01:47.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,course we know that if you subtract, if you add these 100
Dialogue: 0,00:01:47.980,00:01:51.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,iterations with the solution error, I get the exact solution. That's just the
Dialogue: 0,00:01:51.920,00:01:56.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,definition of the solution error. But there is something interesting that the
Dialogue: 0,00:01:56.320,00:02:01.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,100 iteration solution seems to be picking up the contours pretty well, like
Dialogue: 0,00:02:01.180,00:02:07.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,all the sharp features, right? While the solution error seems to contain a blurred
Dialogue: 0,00:02:07.100,00:02:17.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,image of the original solution. So let's keep iterating. Let's do this equal, let's
Dialogue: 0,00:02:17.720,00:02:21.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,look at what's the solution after a thousand iterations.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:21.100,00:02:21.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:21.920,00:02:26.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,I did the thousand iterations. Let's make another figure.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:26.720,00:02:37.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,I am sure you divide by 255.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:37.400,00:02:47.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,Title, a thousand iterations. Now it's a lot better in that there it's not as
Dialogue: 0,00:02:47.480,00:02:51.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,dark as 100 iterations, right? A thousand- a hundred. A thousand is
Dialogue: 0,00:02:51.680,00:02:51.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,not you.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:51.800,00:02:58.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,now a lot brighter but it's still not as bright as the true solution exact
Dialogue: 0,00:02:58.340,00:03:06.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,solution a thousand iterations and if we start to look at where's MATLAB if we
Dialogue: 0,00:03:06.300,00:03:19.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,look at the the solution error so figure I am sure you expand it I will change
Dialogue: 0,00:03:19.700,00:03:26.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,this to solution error after thousand iterations that's what I get so now
Dialogue: 0,00:03:26.460,00:03:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's not even a blurred image it's just completely blurred so I
Dialogue: 0,00:03:32.000,00:03:43.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,basically get a very smooth white blurb of light okay right so now now what
Dialogue: 0,00:03:43.440,00:03:48.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,I can see is that because the solution error contains completely smoothed
Dialogue: 0,00:03:48.620,00:03:49.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,features
Dialogue: 0,00:03:49.620,00:03:49.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,so I can change this to solution error so that
Dialogue: 0,00:03:49.700,00:03:55.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,what I can expect is that the solution after a thousand iterations should
Dialogue: 0,00:03:55.640,00:04:04.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,already contain all the anything that is not as smooth as basically a smooth
Dialogue: 0,00:04:04.280,00:04:14.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,hill right on the solution. Now let's do more. So we know it'll finally converge.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:14.420,00:04:20.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's just brute force it, make two other zeros. It may run for a while, right,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:20.960,00:04:27.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,but after it finishes we know it should converge pretty much to the right
Dialogue: 0,00:04:27.560,00:04:33.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,solution. Now the question as it is running is can we know a priori what we
Dialogue: 0,00:04:33.780,00:04:40.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,were observing? Can we know how the convergence is going to happen? What
Dialogue: 0,00:04:40.360,00:04:43.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,modes converge is faster, what modes converge is slower?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:43.920,00:04:44.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we know that the convergence is going to happen. What modes converge is faster, what modes converge is slower?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:44.420,00:04:50.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So why after many iterations I still get a solution error that is like a very
Dialogue: 0,00:04:50.260,00:05:01.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,smoothed blurb of light? Yes? Right, remember our eigenvalue eigenvector
Dialogue: 0,00:05:01.600,00:05:09.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,analysis on the error equation? The error is going to decay to zero, right, which
Dialogue: 0,00:05:09.060,00:05:12.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,now we have finished.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:12.300,00:05:19.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's do the solution exact I am sure.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:19.060,00:05:25.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Solution, okay, solution after now it's 100,000 iterations.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:25.760,00:05:39.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Expanded. So now this is the solution error which is completely dark now, which is a
Dialogue: 0,00:05:39.640,00:05:41.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,good sign.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:41.800,00:05:48.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Figure I am sure you title.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:48.560,00:05:58.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is my solution after many, many iterations and comparing this to the exact solution we
Dialogue: 0,00:05:58.300,00:06:06.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,can't see any difference, right? So the solution converged, but it took a lot of iterations.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:06.860,00:06:11.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So right, so the Jacobi iteration converges for this problem, but not particularly for
Dialogue: 0,00:06:11.680,00:06:12.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,this problem.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:12.680,00:06:18.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what does that mean if we look back into this error equation?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:18.440,00:06:34.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,We know that after every iteration, the exponent on this lambda, on this eigenvalues are going
Dialogue: 0,00:06:34.940,00:06:36.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,to be increased by one.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:36.440,00:06:38.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,So lambdas that are close to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:38.440,00:06:40.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,So lambda that are close to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:40.440,00:06:41.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So lambda that are close to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:41.560,00:06:41.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So lambda that are close to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:41.680,00:06:42.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So lambda that are close to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:42.680,00:06:48.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,Would be taken to zero very fast if you take power of k, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:48.180,00:06:54.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if, I mean it doesn't have even to be close to zero even if lambda has an entry that is
Dialogue: 0,00:06:54.720,00:06:57.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,point nine.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:57.560,00:07:02.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,After a thousand iterations it's going to be pretty much zero, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:02.780,00:07:11.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So point nine to a thousand is like 10 to the minus 64.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:11.560,00:07:15.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Basically even after a hundred iterations if I have an eigenvalue equal to point nine
Dialogue: 0,00:07:15.960,00:07:18.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,it'll be pretty much zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:18.020,00:07:23.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,So anything that is away from one with a sufficient distance is going to be zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:23.740,00:07:30.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So even after a thousand iterations we still have some mode there.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:30.080,00:07:33.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Means that has to be very close to one, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:33.840,00:07:38.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So point nine nine it's also going to be pretty much zero after a thousand iterations.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:38.680,00:07:41.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Point nine nine nine would still have something there.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:41.560,00:07:51.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we probably have an eigenvalue in the matrix that is as large as point nine nine nine,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:51.540,00:07:52.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,right?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:52.540,00:07:57.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,We know it wouldn't exceed one because if it exceeds one it'll diverge.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:57.440,00:08:04.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,So but it must have an eigenvalue that is almost one.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:04.340,00:08:07.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,And can we guess what the corresponding eigenvector is?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:07.600,00:08:11.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,What is the corresponding column in V look like?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:11.440,00:08:19.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is the eigenvector corresponding to the very close to one eigenvalue representing a smooth
Dialogue: 0,00:08:19.180,00:08:22.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,feature or an oscillatory feature?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:22.420,00:08:23.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,After .
Dialogue: 0,00:08:23.420,00:08:26.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes, the error was smooth after many iterations.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:26.180,00:08:33.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,That means the remaining part, right, after you take K to be large, the remaining part
Dialogue: 0,00:08:33.060,00:08:40.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,would correspond to the column of V corresponding to a large eigenvalue.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:40.280,00:08:41.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,By large I mean close to one.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:41.380,00:08:46.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Not .9 but .999.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:46.320,00:08:53.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that is a way we are going to analyze the behavior of these iterative methods starting
Dialogue: 0,00:08:53.280,00:08:54.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,from next lecture.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:54.780,00:09:01.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then we are also going to be talking about what can we do to accelerate it.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:01.100,00:09:03.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that's going to be our multigrid method.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:03.360,00:09:04.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:04.360,00:09:09.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,I have a question about your code and why we don't need to use f in the formulation
Dialogue: 0,00:09:09.360,00:09:10.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,of u k plus.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:10.360,00:09:11.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:11.380,00:09:12.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,You used the previous guess.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:12.380,00:09:13.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,But in that figure right there.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:13.380,00:09:14.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,Here?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:14.380,00:09:15.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:15.380,00:09:16.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:16.380,00:09:17.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,Why don't we need to use f?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:17.380,00:09:18.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,f is added here.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:18.380,00:09:29.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I can, so here I can either initialize u k p plus one to be zero and add the f into
Dialogue: 0,00:09:29.680,00:09:30.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,here.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:30.680,00:09:39.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Here I just took the alternative approach of initializing this to the f term to this,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:39.200,00:09:40.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,I initialized the next iteration to this term.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:40.380,00:09:41.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:41.380,00:09:43.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then added this term in the loop.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:43.780,00:09:44.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:44.780,00:09:49.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's this line that added the f term.
