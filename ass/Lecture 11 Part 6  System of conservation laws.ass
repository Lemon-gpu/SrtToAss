Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, let's go to system of conservation laws.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:06.000,00:00:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Find a volume and actually also find a difference are not very difficult with not just one conservation law but a system of conservation laws.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:16.000,00:00:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,A system of conservation law is going to be multiple quantities coupled with each other.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:26.000,00:00:43.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,In a conservation law sense, that means the flux of one quantity is determined not just as a function of that quantity itself but as a multivariate function of several quantities.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:43.000,00:00:53.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The simplest type of conservation law is coupling two quantities.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:53.000,00:00:55.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the time derivative of...
Dialogue: 0,00:00:55.000,00:00:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let me...
Dialogue: 0,00:00:56.000,00:00:58.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let me illustrate it in a scalar sense.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:58.000,00:01:11.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The time derivative of u1 plus a flux, I call it 1, of u1 and u2 dx is equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:11.000,00:01:23.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Also, the time derivative of u2 is a function also of u1 and u2.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:23.000,00:01:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,If f1 and f2 are both 0,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:25.000,00:01:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,f1 and f2 are both 0,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:26.000,00:01:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,if f1 and f2 are both linear, then this is not very different from the second project we just submitted last week.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:34.000,00:01:41.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,But in this case, f1 and f2 can be nonlinear functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:41.000,00:01:43.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm just going to give very...
Dialogue: 0,00:01:43.000,00:01:47.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm just going to give one example that is exactly like that.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:47.000,00:01:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's called the shallow water equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:50.000,00:01:51.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's called the shallow water equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:51.000,00:01:53.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's called the shallow water equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:53.000,00:01:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's called the shallow water equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:54.000,00:01:55.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's called the shallow water equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:55.000,00:01:58.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's called the shallow water equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:58.000,00:02:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Shallow water equation is the equation that models the movement of water, of any fluid,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:04.000,00:02:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,under the influence of gravity, a shallow layer of water.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:10.000,00:02:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It actually describes, for example, the waves on a beach pretty well before it breaks.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:18.000,00:02:19.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So...
Dialogue: 0,00:02:19.000,00:02:23.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And you can do a lot of interesting experiments with it.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:23.000,00:02:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the reason actually...
Dialogue: 0,00:02:25.000,00:02:29.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you look at the movement of waves over a beach,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:29.000,00:02:33.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the reason the wave breaks is...
Dialogue: 0,00:02:33.000,00:02:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,In this shallow water equation, it's going to appear as a shock wave in the shallow water equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:40.000,00:02:45.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,You're going to create a discontinuity in the height of the water,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:45.000,00:02:51.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,which in real case, it'll just fall down and break as a wave.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:51.000,00:02:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in the shallow water equation, it's going to be like this.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:52.000,00:02:58.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in the shallow water equation, the two quantities we are modeling
Dialogue: 0,00:02:58.000,00:03:01.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,are first of all the height of the water.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:01.000,00:03:07.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you have, let's say, a water column like that.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:07.000,00:03:12.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the height of the water, and also the velocity of the water.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:12.000,00:03:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right, how fast the water is moving, either towards the left or towards the right.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:18.000,00:03:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And in reality,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:20.000,00:03:29.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the reason that h is a conservative quantity is because we are modeling water as incompressible.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:29.000,00:03:37.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So h integrated over x is what?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:37.000,00:03:41.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you integrate h over x,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:41.000,00:03:45.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's the volume, it's how much water you have.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:45.000,00:03:49.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And velocity doesn't really integrate to be a conservative quantity.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:49.000,00:03:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So instead, we use u times h as a conservative variable.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:56.000,00:04:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you multiply u over h and integrate over dx, what do you get?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:06.000,00:04:11.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Also, we need to assume the density is a constant, which is the case.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:11.000,00:04:17.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you multiply rho times u times h over dx, what do you get?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:17.000,00:04:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The momentum.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:18.000,00:04:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The momentum, exactly.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:20.000,00:04:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So these are the two conservative quantities in this equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:26.000,00:04:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we can see how the flux of each quantity is going to be a function of the other quantity.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:34.000,00:04:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,For example,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:38.000,00:04:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,in order to derive this equation, it's actually a lot easier to derive it from the integral form.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:44.000,00:04:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So d dt, for example,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:46.000,00:04:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,of the integral over h,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:48.000,00:04:58.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is the total amount of water in between a and b,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:58.000,00:05:05.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,is equal to the flux into the volume minus the flux out of the volume.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:05.000,00:05:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,What is the flux of water into the volume?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:16.000,00:05:17.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:18.000,00:05:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Multiplied by u?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:20.000,00:05:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's actually h, yes, multiplied by u at point a minus h times u at point b.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:30.000,00:05:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's going to be a and b, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:34.000,00:05:39.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so that means the time derivative of h,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:39.000,00:05:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean, here h times u is the flux.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:42.000,00:05:47.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The flux depends on not just h, but also some other quantities.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:48.000,00:05:51.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, how about these other quantities?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:51.000,00:05:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,How about the time derivative of rho times dx?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:56.000,00:06:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,How does the momentum change in time?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:00.000,00:06:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,What is the momentum flux?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:07.000,00:06:09.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's a little bit more complex, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:09.000,00:06:11.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,rho h u squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:11.000,00:06:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So first, there is a term, u h u squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:16.000,00:06:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's basically the momentum itself times u.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:20.000,00:06:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's how much momentum is going,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:22.000,00:06:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,that's the momentum carried by the fluid going into the volume, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:28.000,00:06:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's one term.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:30.000,00:06:35.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Interestingly, there is another term that wouldn't be here if there is no gravity.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:37.000,00:06:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The gravity is going to create a pressure force that acts on surface a and surface b,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:44.000,00:06:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the pressure force is going to create a momentum.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:48.000,00:06:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's going to create a source term in the momentum,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:50.000,00:06:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,but because the pressure only applies on the two interfaces,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:56.000,00:07:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,it can be written as a flux.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:00.000,00:07:11.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that flux is going to be the average height of the column.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:11.000,00:07:13.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you take the center, that's the average height.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:14.000,00:07:15.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Why would you want that?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:15.000,00:07:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because the slope, if u is already a sub-circle,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:18.000,00:07:21.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,you can be fine, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:21.000,00:07:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,You say momentum is now going to be a g xت
Dialogue: 0,00:07:24.000,00:07:35.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so you waste the zero Eastern gain so you mention,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:35.000,00:07:43.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,y själv ist noch ein Ü 小
Dialogue: 0,00:07:43.040,00:07:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,z quer auf einem finishes square,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:44.000,00:07:52.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,to 0, and the partial rho uh, partial t,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:52.160,00:08:01.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,plus partial x of rho hu squared plus half of rho gh
Dialogue: 0,00:08:01.320,00:08:02.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,is equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:09.260,00:08:10.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:10.240,00:08:13.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is because if you try, if you integrate the pressure
Dialogue: 0,00:08:13.820,00:08:17.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,force over the column of water, the pressure
Dialogue: 0,00:08:17.620,00:08:19.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,is equal to 0 at the top, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:19.580,00:08:21.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So there is no pressure at the top.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:21.120,00:08:25.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,The pressure at the bottom is rho gh.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:25.600,00:08:28.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, actually, there is, because there is an integral,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:28.060,00:08:29.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,we have a square.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:29.020,00:08:29.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, sorry.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:29.920,00:08:31.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,We have a square here.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:31.880,00:08:37.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right, so we are integrating the pressure at the bottom
Dialogue: 0,00:08:37.120,00:08:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,is rho gh.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:40.000,00:08:44.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we are integrating over a height of h.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:44.940,00:08:51.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the total pressure force is half of rho gh squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:54.520,00:08:57.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:57.260,00:09:00.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now if you say this is not in standard conservation form,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:00.280,00:09:09.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,because there is a weird rho hu here, right, that
Dialogue: 0,00:09:09.240,00:09:09.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,can be fixed.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:09.920,00:09:09.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:09.960,00:09:09.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:09.980,00:09:11.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we can fix this.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:11.560,00:09:13.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is a simple way to do it.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:13.100,00:09:18.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's say we define this momentum equal to rho uh.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:18.340,00:09:25.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then let's rewrite these two equations as the following.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:25.900,00:09:36.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the hu is going to be partial x of m divided by rho, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:36.660,00:09:39.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Rho is a constant.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:39.440,00:09:39.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,And.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:39.940,00:09:50.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Partial m, partial t, plus we also write the flux as just a function of m and h.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:50.220,00:09:59.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in this case, we have a u square, which means we have to square this m.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:59.340,00:10:03.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,By squaring m, we have rho square, u square, h square.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:03.580,00:10:08.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So to get this rho hu, we need to divide by rho and divide by h.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:08.460,00:10:08.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:08.900,00:10:09.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:09.400,00:10:09.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:09.980,00:10:13.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:13.020,00:10:22.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,The second term is, can be just written as half of rho g times h square is equal to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:22.080,00:10:29.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now both equations are written in terms of either constants, like rho and g, and these
Dialogue: 0,00:10:29.180,00:10:32.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,two conservative quantities, h and m.
