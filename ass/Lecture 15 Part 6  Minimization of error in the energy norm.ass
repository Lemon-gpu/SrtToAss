Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:08.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,So first of all, finite element, it has a certain type of optimality in it.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:09.680,00:00:15.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,In the sense it minimizes the so-called energy norm, if there is an energy norm.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:16.640,00:00:19.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so the energy norm, let's first define energy norm.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:19.880,00:00:28.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,The energy norm is defined as AU of U.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:28.400,00:00:33.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, when A is symmetric.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:38.020,00:00:43.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so the energy norm is only well defined for symmetric U,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:43.580,00:00:47.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,which means A of U and V is the same as A of V and U.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:51.640,00:00:58.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the energy norm is actually equivalent to whatever norm we,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:58.400,00:01:00.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,we have the norm of U.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:00.680,00:01:05.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,If the bilinear form A is coercive and continuous by equivalent,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:06.340,00:01:10.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,what I mean is A of U and V is great,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:11.040,00:01:18.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,is greater or equal to this B of A of U and U is equal to not,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:18.440,00:01:28.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,not just B times the norm of U square and less or equal to C times the norm of U square.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:28.400,00:01:31.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is continuity.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:33.440,00:01:37.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is coercivity.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:39.640,00:01:40.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:43.420,00:01:49.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the, this is, this is the definition of two norms being, being equivalent.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:52.080,00:01:56.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,So two norms being equivalent doesn't mean they give you the same numbers.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:56.680,00:01:58.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,They just, they, they,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:58.320,00:01:58.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,they give you the same numbers.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:58.380,00:01:59.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So two norms being equivalent can be used to bond each other.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:00.180,00:02:02.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you know one norm is bounded, the other norm is bounded.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:03.060,00:02:05.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you know one norm is not zero, the other norm is not zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:06.100,00:02:09.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's what I mean by, by two norms being continuous.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:10.300,00:02:10.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:11.020,00:02:18.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the energy norm is, is defined just as the number that is produced by the bilinear function.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:19.020,00:02:19.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:20.940,00:02:26.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,So why does finite element minimize the energy norm, minimize the error in the energy norm?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:26.700,00:02:28.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's look at,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:28.100,00:02:32.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,let's look at the energy norm of the residual of the error in the finite element.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:32.780,00:02:34.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,So U minus UH.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:35.560,00:02:37.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,U minus UH.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:38.620,00:02:40.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,And look at what it is.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:42.700,00:02:45.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's compare it with
Dialogue: 0,00:02:45.580,00:02:57.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,A of the energy norm of the difference between U and the WH.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:57.340,00:02:57.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,Find out.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:57.980,00:03:10.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,So there's an arbitrary member of WH for another WH in the same lower dimensional space,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:10.580,00:03:12.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,in the same finite dimensional space.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:12.580,00:03:19.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So here the difference is VH is specifically the solution of the finite element.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:19.260,00:03:27.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,That satisfies the weak form for subset of these while WH is any function in the,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:27.500,00:03:29.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,in the lower dimensional space.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:31.700,00:03:34.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what we can do is the following.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:35.580,00:03:37.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,A of U minus,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:42.100,00:03:43.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,okay, what we can do is,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:46.060,00:03:47.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,U minus WH,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:48.620,00:03:50.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,U minus WH,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:52.420,00:03:56.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,can be expressed as the summation of U minus WH.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:56.900,00:04:00.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is using bilinearity U minus UH.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:00.900,00:04:04.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,Plus A of U minus WH,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:04.900,00:04:07.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,UH minus WH.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:07.900,00:04:10.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,And let's see.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:10.900,00:04:17.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,And let's take advantage of the fact that
Dialogue: 0,00:04:17.900,00:04:21.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,A of U and UH minus WH,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:21.900,00:04:22.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,can be expressed as the summation of U minus UH.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:22.900,00:04:25.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,And let's take advantage of the fact that
Dialogue: 0,00:04:25.140,00:04:25.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,A of U and UH minus WH,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:25.900,00:04:28.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,minus WH,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:28.100,00:04:35.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,is equal to L of U,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:35.380,00:04:35.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,sorry,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:35.900,00:04:38.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,L of UH minus WH.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:38.100,00:04:41.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is because UH minus,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:41.900,00:04:46.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,this is because UH minus WH,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:46.420,00:04:48.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,is a function, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:48.500,00:04:50.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is basically using the,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:50.380,00:04:52.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,the fact that you satisfies the weak form.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:52.580,00:04:54.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:54.740,00:05:05.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,the same linear functional is also equal to u or a of uh uh minus wh right so this is using the
Dialogue: 0,00:05:05.060,00:05:12.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,fact that uh is the solution of the finite element and it satisfies the weak form for any uh minus
Dialogue: 0,00:05:12.180,00:05:19.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,wh which is in the lower dimensional space in the finite dimensional space so by using these two
Dialogue: 0,00:05:19.940,00:05:30.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,the right hand side of the equation becomes a of u minus wh u minus uh plus
Dialogue: 0,00:05:30.580,00:05:37.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,a of so that basically allows me to replace this u by uh
Dialogue: 0,00:05:37.720,00:05:45.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,all right
Dialogue: 0,00:05:45.560,00:05:48.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,good
Dialogue: 0,00:05:49.940,00:05:58.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,okay so the next step is to basically apply the same trick to this term okay so
Dialogue: 0,00:05:59.380,00:06:05.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,the next step is doing okay so let me write this down u minus wh
Dialogue: 0,00:06:06.820,00:06:16.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,u minus uh can be written as a of u minus uh u minus uh
Dialogue: 0,00:06:18.420,00:06:18.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,plus
Dialogue: 0,00:06:19.940,00:06:23.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,so we already said uh so okay so first of all let's use the fact that a symmetric so also u of
Dialogue: 0,00:06:23.940,00:06:27.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,u h u minus uh can be written as a of u minus uh u h minus wh
Dialogue: 0,00:06:29.620,00:06:36.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,so we have we have basically the same thing
Dialogue: 0,00:06:36.320,00:06:42.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,here except for when we have a financial hypothesis
Dialogue: 0,00:06:42.580,00:06:46.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,and he has something else that he just can't and then we have something else okay which is this uh
Dialogue: 0,00:06:46.980,00:06:48.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,호� by the empathy well before the необходsinality of the of the um Chi Ha wh
Dialogue: 0,00:06:49.940,00:07:00.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,we have uh uh here so this term can be written as uh let me write it down u minus uh u minus uh
Dialogue: 0,00:07:00.180,00:07:07.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,this term can be written as again i can again from this from this analysis we can replace this u here
Dialogue: 0,00:07:07.460,00:07:16.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,by by uh uh right so so this is actually equal to uh a of
Dialogue: 0,00:07:19.380,00:07:28.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,uh minus wh zero because uh minus wh uh belongs to the lower dimensional space so this
Dialogue: 0,00:07:28.980,00:07:37.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,bilinear form no matter for u or for uh would be equal to l of uh minus wh so this term is zero
Dialogue: 0,00:07:37.220,00:07:37.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,yes
Dialogue: 0,00:07:37.460,00:07:50.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,uh i think the first term is still there right yeah this other term is zero yes
Dialogue: 0,00:07:50.660,00:07:58.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,right okay so what we have as a result of these two simplifications one simplification is
Dialogue: 0,00:07:58.820,00:08:07.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,a manipulation of this term one is manipulation of this term it becomes uh that if i copy these
Dialogue: 0,00:08:07.220,00:08:18.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,two here a of u minus wh u minus wh or the energy norm of u minus wh is going to be equal to so the
Dialogue: 0,00:08:18.500,00:08:28.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,first term is going to become a of u minus uh u minus uh so that's from here the other term is uh
Dialogue: 0,00:08:28.660,00:08:36.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,from from here right so plus this goes from here a of
Dialogue: 0,00:08:37.220,00:08:48.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,uh minus wh uh minus wh so remember we have coercivity which means this bilinear form is
Dialogue: 0,00:08:48.820,00:08:54.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,greater or equal to something squared to the norm of this guy squared so this has to be greater or
Dialogue: 0,00:08:54.980,00:09:05.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,equal to a of u minus uh u minus uh uh plus this coercivity constant
Dialogue: 0,00:09:07.220,00:09:19.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,right uh minus wh squared so what we're seeing is that so this is uh so this is the error right
Dialogue: 0,00:09:19.140,00:09:27.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,this is the error in the finite element solution and the error in the finite element solution
Dialogue: 0,00:09:29.380,00:09:36.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,is the energy norm of the solution
Dialogue: 0,00:09:37.220,00:09:42.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,of the error in the finite eminent solution is less or equal to
Dialogue: 0,00:09:42.840,00:09:45.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,basically is the smallest, it's smaller
Dialogue: 0,00:09:45.800,00:09:48.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,than the energy norm
Dialogue: 0,00:09:48.740,00:09:55.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,of any other approximation of u within the same finite dimensional space
Dialogue: 0,00:09:56.880,00:09:58.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,right so
Dialogue: 0,00:09:58.160,00:10:00.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,right so this is a
Dialogue: 0,00:10:00.120,00:10:01.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,if i
Dialogue: 0,00:10:01.500,00:10:05.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,if i ignore this term, this term is always greater than zero so i can
Dialogue: 0,00:10:05.160,00:10:06.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,i can keep
Dialogue: 0,00:10:06.180,00:10:13.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,just drop this term and still have the greater or equal
Dialogue: 0,00:10:15.040,00:10:17.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,for all
Dialogue: 0,00:10:17.080,00:10:19.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,w
Dialogue: 0,00:10:19.860,00:10:24.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we can see that the equality can only be obtained when u
Dialogue: 0,00:10:24.180,00:10:29.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,minus w is zero
Dialogue: 0,00:10:29.060,00:10:31.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,so not only
Dialogue: 0,00:10:31.360,00:10:32.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,u has the
Dialogue: 0,00:10:32.940,00:10:35.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,has the optimal error
Dialogue: 0,00:10:35.020,00:10:36.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,in the energy norm
Dialogue: 0,00:10:36.040,00:10:43.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,but it is the only member in the finite dimensional space that has that optimal error
Dialogue: 0,00:10:43.800,00:10:47.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,alright
Dialogue: 0,00:10:47.280,00:10:52.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,so finite element solution is the solution that optimizes, that minimizes the
Dialogue: 0,00:10:52.540,00:10:54.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,approximation error
Dialogue: 0,00:10:54.460,00:10:58.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,if the approximation error is expressed in terms of
Dialogue: 0,00:10:58.720,00:11:01.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,the energy norm
Dialogue: 0,00:11:01.320,00:11:05.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the energy norm is going to be specific to that bilinear form
