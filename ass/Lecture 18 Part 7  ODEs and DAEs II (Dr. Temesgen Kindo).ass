Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:05.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,But let's say I want to solve this algebraic equation, just finding roots, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:05.480,00:00:08.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,I want to solve u cubed is equal to 8 for u.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:09.240,00:00:13.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now the template is f of everything is 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:14.060,00:00:16.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,So then you have to write it in this template, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:16.920,00:00:24.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then what you will do is you specifically write u cubed minus 8, because that is going to be 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:24.720,00:00:26.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then you put your initial value.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:26.380,00:00:28.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's see how to solve this.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:28.200,00:00:37.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,File, new, model wizard.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:37.680,00:00:39.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is going to be a 0D problem.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:40.140,00:00:42.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,There is no special variation to it.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:43.040,00:00:45.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,I come to this, global ODAs and DAEs.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:46.600,00:00:47.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,I add this.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:48.140,00:00:49.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm going to solve a stationary problem.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:50.520,00:00:51.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm done.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:53.240,00:00:57.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, here I write I'm going to solve for u.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:58.200,00:01:02.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the equation is I'm not going to say u cubed is equal to 8.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:02.580,00:01:06.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,I have to write whatever it is needs to be set to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:07.440,00:01:10.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now u cubed minus 8.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:11.160,00:01:12.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,And what's the initial value?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:13.100,00:01:16.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well, for a stationary problem, that's meaningless.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:17.280,00:01:21.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,For time dependent problem, I mean, for time dependent problem, it's meaningful.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:22.340,00:01:25.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,But for a stationary problem, it's only a numerical item.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:25.980,00:01:26.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let me compute this.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:28.200,00:01:30.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is a reasonably simple problem, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:30.240,00:01:31.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,We even know the solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:32.000,00:01:35.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,But it's saying, we have to find a solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:35.900,00:01:37.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,What do you think is going on?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:42.100,00:01:42.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,Huh?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:44.100,00:01:44.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Anybody?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:45.840,00:01:52.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's think in terms of just real, whatever.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:52.440,00:01:52.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:52.580,00:01:56.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,If we talk, if we assume it's going to be a real solution.

Dialogue: 0,00:02:08.200,00:02:08.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:13.520,00:02:14.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:18.440,00:02:18.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:22.140,00:02:22.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:22.720,00:02:23.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.

Dialogue: 0,00:02:28.200,00:02:30.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,to change the integral value.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:30.200,00:02:31.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:31.200,00:02:34.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,You're the new expression in the class.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:34.200,00:02:37.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So anyway, let's assume we are solving this using the Newton
Dialogue: 0,00:02:37.200,00:02:39.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,method, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:39.200,00:02:41.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,If we are solving this with the Newton method,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:41.200,00:02:45.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,we're trying to form f of u is equal to 0 for u.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:45.200,00:02:48.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,We don't know how to approach this,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:48.200,00:02:52.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,but we can always state it, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:52.200,00:02:59.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is actually a question I always ask myself.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:59.200,00:03:02.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,When I run into a new numerical problem that I don't know how
Dialogue: 0,00:03:02.200,00:03:06.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,to deal with, you ask yourself, what would Taylor do?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:06.200,00:03:09.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Once I Google, what would Taylor do?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:09.200,00:03:12.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,And there are and one piece for what would Taylor do?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:12.200,00:03:15.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,But it's for Taylor Swift.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:15.200,00:03:18.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,That is a point that I know there would be for .
Dialogue: 0,00:03:18.200,00:03:21.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,But anyway, so the way you do it, you
Dialogue: 0,00:03:21.200,00:03:22.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,are trying to find.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:22.200,00:03:24.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,You are trying to find a distance, a displacement that
Dialogue: 0,00:03:24.200,00:03:26.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,will take you closer to your solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:26.200,00:03:31.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if you put the Taylor expansion of this,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:31.200,00:03:36.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,then you are going to have f prime of u delta u.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:36.200,00:03:38.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we ignore the I-order terms.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:38.200,00:03:43.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now if you set this to be 0 in a one-dimensional case,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:43.200,00:03:45.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean in a scalar problem, what you're getting
Dialogue: 0,00:03:45.200,00:03:51.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,is the distance you need to move on is going to be f of u
Dialogue: 0,00:03:51.200,00:03:52.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,over mu.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:52.200,00:03:56.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you're going to have f prime of u negative.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:56.200,00:04:01.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if f prime is 0, or if this is a scalar,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:01.200,00:04:04.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,your vector system of equations you are solving,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:04.200,00:04:07.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,f minus f, which is the residual, is going
Dialogue: 0,00:04:07.200,00:04:10.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,to be your Jacobian matrix like this.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:10.200,00:04:14.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if this is singular, you're going to run into a problem.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:14.200,00:04:16.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,And here we are solving u cubed minus 8.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:16.200,00:04:17.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,What is the root?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:17.200,00:04:18.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,The derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:18.200,00:04:20.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,3u squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:20.200,00:04:21.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Check it out.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:21.200,00:04:22.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:22.200,00:04:25.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's what we are getting here.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:25.200,00:04:32.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's change the initial value and recompute.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:32.200,00:04:37.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,And our solution here, if I evaluate, it's 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:37.200,00:04:41.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that was the problem with the initial starting point.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:41.200,00:04:45.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So all these ideas that you keep talking
Dialogue: 0,00:04:45.200,00:04:49.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,in your numerical analysis classes, they have consequences.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:49.200,00:04:56.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,And a lot of times when we have people difficulty using the software,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:56.200,00:05:00.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's because you miss things like this.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:00.200,00:05:04.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then we'll be like, hey, why isn't this working?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:04.200,00:05:05.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is really a simple problem.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:05.200,00:05:11.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,And you guys cannot solve this and pay me back.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:11.200,00:05:16.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Anyway, moving on.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:16.200,00:05:18.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Since Comsol doesn't distinguish in this interval,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:18.200,00:05:24.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,you don't have different interfaces for algebraic and global equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:24.200,00:05:30.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So before I actually go to differential equations,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:30.200,00:05:33.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,I want to talk a little bit about domain algebraic equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:33.200,00:05:35.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,What we solve now is a global algebraic equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:35.200,00:05:37.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,But let's say we want to solve a problem.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:37.200,00:05:40.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Instead of u cubed being equal to 8,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:40.200,00:05:45.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,you want to solve u cubed is equal to some function of location.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:45.200,00:05:46.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what is going to happen?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:46.200,00:05:50.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Every point is going to have its own solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:50.200,00:05:53.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,At every point, the problem is algebraic.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:53.200,00:05:58.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,But it is going to have different parameters.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:58.200,00:06:00.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in any problem like this,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:00.200,00:06:03.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,you're going to have an algebraic field equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:03.200,00:06:08.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,For example, when you are solving sometimes multiphysics problems,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:08.200,00:06:11.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,there will be some kind of dynamic constraints
Dialogue: 0,00:06:11.200,00:06:15.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,between different variables, some algebraic constraints.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:15.200,00:06:19.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,And sometimes you know that directly, one in terms of the other.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:19.200,00:06:25.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you have, let's say maybe you know p is some function of temperature
Dialogue: 0,00:06:25.200,00:06:27.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,and other quantity.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:27.200,00:06:30.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you know this, you can just directly type this.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:30.200,00:06:35.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,But most of the time, you have some implicit equation, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:35.200,00:06:37.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,p, d, whatever is of 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:37.200,00:06:42.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,And at every point, this algebraic relation has to be satisfied.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:42.200,00:06:44.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,But then every point has its own solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:44.200,00:06:50.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's what you use domain algebraic equations for instead of global.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:50.200,00:06:54.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Just like that, we also have global and domain ODEs.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:54.200,00:06:59.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's say we are solving this population projection problem,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:59.200,00:07:03.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,the local prey-predator equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:03.200,00:07:08.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Which one is the prey and which one is the predator in this equation?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:08.200,00:07:13.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Between u and v, if one was prey and one was predator.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:13.200,00:07:18.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Predator.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:18.200,00:07:21.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Look at the interaction terms.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:21.200,00:07:23.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Assuming all coefficients are positive,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:23.200,00:07:26.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,a1, b1, a2, b2 are all positive.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:26.200,00:07:28.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or non-negative at least.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:28.200,00:07:31.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,u is the prey.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:31.200,00:07:33.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,u is the prey, why would you say that?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:33.200,00:07:35.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because when u and v meet, it's...
Dialogue: 0,00:07:35.200,00:07:41.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, basically when u and v meet, it's u's damage and v's gain.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:41.200,00:07:46.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So u is the prey, the other one is the predator.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:46.200,00:07:52.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the way to specify this is we don't differentiate between algebraic and global equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:52.200,00:07:54.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,You use the same global equation interface.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:54.200,00:07:56.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,The only thing is...
Dialogue: 0,00:07:56.200,00:07:59.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,I already have a solved model for this.

Dialogue: 0,00:08:02.200,00:08:04.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,when you enter this equation,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:04.200,00:08:08.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,now instead of just being an algebraic equation, you are going to have derivatives.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:08.200,00:08:10.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Remember when we talked about derivative operators?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:10.200,00:08:12.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if I...
Dialogue: 0,00:08:12.200,00:08:15.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Here also you enter everything is equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:15.200,00:08:19.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if I want du over dt is equal to something,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:19.200,00:08:21.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,I would move the right-hand side to the left.

Dialogue: 0,00:08:43.200,00:08:47.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now if you have this,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:47.200,00:08:51.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,then you have to add the time-dependent solvers, specify the time you want,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:51.200,00:08:55.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,and you just solve that.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:55.200,00:08:59.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for example here what I get is for the initial values I started with,

Dialogue: 0,00:09:11.200,00:09:17.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,But the major point here is that the global differential and algebraic equations,

Dialogue: 0,00:10:07.200,00:10:12.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Still what we are having is ordinary differential equations at every point.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:12.200,00:10:17.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So here what we are assuming is there is no interaction between population at one point

Dialogue: 0,00:10:20.200,00:10:27.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So every point is independent of the neighbors.

Dialogue: 0,00:12:03.200,00:12:06.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,We prepared the presentation before.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:06.200,00:12:12.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Anyway, if you have migration, then we can assume...
Dialogue: 0,00:12:12.200,00:12:21.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,One thing to assume is people migrate from high concentrated areas to low concentrated areas.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:21.200,00:12:25.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Maybe if that is the effect, you will have diffusion.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:25.200,00:12:28.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,And you have an advection term in this equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:28.200,00:12:31.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now if you have migration where people want to run away from high concentration areas,
Dialogue: 0,00:12:31.200,00:12:39.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,you can have the advection term, the diffusion term.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:39.200,00:12:43.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,But can you have any advection, any reason for adding advection?
Dialogue: 0,00:12:43.200,00:12:49.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, what would it be?
Dialogue: 0,00:12:49.200,00:12:59.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, so in terms of population projection, population analysis problem,

Dialogue: 0,00:13:03.200,00:13:04.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,What would motivate...
Dialogue: 0,00:13:04.200,00:13:06.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Basically advection is...
Dialogue: 0,00:13:06.200,00:13:09.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Diffusion is you move based on the concentration, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:13:09.200,00:13:15.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Whereas advection is just a velocity irrespective of the concentration.

Dialogue: 0,00:13:32.200,00:13:36.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Remember the California boat rush, for example, right?
