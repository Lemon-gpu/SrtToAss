Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:05.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright, last lecture we discussed how to estimate the error in finite element solutions.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:06.440,00:00:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,How much error it was caused by limiting the space of solution from the infinite dimensional space
Dialogue: 0,00:00:14.000,00:00:17.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,in the weak form of the differential equation to a finite dimensional space,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:18.380,00:00:22.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,which we can represent as a linear combination of a few basis functions
Dialogue: 0,00:00:22.920,00:00:28.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,and derive a set of algebraic equations for the linear combination coefficients.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:28.300,00:00:34.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the error estimate we have looked at are mostly a priori error estimates
Dialogue: 0,00:00:34.580,00:00:43.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,because the precise form of the error is going to depend on the particular solution,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:43.920,00:00:45.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,not the approximate solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:47.260,00:00:51.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So finally, in the last lecture, we derived several facts.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:51.460,00:00:56.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,One is that in the energy norm, the finite element solution was the optimal
Dialogue: 0,00:00:56.660,00:00:59.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,in how much error it has.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:00.100,00:01:08.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And in both H1 and L2 norm, the finite element solution is optimal up to a certain factor,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:09.220,00:01:12.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,up to a certain finite factor that doesn't depend on the grid size.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:13.360,00:01:18.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,That enables us to bound the finite element solution error
Dialogue: 0,00:01:18.800,00:01:24.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,by one particular type of approximation, which is piecewise linear interpolant.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:26.660,00:01:34.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the precise error of the piecewise linear interpolant actually then depends on the curvature,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:35.220,00:01:40.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is the second order derivative of the actual solution, not the finite element solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:41.560,00:01:45.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,Therefore, that is a priori error estimate.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:47.040,00:01:50.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,The form of the error depends on the actual solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:50.920,00:01:55.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this lecture, we will talk about a posteriori error estimate,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:55.540,00:01:59.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,which we are going to derive a form of an error estimate
Dialogue: 0,00:01:59.800,00:02:05.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,that actually depends on not the real continuous solution, but the discrete solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:06.500,00:02:09.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,That is some error estimate we can actually compute.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:10.300,00:02:10.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:11.560,00:02:16.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in order to introduce that kind of a posteriori error estimate,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:17.480,00:02:22.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,the posteriori estimate cannot be actually applied to the entire solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:23.140,00:02:24.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,It can only be applied to the entire solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:24.820,00:02:24.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:24.840,00:02:24.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:24.900,00:02:24.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:24.920,00:02:24.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:24.980,00:02:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:25.000,00:02:25.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:25.020,00:02:25.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:25.040,00:02:25.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:25.300,00:02:25.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:25.540,00:02:25.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:25.900,00:02:27.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,By instance, we first need a form of a posteriori error.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:27.320,00:02:27.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:27.400,00:02:30.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,By instance, we first need a form of an error estimate.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:30.040,00:02:30.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?

Dialogue: 0,00:02:30.440,00:02:30.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:30.460,00:02:31.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, for instance, we used this producer.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:31.120,00:02:31.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:31.600,00:02:31.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:31.660,00:02:31.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:31.960,00:02:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:32.000,00:02:32.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:32.060,00:02:46.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,There is a
Dialogue: 0,00:02:47.300,00:02:47.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:51.500,00:02:55.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:55.000,00:02:57.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,where we get our final admin solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:58.680,00:03:03.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,What we're interested in is not usually the entire solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:04.720,00:03:10.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,We are interested in a particular final number of quantities
Dialogue: 0,00:03:10.120,00:03:13.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,computed from the solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:14.380,00:03:18.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,And here I'm going to write this as L0 of U.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:20.800,00:03:23.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,What are some examples of this L of U?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:23.260,00:03:29.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,In aerodynamics problems, this may be the lift or drag of an airplane.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:30.520,00:03:35.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,In heat transfer problems, if I'm interested in solving for a temperature field
Dialogue: 0,00:03:35.860,00:03:40.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,that concerns the damage due to heat to some material,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:40.800,00:03:46.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,I may be interested in the maximum temperature in a certain material.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:48.220,00:03:51.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So these are quantities I'm interested in.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:51.200,00:03:53.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is the quantities that...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:53.260,00:03:55.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,tells me why am I solving this PDE.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:56.620,00:04:01.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so that is L0 of U that, let's say, for example,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:01.060,00:04:03.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,give me just one single number.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:04.160,00:04:06.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,L0 itself is a linear function.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:07.720,00:04:09.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it is a linear...
Dialogue: 0,00:04:11.180,00:04:13.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,functional...
Dialogue: 0,00:04:14.780,00:04:16.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,of the solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:19.780,00:04:20.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:21.160,00:04:23.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the error estimate...
Dialogue: 0,00:04:23.260,00:04:35.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,should approximate the difference between L0 operated on the finite element solution
Dialogue: 0,00:04:35.260,00:04:40.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,minus the same functional operated on the real solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:41.200,00:04:43.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,So here I'm trying to estimate
Dialogue: 0,00:04:43.420,00:04:47.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,if I spent a million times more computation effort
Dialogue: 0,00:04:47.940,00:04:49.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,getting a much better approximation,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:50.480,00:04:53.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,how much difference does that make to my...
Dialogue: 0,00:04:53.260,00:04:55.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,quantity of interest?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:55.260,00:05:03.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,If the difference is minor, is more compared to, let's say, other uncertainties from the setup of the problem,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:03.680,00:05:05.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,let's say the material properties, etc.,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:05.680,00:05:11.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,then I shouldn't spend this additional effort solving the PDE to much more accuracy.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:11.200,00:05:14.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,But if the error turns out to be large,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:14.200,00:05:19.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,and it's large compared to other sources of uncertainty,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:19.200,00:05:22.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I have the computational resources, then I should spend...
Dialogue: 0,00:05:23.260,00:05:28.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,the computational time refining the grid and getting a more accurate solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:28.260,00:05:29.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:29.260,00:05:33.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is what we are trying to approximate.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:33.260,00:05:38.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the linearity of the output functional allows me to...
Dialogue: 0,00:05:38.260,00:05:42.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,say this is actually equal to L0 operated on...
Dialogue: 0,00:05:42.260,00:05:44.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,U-H minus U.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:44.260,00:05:45.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:45.260,00:05:47.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's simply linearity.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:49.260,00:05:51.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So how do I estimate that quantity?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:51.260,00:05:53.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,To estimate...
Dialogue: 0,00:05:53.260,00:05:58.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,that quantity, I'm going to introduce another equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:58.260,00:06:01.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm going to introduce what's called the adjoint equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:08.260,00:06:10.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Remember, what are the place...
Dialogue: 0,00:06:10.260,00:06:14.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,what is the place that a linear functional appeared before?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:14.260,00:06:17.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's the right-hand side of a weak form.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:17.260,00:06:19.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:19.260,00:06:23.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the trick in this a posteriori area estimate...
Dialogue: 0,00:06:23.260,00:06:28.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,is to introduce or invent another weak form...
Dialogue: 0,00:06:28.260,00:06:33.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,that uses this L0, which is a different linear functional...
Dialogue: 0,00:06:33.260,00:06:35.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,from the L in the differential equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:35.260,00:06:40.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to introduce another equation that uses this L0...
Dialogue: 0,00:06:40.260,00:06:42.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,as the right-hand side of the weak form.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:42.260,00:06:46.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Particularly, I'm going to introduce an adjoint equation that is A star,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:46.260,00:06:48.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is different from this A also.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:48.260,00:06:51.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm going to tell you what A star has to be a little bit later.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:51.260,00:06:56.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let me call this U hat being the solution of this different differential equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:56.260,00:07:01.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,And V has to equal to L0 of V.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:01.260,00:07:11.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,For all possible Vs, remember this L0 has to be operated on the difference between UH and U.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:11.260,00:07:17.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this V in this differential equation should belong to the space of XU.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:17.260,00:07:18.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:18.260,00:07:20.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's the space where U has to belong to.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:21.260,00:07:28.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the test space of this adjoint equation is the primal space,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:28.260,00:07:30.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,is the space of, is the solution space,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:30.260,00:07:37.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,the also called trial space of the original differential equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:37.260,00:07:39.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:39.260,00:07:48.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,And it turns out that my U hat, the solution...
Dialogue: 0,00:07:48.260,00:07:50.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,whose solution U hat should be in...
Dialogue: 0,00:07:51.260,00:08:00.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,the XV should be in the space of the test functions in the original differential equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:00.260,00:08:02.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:02.260,00:08:04.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So how is this going to be helpful?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:04.260,00:08:12.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's try to use the manually constructed differential equation
Dialogue: 0,00:08:12.260,00:08:15.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,to figure out how do I further derive this.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:15.260,00:08:18.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if I have this, then my...
Dialogue: 0,00:08:18.260,00:08:24.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,I know that for all V in this XU, this weak form is equal.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:24.260,00:08:31.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that allows me to substitute this particular UH minus U into V.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:31.260,00:08:38.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is going to give me A star of U hat and UH minus U.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:38.260,00:08:39.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:39.260,00:08:42.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:42.260,00:08:46.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now here comes to what this A star has to be.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:46.260,00:08:52.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the reason it's called the adjoint equation is that A star and the A in the original equation,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:52.260,00:08:55.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,they are adjoint operators.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:55.260,00:09:03.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So A star and A are so-called adjoint.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:03.260,00:09:14.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,In that the definition of adjoint is that A of U, V is exactly equal to A star of V and U.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:14.260,00:09:15.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,For...
Dialogue: 0,00:09:16.260,00:09:21.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,All pairs of U and V.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:21.260,00:09:24.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is U, this is V.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:24.260,00:09:29.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,If these As are matrices, what does adjoint mean?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:29.260,00:09:31.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,They're just transpose.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:31.260,00:09:32.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Exactly.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:32.260,00:09:33.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Exactly.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:33.260,00:09:38.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So A star in finite dimensional sense would be just transpose of A.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:38.260,00:09:39.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:39.260,00:09:44.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now we know that A star of U hat and UH minus U
Dialogue: 0,00:09:44.260,00:09:45.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,is equal to...
Dialogue: 0,00:09:46.260,00:09:56.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,A of UH minus U and U hat.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:56.260,00:09:59.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:59.260,00:10:04.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So here we use the original differential equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:04.260,00:10:14.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Before that we are going to expand it using the bilinearity of A.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:14.260,00:10:22.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So first of all, U hat is a member of XV.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:22.260,00:10:29.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So by the original differential equation, by this original differential equation, if V...
Dialogue: 0,00:10:29.260,00:10:39.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,If I substitute V by U hat, what I get is this is equal to L of what?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:39.260,00:10:40.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,U hat.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:40.260,00:10:42.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:42.260,00:10:43.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:43.260,00:10:55.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So therefore, this whole thing is equal to A of UH, U hat minus L of U hat.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:55.260,00:11:01.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or, so let's look at what is the consequence of this equality we derived.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:01.260,00:11:10.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,The error in the output linear functional, okay, is equal to the left-hand side minus
Dialogue: 0,00:11:10.260,00:11:11.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,right-hand side.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:11.260,00:11:15.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you look at the original equation, okay, this is the original equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:15.260,00:11:19.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Left-hand side is A of UV, right-hand side is L of V.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:19.260,00:11:24.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Here, this is A of UH and U hat.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:24.260,00:11:26.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is the right-hand side L of U hat.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:26.260,00:11:34.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the residual of the original differential equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:34.260,00:11:40.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,When I substitute the solution U by the finite dimension or finite elements,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:40.260,00:11:50.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,solution UH, and I substitute the V, the test function, by this solution of the adjoint
Dialogue: 0,00:11:50.260,00:11:53.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,equation, U hat.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:53.260,00:12:03.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, remember, this is just the A of UV minus L of V.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:03.260,00:12:05.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is A of UH of this.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:05.260,00:12:09.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,For V is particularly equal to L of V.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:09.260,00:12:17.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is particularly equal to U hat.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:17.260,00:12:20.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So why is this a posteriori error estimate?
Dialogue: 0,00:12:20.260,00:12:24.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because this formula involves UH, not U.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:24.260,00:12:25.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:12:25.260,00:12:28.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this formula is up to now exact.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:28.260,00:12:31.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,We make no approximation whatsoever.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:31.260,00:12:37.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,The only approximation we are going to make is to V, because here, V is still the exact
Dialogue: 0,00:12:37.260,00:12:38.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:38.260,00:12:42.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,The exact solution of the adjoint equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:42.260,00:12:43.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:12:43.260,00:12:51.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, we are going to solve V using numerical method and substitute that V into this error
Dialogue: 0,00:12:51.260,00:12:52.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,formula.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:52.260,00:12:53.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we get an error estimate.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:53.260,00:12:58.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean, it's an estimate because I'm solving a numerical approximation for V, not the exact
Dialogue: 0,00:12:58.260,00:12:59.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,V.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:59.260,00:13:04.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,If I have the exact V in some way, then I have an exact formula for the error.
