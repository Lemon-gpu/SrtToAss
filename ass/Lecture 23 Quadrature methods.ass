Dialogue: 0,00:05:22.000,00:05:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and talk about
Dialogue: 0,00:05:24.000,00:05:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,second kind equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:26.000,00:05:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'll tell you a little bit about

Dialogue: 0,00:05:30.000,00:05:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,but the end of this is gonna be a numerical method
Dialogue: 0,00:05:32.000,00:05:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,that uses the Gauss projector
Dialogue: 0,00:05:34.000,00:05:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,that we talked about last time
Dialogue: 0,00:05:36.000,00:05:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,to solve integral equations in 2D.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:38.000,00:05:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's a very effective technique,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:40.000,00:05:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,very widely used in practice,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:42.000,00:05:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,but also difficult to extend
Dialogue: 0,00:05:44.000,00:05:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,to three dimensions.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:46.000,00:05:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it isn't the only topic we talk about,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:48.000,00:05:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,but it is certainly an important one
Dialogue: 0,00:05:50.000,00:05:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and it's such an effective method in 2D.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:52.000,00:05:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's good that you know about it, even though it's not a good one.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:54.000,00:05:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Even though many of us are probably dealing with

Dialogue: 0,00:05:58.000,00:06:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,really make a lot of physical sense.

Dialogue: 0,00:06:02.000,00:06:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I'm just gonna remind you,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:04.000,00:06:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,you know, in 2D one of the things that makes it
Dialogue: 0,00:06:06.000,00:06:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,difficult to get a handle on
Dialogue: 0,00:06:08.000,00:06:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the physical insight is
Dialogue: 0,00:06:10.000,00:06:12.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the 2D problem means it's infinite in the third dimension
Dialogue: 0,00:06:12.000,00:06:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and that means
Dialogue: 0,00:06:14.000,00:06:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the Green's function you're familiar with
Dialogue: 0,00:06:16.000,00:06:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,with the potential produced by
Dialogue: 0,00:06:18.000,00:06:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,a point charge that dies like
Dialogue: 0,00:06:20.000,00:06:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,one over the distance turns into
Dialogue: 0,00:06:22.000,00:06:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,this log function that was supposed to
Dialogue: 0,00:06:24.000,00:06:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,do what you expect it to far away
Dialogue: 0,00:06:26.000,00:06:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,or nearby, but it is
Dialogue: 0,00:06:28.000,00:06:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the way you get for the
Dialogue: 0,00:06:30.000,00:06:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Green's function and what goes into the integral
Dialogue: 0,00:06:32.000,00:06:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,when we talk about calculating
Dialogue: 0,00:06:34.000,00:06:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the potentials from densities.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:36.000,00:06:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,We're thinking about the densities,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:38.000,00:06:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,it looks like points in the 2D space
Dialogue: 0,00:06:40.000,00:06:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,but in three dimensions it means that
Dialogue: 0,00:06:42.000,00:06:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,each point corresponds to a long,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:44.000,00:06:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,infinitely long, two-dimensional charge.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:46.000,00:06:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:48.000,00:06:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we're gonna talk a little bit about these 2D problems
Dialogue: 0,00:06:50.000,00:06:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,in particular, we're gonna say
Dialogue: 0,00:06:52.000,00:06:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,a little bit about, I'm just gonna remind you
Dialogue: 0,00:06:54.000,00:06:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,how we discretize,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:56.000,00:06:58.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,or one of the ways we talk about discretizing
Dialogue: 0,00:06:58.000,00:07:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,in 2D and then by the end of this lecture
Dialogue: 0,00:07:00.000,00:07:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we're gonna completely
Dialogue: 0,00:07:02.000,00:07:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,abandon this approach
Dialogue: 0,00:07:04.000,00:07:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,even though we'll come back to it when we talk about
Dialogue: 0,00:07:06.000,00:07:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,3D problems. So the idea
Dialogue: 0,00:07:08.000,00:07:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,was if you're doing 2D problems
Dialogue: 0,00:07:10.000,00:07:12.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,then your surface
Dialogue: 0,00:07:12.000,00:07:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,for the 2D problem,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:14.000,00:07:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,remember we're
Dialogue: 0,00:07:16.000,00:07:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,imagining in the
Dialogue: 0,00:07:18.000,00:07:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,2D problem that we have

Dialogue: 0,00:07:24.000,00:07:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,for the potential outside is equal to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:26.000,00:07:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,We have

Dialogue: 0,00:07:32.000,00:07:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,goes to zero
Dialogue: 0,00:07:34.000,00:07:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I apologize for the blinking
Dialogue: 0,00:07:36.000,00:07:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,when I think it's
Dialogue: 0,00:07:38.000,00:07:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,it keeps on persisting
Dialogue: 0,00:07:40.000,00:07:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'll try to do something about it.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:42.000,00:07:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the way we're gonna try to
Dialogue: 0,00:07:44.000,00:07:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,represent this solution
Dialogue: 0,00:07:46.000,00:07:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,is that we're gonna put densities
Dialogue: 0,00:07:48.000,00:07:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,on the surface
Dialogue: 0,00:07:52.000,00:07:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,a sigma

Dialogue: 0,00:07:58.000,00:08:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and this domain omega
Dialogue: 0,00:08:00.000,00:08:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,is our x-serial domain
Dialogue: 0,00:08:02.000,00:08:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we'll presume that we know
Dialogue: 0,00:08:04.000,00:08:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,something like
Dialogue: 0,00:08:06.000,00:08:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the potential that U

Dialogue: 0,00:08:12.000,00:08:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,is given.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:16.000,00:08:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we're gonna
Dialogue: 0,00:08:18.000,00:08:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,say that the potential is

Dialogue: 0,00:08:34.000,00:08:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,this potential. So that's our
Dialogue: 0,00:08:36.000,00:08:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,setup and the way we're gonna try to
Dialogue: 0,00:08:38.000,00:08:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,deal with this kind of exterior
Dialogue: 0,00:08:40.000,00:08:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,problem
Dialogue: 0,00:08:46.000,00:08:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,is we're gonna try to solve
Dialogue: 0,00:08:48.000,00:08:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,for the densities by making sure
Dialogue: 0,00:08:50.000,00:08:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,they produce the potentials or their normal
Dialogue: 0,00:08:52.000,00:08:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,derivatives and that's the given
Dialogue: 0,00:08:54.000,00:08:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,by the equation of boundary.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:56.000,00:08:58.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that meant we represented the

Dialogue: 0,00:09:00.000,00:09:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,surface and
Dialogue: 0,00:09:02.000,00:09:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we wrote down a system of equations

Dialogue: 0,00:10:26.000,00:10:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and you can think of that

Dialogue: 0,00:10:50.000,00:10:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so we move away from point chart

Dialogue: 0,00:10:54.000,00:10:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so we could set all this

Dialogue: 0,00:11:18.000,00:11:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we talked about another way
Dialogue: 0,00:11:20.000,00:11:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,of representing integral
Dialogue: 0,00:11:22.000,00:11:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and that was using this idea of
Dialogue: 0,00:11:24.000,00:11:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,a gauss quadrature algorithm
Dialogue: 0,00:11:26.000,00:11:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I want to remind you a little bit about this
Dialogue: 0,00:11:28.000,00:11:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so why don't I want to remind you about
Dialogue: 0,00:11:30.000,00:11:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the integral equations
Dialogue: 0,00:11:32.000,00:11:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,that was the set up
Dialogue: 0,00:11:34.000,00:11:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,these are the integral equations
Dialogue: 0,00:11:36.000,00:11:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I also wanted to remind you about a gauss quadrature
Dialogue: 0,00:11:38.000,00:11:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and gauss quadrature would say
Dialogue: 0,00:11:40.000,00:11:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I evaluate an integral by using
Dialogue: 0,00:11:42.000,00:11:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,a weighted combination with the integrands

Dialogue: 0,00:11:46.000,00:11:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so we have these two ideas
Dialogue: 0,00:11:52.000,00:11:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,what gauss quadrature says
Dialogue: 0,00:11:56.000,00:11:58.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,if I want to know the integral of
Dialogue: 0,00:11:58.000,00:12:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,some function of x
Dialogue: 0,00:12:00.000,00:12:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,integrated over dx
Dialogue: 0,00:12:02.000,00:12:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm going to represent it as the sum of
Dialogue: 0,00:12:04.000,00:12:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,weights
Dialogue: 0,00:12:06.000,00:12:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and points
Dialogue: 0,00:12:18.000,00:12:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so we're going to have points and weights
Dialogue: 0,00:12:20.000,00:12:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we're going to figure out the points and weights
Dialogue: 0,00:12:22.000,00:12:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,by matching higher order polynomial
Dialogue: 0,00:12:36.000,00:12:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so that was the idea of what we did last time
Dialogue: 0,00:12:38.000,00:12:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we talked about gauss quadrature
Dialogue: 0,00:12:40.000,00:12:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we said we're going to go ahead
Dialogue: 0,00:12:42.000,00:12:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we can figure out where the points are
Dialogue: 0,00:12:44.000,00:12:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the points are the roots of a polynomial
Dialogue: 0,00:12:50.000,00:12:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the points are
Dialogue: 0,00:12:52.000,00:12:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the weights were a solution to a system of equations
Dialogue: 0,00:13:02.000,00:13:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,that's what we did last time
Dialogue: 0,00:13:04.000,00:13:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so
Dialogue: 0,00:13:06.000,00:13:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,today we're going to put these two pictures together
Dialogue: 0,00:13:08.000,00:13:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,but we're going to have to go through a little bit of analysis first
Dialogue: 0,00:13:10.000,00:13:12.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so
Dialogue: 0,00:13:12.000,00:13:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we have an integral in the top picture
Dialogue: 0,00:13:14.000,00:13:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we're calculating the integral
Dialogue: 0,00:13:16.000,00:13:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,not by using points and weights
Dialogue: 0,00:13:18.000,00:13:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,what are we doing in the top case?
Dialogue: 0,00:13:20.000,00:13:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we're going to do this integral by assuming it's
Dialogue: 0,00:13:22.000,00:13:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the integrand is piecewise constant
Dialogue: 0,00:13:26.000,00:13:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,in the bottom case we're evaluating the integral
Dialogue: 0,00:13:28.000,00:13:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,by points and weights
Dialogue: 0,00:13:30.000,00:13:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,now the top one involves calculating
Dialogue: 0,00:13:32.000,00:13:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,integrals over lines
Dialogue: 0,00:13:34.000,00:13:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,which we can do at the bottom and do quadrature
Dialogue: 0,00:13:36.000,00:13:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,but the question is
Dialogue: 0,00:13:38.000,00:13:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so we have these points and weights
Dialogue: 0,00:13:40.000,00:13:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,doing the integral and we have this integral
Dialogue: 0,00:13:42.000,00:13:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,that we're representing with piecewise constant lines
Dialogue: 0,00:13:44.000,00:13:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,it seems like we ought to be able to marry these two
Dialogue: 0,00:13:46.000,00:13:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and in some cases you can
Dialogue: 0,00:13:48.000,00:13:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,talk a little bit about this quadrature thing
Dialogue: 0,00:13:50.000,00:13:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,because at the end of last time
Dialogue: 0,00:13:52.000,00:13:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,there's sort of a punchline about these algorithms
Dialogue: 0,00:13:54.000,00:13:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I wanted to look at them
Dialogue: 0,00:13:56.000,00:13:58.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,by looking at a few different functions
Dialogue: 0,00:13:58.000,00:14:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so we're going to look at just using
Dialogue: 0,00:14:00.000,00:14:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,this gauss quadrature scheme
Dialogue: 0,00:14:02.000,00:14:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,this idea of using points and weights
Dialogue: 0,00:14:04.000,00:14:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,where the points are the roots of a polynomial
Dialogue: 0,00:14:06.000,00:14:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the weights are the solutions of this linear system
Dialogue: 0,00:14:08.000,00:14:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,this does the exact for very high order polynomials
Dialogue: 0,00:14:10.000,00:14:12.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we're going to look at the
Dialogue: 0,00:14:12.000,00:14:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,error versus order
Dialogue: 0,00:14:14.000,00:14:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,for these test functions
Dialogue: 0,00:14:16.000,00:14:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,now as you look at these test functions
Dialogue: 0,00:14:18.000,00:14:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,you'll see that I have a function
Dialogue: 0,00:14:20.000,00:14:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,where x goes from 0 to 2 pi
Dialogue: 0,00:14:22.000,00:14:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I want to ask you about these functions
Dialogue: 0,00:14:24.000,00:14:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,what can you guess about these functions
Dialogue: 0,00:14:26.000,00:14:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,what do you know about them
Dialogue: 0,00:14:28.000,00:14:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,before I start writing down the plots
Dialogue: 0,00:14:30.000,00:14:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,obviously I'm picking these five functions
Dialogue: 0,00:14:32.000,00:14:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,because they're going to do something different
Dialogue: 0,00:14:34.000,00:14:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,with these different quadrature schemes
Dialogue: 0,00:14:36.000,00:14:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I want to point at that
Dialogue: 0,00:14:38.000,00:14:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and make one additional point
Dialogue: 0,00:14:40.000,00:14:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,just as a reminder
Dialogue: 0,00:14:42.000,00:14:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,of what we did last time
Dialogue: 0,00:14:44.000,00:14:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so what can you tell me about
Dialogue: 0,00:14:46.000,00:14:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the derivatives of these functions
Dialogue: 0,00:14:48.000,00:14:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,do any of them have funny behaviors
Dialogue: 0,00:14:50.000,00:14:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,when you start taking their derivatives
Dialogue: 0,00:14:52.000,00:14:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so what about the first one
Dialogue: 0,00:14:54.000,00:14:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,f1, what can you tell me about the derivative of that
Dialogue: 0,00:14:56.000,00:15:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,in particular as we go through 0
Dialogue: 0,00:15:00.000,00:15:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,oh sorry
Dialogue: 0,00:15:02.000,00:15:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,x goes from 0 to pi
Dialogue: 0,00:15:04.000,00:15:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,f1 of x is
Dialogue: 0,00:15:06.000,00:15:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,what happens to it
Dialogue: 0,00:15:08.000,00:15:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,maybe a divergent point
Dialogue: 0,00:15:10.000,00:15:12.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,somewhere in between
Dialogue: 0,00:15:12.000,00:15:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,yeah remember the score where you take the derivative
Dialogue: 0,00:15:14.000,00:15:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the derivative is something to the minus one half
Dialogue: 0,00:15:16.000,00:15:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,which means it blows something
Dialogue: 0,00:15:18.000,00:15:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,up when the argument is 0
Dialogue: 0,00:15:20.000,00:15:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,which it will do
Dialogue: 0,00:15:28.000,00:15:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so we're going to look at some of these functions
Dialogue: 0,00:15:30.000,00:15:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm going to plot them first
Dialogue: 0,00:15:32.000,00:15:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then I'm going to ask you about the quadrature of each of these
Dialogue: 0,00:15:34.000,00:15:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so here are all these functions
Dialogue: 0,00:15:36.000,00:15:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,on this interval of 0 to 2 pi
Dialogue: 0,00:15:38.000,00:15:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and it just so happens
Dialogue: 0,00:15:40.000,00:15:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I picked some of them
Dialogue: 0,00:15:42.000,00:15:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,this one with the square root
Dialogue: 0,00:15:44.000,00:15:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,you can see which one is the square root
Dialogue: 0,00:15:46.000,00:15:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,which color is it
Dialogue: 0,00:15:48.000,00:15:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,can you all see
Dialogue: 0,00:15:50.000,00:15:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,which one is this one
Dialogue: 0,00:15:52.000,00:15:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,that is the square root function
Dialogue: 0,00:15:54.000,00:15:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the one that does this
Dialogue: 0,00:15:56.000,00:15:58.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,that's the blue one
Dialogue: 0,00:15:58.000,00:16:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,it was x minus pi
Dialogue: 0,00:16:00.000,00:16:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we go from
Dialogue: 0,00:16:02.000,00:16:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,x equals 0 to 2 pi
Dialogue: 0,00:16:04.000,00:16:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so the argument to the square root
Dialogue: 0,00:16:06.000,00:16:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,was going from minus pi to pi
Dialogue: 0,00:16:08.000,00:16:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,what about these other functions
Dialogue: 0,00:16:10.000,00:16:12.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so they all have
Dialogue: 0,00:16:12.000,00:16:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,somewhat different properties
Dialogue: 0,00:16:14.000,00:16:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,they all look a little smoother
Dialogue: 0,00:16:16.000,00:16:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,but they're not the same
Dialogue: 0,00:16:18.000,00:16:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,but there are going to be some interesting things about them
Dialogue: 0,00:16:20.000,00:16:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we're going to look at
Dialogue: 0,00:16:22.000,00:16:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,just doing the quadrature algorithm
Dialogue: 0,00:16:24.000,00:16:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I'm going to compare it to
Dialogue: 0,00:16:26.000,00:16:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,this is what's called the trapezoidal rule
Dialogue: 0,00:16:28.000,00:16:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so the trapezoidal rule was
Dialogue: 0,00:16:30.000,00:16:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the midpoint rule
Dialogue: 0,00:16:32.000,00:16:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so you use points and weights
Dialogue: 0,00:16:34.000,00:16:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and it turns out when we're doing something like 0 to 2 pi
Dialogue: 0,00:16:36.000,00:16:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we're kind of at these endpoints
Dialogue: 0,00:16:38.000,00:16:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we're using a half
Dialogue: 0,00:16:40.000,00:16:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we can either shift around or use half weights on the end
Dialogue: 0,00:16:42.000,00:16:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's equivalent
Dialogue: 0,00:16:44.000,00:16:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we're going to use that particular approach
Dialogue: 0,00:16:46.000,00:16:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,to doing this, the trapezoidal rule
Dialogue: 0,00:16:48.000,00:16:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then we're also going to do
Dialogue: 0,00:16:50.000,00:16:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Gaussian quadrature
Dialogue: 0,00:16:52.000,00:16:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we're just going to pick it for a very high limit
Dialogue: 0,00:16:54.000,00:16:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so trap convergence
Dialogue: 0,00:16:56.000,00:16:58.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,that was the second order method
Dialogue: 0,00:16:58.000,00:17:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we use the trapezoidal rule, we use the midpoints
Dialogue: 0,00:17:00.000,00:17:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we expect for all those functions
Dialogue: 0,00:17:02.000,00:17:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,to go down, what do you expect the error for it to be
Dialogue: 0,00:17:04.000,00:17:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,as you increase the number of points
Dialogue: 0,00:17:06.000,00:17:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,if I increase the number of points
Dialogue: 0,00:17:08.000,00:17:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,by an order of magnitude
Dialogue: 0,00:17:10.000,00:17:12.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,what do I expect the error to do
Dialogue: 0,00:17:12.000,00:17:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,if I use 10 times as many points
Dialogue: 0,00:17:14.000,00:17:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,what's the error in the interval going to be
Dialogue: 0,00:17:16.000,00:17:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so again
Dialogue: 0,00:17:18.000,00:17:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm just looking to see how accurately I've computed this integral
Dialogue: 0,00:17:20.000,00:17:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,for each of those test functions
Dialogue: 0,00:17:22.000,00:17:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and all of them
Dialogue: 0,00:17:24.000,00:17:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,behave roughly
Dialogue: 0,00:17:28.000,00:17:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,like the error is second order
Dialogue: 0,00:17:30.000,00:17:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I just use 10 times as many points
Dialogue: 0,00:17:32.000,00:17:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the error drops by a factor of 100
Dialogue: 0,00:17:34.000,00:17:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,that's what you'd expect from the trapezoidal rule
Dialogue: 0,00:17:36.000,00:17:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,this midpoint rule
Dialogue: 0,00:17:38.000,00:17:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,one of them doesn't do that
Dialogue: 0,00:17:40.000,00:17:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,guess which one it is
Dialogue: 0,00:17:46.000,00:17:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,well alright two of them do it
Dialogue: 0,00:17:48.000,00:17:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,one of them does worse
Dialogue: 0,00:17:50.000,00:17:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and one of them does much better
Dialogue: 0,00:17:52.000,00:17:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,one that somebody mentioned
Dialogue: 0,00:17:54.000,00:17:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the one that does much better is the periodic function
Dialogue: 0,00:17:56.000,00:17:58.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,there's something about the trapezoidal rule
Dialogue: 0,00:17:58.000,00:18:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the periodic function
Dialogue: 0,00:18:00.000,00:18:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so we're going to come back to that at the very end of today's class
Dialogue: 0,00:18:02.000,00:18:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,this one that does worse
Dialogue: 0,00:18:04.000,00:18:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,which one is it
Dialogue: 0,00:18:06.000,00:18:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,let me go back and look at those curves again
Dialogue: 0,00:18:08.000,00:18:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,which of these curves do you think
Dialogue: 0,00:18:10.000,00:18:12.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,didn't get that kind of second order convergence
Dialogue: 0,00:18:14.000,00:18:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,which one would you expect to not do very well
Dialogue: 0,00:18:16.000,00:18:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,with the midpoint rule
Dialogue: 0,00:18:18.000,00:18:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the square root one
Dialogue: 0,00:18:20.000,00:18:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,yeah the square root one because it has this derivative
Dialogue: 0,00:18:22.000,00:18:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so it's a continuous function
Dialogue: 0,00:18:24.000,00:18:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,but its derivative goes to infinity
Dialogue: 0,00:18:26.000,00:18:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and so the slope
Dialogue: 0,00:18:28.000,00:18:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,as you go into where the square root shows up
Dialogue: 0,00:18:30.000,00:18:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,goes to infinity
Dialogue: 0,00:18:32.000,00:18:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and that even messes up a simple midpoint rule
Dialogue: 0,00:18:34.000,00:18:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,what about
Dialogue: 0,00:18:36.000,00:18:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the four-in-a-von
Dialogue: 0,00:18:38.000,00:18:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so that was the trapezoidal rule
Dialogue: 0,00:18:40.000,00:18:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we don't understand why for the periodic function
Dialogue: 0,00:18:42.000,00:18:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,it does this very fast convergence
Dialogue: 0,00:18:44.000,00:18:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I'm not going to necessarily give you all the details
Dialogue: 0,00:18:46.000,00:18:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,of why that's the case
Dialogue: 0,00:18:48.000,00:18:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,but its second order convergence
Dialogue: 0,00:18:50.000,00:18:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,is sort of what we expect from all these functions
Dialogue: 0,00:18:52.000,00:18:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,now I'm going to try using the Gauss quadrature
Dialogue: 0,00:18:54.000,00:18:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,where we pick the points and weights
Dialogue: 0,00:18:56.000,00:18:58.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,to get the optimal convergence
Dialogue: 0,00:18:58.000,00:19:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,what do you think is going to change in these curves
Dialogue: 0,00:19:00.000,00:19:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,what are they going to look like
Dialogue: 0,00:19:04.000,00:19:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,are they all going to get better
Dialogue: 0,00:19:12.000,00:19:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so here are the Gauss and quadrature points and weights
Dialogue: 0,00:19:14.000,00:19:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so for this interval
Dialogue: 0,00:19:16.000,00:19:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,you can see the points
Dialogue: 0,00:19:18.000,00:19:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,are spread out in the center
Dialogue: 0,00:19:20.000,00:19:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and more packed together near the sides
Dialogue: 0,00:19:22.000,00:19:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the weights also have this non-uniformity
Dialogue: 0,00:19:24.000,00:19:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so they're spread out more in the center
Dialogue: 0,00:19:26.000,00:19:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and they're more heavily weighted in the center
Dialogue: 0,00:19:28.000,00:19:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,they're more tightly packed in the ends
Dialogue: 0,00:19:30.000,00:19:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and they're weighted less heavily in the ends
Dialogue: 0,00:19:32.000,00:19:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so if we take those points and weights
Dialogue: 0,00:19:34.000,00:19:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,for this is the Gauss-Ludon theorem
Dialogue: 0,00:19:36.000,00:19:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then use that
Dialogue: 0,00:19:38.000,00:19:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we see the following curves
Dialogue: 0,00:19:44.000,00:19:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,y
Dialogue: 0,00:19:46.000,00:19:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so obviously
Dialogue: 0,00:19:48.000,00:19:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I didn't pick those functions at random
Dialogue: 0,00:19:50.000,00:19:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,because you pick five
Dialogue: 0,00:19:52.000,00:19:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,functions out of a bag
Dialogue: 0,00:19:54.000,00:19:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the chance that they will produce
Dialogue: 0,00:19:56.000,00:19:58.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,five different convergence curves
Dialogue: 0,00:19:58.000,00:20:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,for Gauss and Ludonga
Dialogue: 0,00:20:00.000,00:20:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,that's a very low probability
Dialogue: 0,00:20:02.000,00:20:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so I've obviously
Dialogue: 0,00:20:04.000,00:20:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,picked them very carefully
Dialogue: 0,00:20:06.000,00:20:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,what's different about those functions
Dialogue: 0,00:20:08.000,00:20:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,that might explain this behavior
Dialogue: 0,00:20:10.000,00:20:12.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so what do we know
Dialogue: 0,00:20:12.000,00:20:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,should be true about Gauss-Ludonga
Dialogue: 0,00:20:14.000,00:20:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,how fast should it converge
Dialogue: 0,00:20:16.000,00:20:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,should it go like
Dialogue: 0,00:20:18.000,00:20:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,if I increase the points by
Dialogue: 0,00:20:20.000,00:20:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,an order of magnitude
Dialogue: 0,00:20:22.000,00:20:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,do I affect
Dialogue: 0,00:20:24.000,00:20:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,is it like n squared
Dialogue: 0,00:20:26.000,00:20:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,is it like n cubed
Dialogue: 0,00:20:28.000,00:20:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,is it second order, third order, fourth order
Dialogue: 0,00:20:30.000,00:20:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,which of these curves do you expect to be like
Dialogue: 0,00:20:32.000,00:20:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the Gaussian Legendre
Dialogue: 0,00:20:34.000,00:20:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,based on what we talked about last time
Dialogue: 0,00:20:36.000,00:20:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,yeah
Dialogue: 0,00:20:38.000,00:20:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,to rapidly
Dialogue: 0,00:20:40.000,00:20:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,these two very rapidly decaying ones
Dialogue: 0,00:20:42.000,00:20:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,that's spectral convergence
Dialogue: 0,00:20:44.000,00:20:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,this is a log plot of the error
Dialogue: 0,00:20:46.000,00:20:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,versus number of points
Dialogue: 0,00:20:48.000,00:20:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so if you look at the log plot
Dialogue: 0,00:20:50.000,00:20:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the Gauss-Ludonga
Dialogue: 0,00:20:52.000,00:20:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's spectrally accurate
Dialogue: 0,00:20:54.000,00:20:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,which means it has a curve that goes
Dialogue: 0,00:20:56.000,00:20:58.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,faster and faster and faster
Dialogue: 0,00:20:58.000,00:21:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and that was true for only two of the functions
Dialogue: 0,00:21:00.000,00:21:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and not these other three
Dialogue: 0,00:21:02.000,00:21:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,what was wrong with those other three
Dialogue: 0,00:21:04.000,00:21:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and why did they have three different convergence rates
Dialogue: 0,00:21:08.000,00:21:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so how did we get the error estimate
Dialogue: 0,00:21:10.000,00:21:12.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,for Gauss-Ludonga last time
Dialogue: 0,00:21:12.000,00:21:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,what technique did we use
Dialogue: 0,00:21:14.000,00:21:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Taylor series
Dialogue: 0,00:21:16.000,00:21:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Taylor series counts on
Dialogue: 0,00:21:18.000,00:21:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the derivatives being
Dialogue: 0,00:21:20.000,00:21:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,bounded
Dialogue: 0,00:21:22.000,00:21:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,now let's go back and look at those functions
Dialogue: 0,00:21:24.000,00:21:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,now alright
Dialogue: 0,00:21:26.000,00:21:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so maybe the square root one
Dialogue: 0,00:21:28.000,00:21:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so you can figure out
Dialogue: 0,00:21:30.000,00:21:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the square root one with that cusp there
Dialogue: 0,00:21:32.000,00:21:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,that's probably the one that's really converging slowly
Dialogue: 0,00:21:34.000,00:21:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,but what about the others
Dialogue: 0,00:21:36.000,00:21:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the others look pretty smooth
Dialogue: 0,00:21:38.000,00:21:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,then you have to look at the analytic form for them
Dialogue: 0,00:21:40.000,00:21:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and you can see the game on play
Dialogue: 0,00:21:42.000,00:21:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I have x to the one half
Dialogue: 0,00:21:44.000,00:21:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,you take one derivative and you get x to the minus
Dialogue: 0,00:21:46.000,00:21:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,one half and that blows up
Dialogue: 0,00:21:48.000,00:21:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,you take one derivative and you get x to the one half
Dialogue: 0,00:21:50.000,00:21:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,take a second derivative and what happens to the derivative
Dialogue: 0,00:21:52.000,00:21:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,what happens to the second derivative
Dialogue: 0,00:21:54.000,00:21:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,for the second function
Dialogue: 0,00:21:56.000,00:21:58.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,blows up two in the end
Dialogue: 0,00:21:58.000,00:22:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,what about the third function
Dialogue: 0,00:22:00.000,00:22:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,how many derivatives do you get to take before it blows up
Dialogue: 0,00:22:02.000,00:22:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,you take two and the third derivative blows up
Dialogue: 0,00:22:04.000,00:22:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so now we go back to these functions
Dialogue: 0,00:22:06.000,00:22:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and you can see which is which
Dialogue: 0,00:22:08.000,00:22:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,square root function
Dialogue: 0,00:22:10.000,00:22:12.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,three halves function

Dialogue: 0,00:22:14.000,00:22:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,right
Dialogue: 0,00:22:16.000,00:22:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so you can see that the derivative is two
Dialogue: 0,00:22:18.000,00:22:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,however many derivatives you have
Dialogue: 0,00:22:20.000,00:22:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,that don't blow up
Dialogue: 0,00:22:22.000,00:22:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,is the order of convergence you get with Gauss-Lavigne curve
Dialogue: 0,00:22:24.000,00:22:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and if the function is infinitely continuously differentiable
Dialogue: 0,00:22:26.000,00:22:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,you get this curve
Dialogue: 0,00:22:28.000,00:22:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so you get this curve
Dialogue: 0,00:22:30.000,00:22:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and your function is really smooth
Dialogue: 0,00:22:32.000,00:22:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,when you have a derivative discontinuity
Dialogue: 0,00:22:34.000,00:22:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,a second derivative discontinuity
Dialogue: 0,00:22:36.000,00:22:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,a third derivative discontinuity
Dialogue: 0,00:22:38.000,00:22:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and all is lost in these methods
Dialogue: 0,00:22:40.000,00:22:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so the really great methods
Dialogue: 0,00:22:42.000,00:22:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,where your functions have to be really c infinitive
Dialogue: 0,00:22:44.000,00:22:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,they have to be continuously differentiable
Dialogue: 0,00:22:46.000,00:22:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and if they are
Dialogue: 0,00:22:48.000,00:22:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the two functions
Dialogue: 0,00:22:50.000,00:22:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the one that was periodic
Dialogue: 0,00:22:52.000,00:22:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the one that is infinitely continuous
Dialogue: 0,00:22:54.000,00:22:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and differentiable but not periodic
Dialogue: 0,00:22:56.000,00:22:58.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,both of them have the same function
Dialogue: 0,00:22:58.000,00:23:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,that was just a reminder
Dialogue: 0,00:23:00.000,00:23:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,ok so
Dialogue: 0,00:23:02.000,00:23:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we now have a couple things
Dialogue: 0,00:23:04.000,00:23:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we have a method for solving

Dialogue: 0,00:23:12.000,00:23:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then solving for
Dialogue: 0,00:23:14.000,00:23:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the weight
Dialogue: 0,00:23:16.000,00:23:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,or how we can solve

Dialogue: 0,00:23:20.000,00:23:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we can use that to discretize
Dialogue: 0,00:23:22.000,00:23:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,in 2D and solve
Dialogue: 0,00:23:24.000,00:23:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,an exterior Laplace problem
Dialogue: 0,00:23:26.000,00:23:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we're going to talk
Dialogue: 0,00:23:28.000,00:23:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,a little bit about

Dialogue: 0,00:23:34.000,00:23:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,then the second thing we have
Dialogue: 0,00:23:36.000,00:23:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,is this other way of calculating integrals
Dialogue: 0,00:23:38.000,00:23:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,which maybe we could use to calculate
Dialogue: 0,00:23:40.000,00:23:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,those line charges
Dialogue: 0,00:23:42.000,00:23:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and

Dialogue: 0,00:24:10.000,00:24:12.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,to do the problem set
Dialogue: 0,00:24:12.000,00:24:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,you can probably do it there and get checked off
Dialogue: 0,00:24:14.000,00:24:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then you won't have anything to hand in
Dialogue: 0,00:24:16.000,00:24:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so we're trying to make it so you get a chance to play with it
Dialogue: 0,00:24:18.000,00:24:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,these ideas but not
Dialogue: 0,00:24:20.000,00:24:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,put a lot of extra work on your queue
Dialogue: 0,00:24:22.000,00:24:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so I want to talk about
Dialogue: 0,00:24:24.000,00:24:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,trying to marry these together
Dialogue: 0,00:24:26.000,00:24:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I want to talk about it in the context
Dialogue: 0,00:24:28.000,00:24:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,of thinking about certain kinds of equations
Dialogue: 0,00:24:30.000,00:24:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we'll
Dialogue: 0,00:24:32.000,00:24:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,dig into this
Dialogue: 0,00:24:34.000,00:24:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,in a little more detail next week
Dialogue: 0,00:24:36.000,00:24:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we'll talk about
Dialogue: 0,00:24:38.000,00:24:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,some more of the details of this
Dialogue: 0,00:24:40.000,00:24:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,but for the moment I want to just get at this idea
Dialogue: 0,00:24:42.000,00:24:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,of the difference between first and second
Dialogue: 0,00:24:44.000,00:24:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,kind equations
Dialogue: 0,00:24:46.000,00:24:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then we'll do something on second kind equations
Dialogue: 0,00:24:48.000,00:24:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so here's one
Dialogue: 0,00:24:50.000,00:24:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,one
Dialogue: 0,00:24:52.000,00:24:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,d representation of an integral equation

Dialogue: 0,00:25:12.000,00:25:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so
Dialogue: 0,00:25:14.000,00:25:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we want to calculate the density
Dialogue: 0,00:25:16.000,00:25:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we're given a potential and we want to compute

Dialogue: 0,00:25:24.000,00:25:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so how do we do that
Dialogue: 0,00:25:26.000,00:25:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,well we do piecewise constant centroid
Dialogue: 0,00:25:28.000,00:25:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,collocation

Dialogue: 0,00:25:38.000,00:25:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so
Dialogue: 0,00:25:42.000,00:25:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the piecewise constant centroid collocation
Dialogue: 0,00:25:44.000,00:25:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,says we

Dialogue: 0,00:25:48.000,00:25:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we're going to construct

Dialogue: 0,00:29:48.000,00:29:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,no

Dialogue: 0,00:29:54.000,00:29:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,all the other terms it's fine
Dialogue: 0,00:29:56.000,00:29:58.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so we can use gauss quadrature
Dialogue: 0,00:29:58.000,00:30:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,or you could probably do that one more time
Dialogue: 0,00:30:00.000,00:30:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,ok so we calculate these integrals
Dialogue: 0,00:30:02.000,00:30:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,then we have this charge density representation
Dialogue: 0,00:30:04.000,00:30:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so we're representing the density
Dialogue: 0,00:30:06.000,00:30:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,with a weighted combination of piecewise constants
Dialogue: 0,00:30:08.000,00:30:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so we've got a piecewise constant
Dialogue: 0,00:30:10.000,00:30:12.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and density representation
Dialogue: 0,00:30:12.000,00:30:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we can go ahead and plug it into the integral
Dialogue: 0,00:30:14.000,00:30:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,where we get
Dialogue: 0,00:30:16.000,00:30:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,for this collocation discretization
Dialogue: 0,00:30:18.000,00:30:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we get
Dialogue: 0,00:30:20.000,00:30:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,all these entries
Dialogue: 0,00:30:22.000,00:30:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we have each one of the entries in the matrix
Dialogue: 0,00:30:24.000,00:30:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,takes us from one density
Dialogue: 0,00:30:26.000,00:30:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,to one potential
Dialogue: 0,00:30:28.000,00:30:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so we have one column for each density value
Dialogue: 0,00:30:30.000,00:30:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,that's taking the jth density
Dialogue: 0,00:30:32.000,00:30:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and calculating its potential
Dialogue: 0,00:30:34.000,00:30:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,at all the collocation points
Dialogue: 0,00:30:36.000,00:30:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we have one row for each collocation point
Dialogue: 0,00:30:38.000,00:30:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,that's the contribution of every density
Dialogue: 0,00:30:40.000,00:30:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,to a particular collocation point
Dialogue: 0,00:30:42.000,00:30:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so if we imagine
Dialogue: 0,00:30:44.000,00:30:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we have all these entries
Dialogue: 0,00:30:46.000,00:30:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we have these densities
Dialogue: 0,00:30:48.000,00:30:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we have one collocation point
Dialogue: 0,00:30:50.000,00:30:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,they all have to contribute to the collocation point
Dialogue: 0,00:30:58.000,00:31:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,all these densities
Dialogue: 0,00:31:02.000,00:31:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so this is one row
Dialogue: 0,00:31:06.000,00:31:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and this is one column
Dialogue: 0,00:31:12.000,00:31:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so you can keep in mind those pictures
Dialogue: 0,00:31:14.000,00:31:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,one column says all the dead points
Dialogue: 0,00:31:16.000,00:31:24.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,one density contributes to all� lou
Dialogue: 0,00:31:24.040,00:31:25.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,one row, all the densities contribute to all the collocation points
Dialogue: 0,00:31:25.300,00:31:26.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,one column, one density contributes to all the collocation points
Dialogue: 0,00:31:26.600,00:31:27.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,and one row all the density contribute to one collocation points
Dialogue: 0,00:31:27.520,00:31:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,a lot
Dialogue: 0,00:31:28.000,00:31:33.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,so that's what the matrix looks like
Dialogue: 0,00:31:33.700,00:31:37.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,and now we start to refine the discretization
Dialogue: 0,00:31:37.240,00:31:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so we have this integral
Dialogue: 0,00:31:40.000,00:31:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we break it up into n sections
Dialogue: 0,00:31:42.000,00:31:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we break it up to 2n sections
Dialogue: 0,00:31:44.000,00:31:45.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,we break it up to 4n sections
Dialogue: 0,00:31:45.100,00:31:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we break it up communauté sent all the means into a structure
Dialogue: 0,00:31:46.000,00:31:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And because we're so used to this, we expect that as we increase the number of sections,
Dialogue: 0,00:31:52.000,00:31:53.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the answer should get better.
Dialogue: 0,00:31:53.000,00:31:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,We should converge to the correct solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:31:56.000,00:31:59.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that isn't actually what happens.
Dialogue: 0,00:31:59.000,00:32:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,When you solve this first kind integral equation and you refine the discretization, the answers
Dialogue: 0,00:32:06.000,00:32:11.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,actually get worse.
Dialogue: 0,00:32:11.000,00:32:13.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Why is that?
Dialogue: 0,00:32:13.000,00:32:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,What's happening in this problem that causes that to occur?
Dialogue: 0,00:32:18.000,00:32:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well, it turns out that's just true of first kind integral equations generally.
Dialogue: 0,00:32:25.000,00:32:27.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,We're going to go back and look at that a little bit more carefully, although we're
Dialogue: 0,00:32:27.000,00:32:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,not going to focus on it too much today.
Dialogue: 0,00:32:30.000,00:32:33.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,But we're going to look at another type of equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:32:33.000,00:32:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the first kind equation is, I know the output of an integral and I want to figure
Dialogue: 0,00:32:38.000,00:32:39.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,out its input.
Dialogue: 0,00:32:39.000,00:32:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I know the potential, I want to figure out the density.
Dialogue: 0,00:32:42.000,00:32:43.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:32:43.000,00:32:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So there are many integral equations that turn out, come up with a different form in
Dialogue: 0,00:32:48.000,00:32:55.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,which you know the potential and the density shows up both inside and outside the integral.
Dialogue: 0,00:32:55.000,00:33:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,That is, the density shows up directly and also inside the integral.
Dialogue: 0,00:33:00.000,00:33:03.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,This equation is called the second kind equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:33:03.000,00:33:07.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So first kind means the density shows up only in the integral.
Dialogue: 0,00:33:07.000,00:33:12.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Second kind means it shows up in two ways, inside and outside the integral.
Dialogue: 0,00:33:12.000,00:33:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's a very simple equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:33:14.000,00:33:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,You just need to look at it from a different perspective.
Dialogue: 0,00:33:16.000,00:33:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,What do I mean by this?
Dialogue: 0,00:33:18.000,00:33:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,You can just look at it in a different perspective.
Dialogue: 0,00:33:20.000,00:33:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,But it's a case of a different kind of equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:33:22.000,00:33:23.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what about this equation?
Dialogue: 0,00:33:23.000,00:33:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,What's different?
Dialogue: 0,00:33:24.000,00:33:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we go through and we say, oh, all right, we'll use our piecewise constant centroid
Dialogue: 0,00:33:25.000,00:33:29.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,collocation method, even though in the first kind case it produced a method that, as we
Dialogue: 0,00:33:29.000,00:33:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,refine the discretization, the answers did not convert.
Dialogue: 0,00:33:30.000,00:33:31.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,They got worse.
Dialogue: 0,00:33:31.000,00:33:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,But we're going to do it anyway and see if it works for these kinds of equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:33:36.000,00:33:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And what we see is there's one extra piece to this.
Dialogue: 0,00:33:40.000,00:33:41.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:33:41.000,00:33:47.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,to this, which is because the density shows up outside, as well as inside the integral
Dialogue: 0,00:33:47.340,00:33:53.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,equation, we see this sigma ni, the self-term, showing up along with the summation.
Dialogue: 0,00:33:53.560,00:33:57.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So all the rest of this looks just like the first kind of equation, and the only extra
Dialogue: 0,00:33:57.240,00:33:58.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,piece is the sigma ni.
Dialogue: 0,00:34:00.300,00:34:05.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,When I write down the matrix that represents the linear system I'm going to solve to compute
Dialogue: 0,00:34:05.300,00:34:08.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,those coefficients, what's going to change?
Dialogue: 0,00:34:08.080,00:34:11.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,What will be different?
Dialogue: 0,00:34:13.260,00:34:18.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is exactly the same matrix we set up for the first kind of equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:34:18.840,00:34:24.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Each column corresponds to the contribution of a density to all the collocation points.
Dialogue: 0,00:34:24.880,00:34:31.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,Each row corresponds to the contributions of all the densities to a given collocation
Dialogue: 0,00:34:31.460,00:34:31.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,point.
Dialogue: 0,00:34:31.820,00:34:36.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the extra piece that the second kind of equation added to it is what?
Dialogue: 0,00:34:38.080,00:34:40.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Just these ones.
Dialogue: 0,00:34:40.080,00:34:47.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that's because the second kind of equation had the density showing up both outside the
Dialogue: 0,00:34:47.580,00:34:51.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,integral equation and inside the integral equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:34:51.040,00:34:54.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what happens in this case when we find the discretization?
Dialogue: 0,00:34:54.260,00:35:00.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well, and it's really hard to see in this picture, as you increase the order the answers
Dialogue: 0,00:35:00.140,00:35:02.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,get better and better.
Dialogue: 0,00:35:02.260,00:35:04.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,It converges.
Dialogue: 0,00:35:04.260,00:35:07.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,The first kind of equation didn't converge.

Dialogue: 0,00:35:07.760,00:35:07.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,It converges.
Dialogue: 0,00:35:07.880,00:35:08.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,It converges.
Dialogue: 0,00:35:08.380,00:35:08.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,It converges.
Dialogue: 0,00:35:08.880,00:35:09.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,It converges.
Dialogue: 0,00:35:09.380,00:35:13.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we're going to think a little bit about how this happened now, and then we're going
Dialogue: 0,00:35:13.820,00:35:16.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,to try to take advantage of that.
Dialogue: 0,00:35:16.400,00:35:23.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the question is, of course, the ones you probably think of or the ones you know are
Dialogue: 0,00:35:23.100,00:35:26.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,I know the potential, and I want to calculate the density.
Dialogue: 0,00:35:26.440,00:35:29.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,These are the ones that often come up when you write them down physically in 3D.
Dialogue: 0,00:35:29.880,00:35:34.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,But there are other kinds of formulations of those problems that generate second kind
Dialogue: 0,00:35:34.800,00:35:37.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,equations, and we're going to do that in a moment.
Dialogue: 0,00:35:37.560,00:35:48.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we need to think about what this integral operator does, and we're going to try to develop
Dialogue: 0,00:35:48.180,00:35:49.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,some intuition.
Dialogue: 0,00:35:49.180,00:35:52.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm not going to be very formal, but I'm going to try to give you some intuition about what's
Dialogue: 0,00:35:52.340,00:35:54.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,going on.
Dialogue: 0,00:35:54.280,00:35:58.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what does the integral operator do?
Dialogue: 0,00:35:58.040,00:36:03.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,When you put something into an integral, you really only get to see what's under the curve.
Dialogue: 0,00:36:03.040,00:36:09.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the area under the curve is kind of an averaging of a function.
Dialogue: 0,00:36:09.920,00:36:16.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we might imagine that this integral operator actually takes lots of functions and produces
Dialogue: 0,00:36:16.660,00:36:19.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,the same output.
Dialogue: 0,00:36:19.240,00:36:23.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,If that were a linear system, we'd think of it as being singular, and it is true and singular
Dialogue: 0,00:36:23.340,00:36:25.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,in the case of this integral operator.
Dialogue: 0,00:36:25.860,00:36:32.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,That is, if I imagine a function that is non-zero only at one point, and I put it inside an
Dialogue: 0,00:36:32.200,00:36:32.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,integral.
Dialogue: 0,00:36:32.980,00:36:38.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,So instead the term is multiplied by, it doesn't blow up, it doesn't go to infinity, then the
Dialogue: 0,00:36:38.280,00:36:39.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,output is zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:36:39.280,00:36:44.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,The area under the curve for a function like this is zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:36:44.320,00:36:49.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So imagine I have a line, and then I put all these needles on it.
Dialogue: 0,00:36:49.040,00:37:01.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So imagine, I don't know, imagine a porcupine compared to an armadillo.
Dialogue: 0,00:37:01.040,00:37:02.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,One has a smooth surface.
Dialogue: 0,00:37:02.960,00:37:06.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,So these methods can't tell the difference between the two, because the porcupine has
Dialogue: 0,00:37:06.880,00:37:09.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,quills, and these quills have no area under them.
Dialogue: 0,00:37:09.300,00:37:14.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So from an integral operator, you can't tell the difference between a porcupine and an armadillo.
Dialogue: 0,00:37:14.200,00:37:17.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,You can, if you pick it up, you get stuck.
Dialogue: 0,00:37:17.140,00:37:24.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that's sort of the problem, is that when you look at this, you have all these functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:37:24.240,00:37:30.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if I come up with a density that satisfies my integral equation, that is, produces an
Dialogue: 0,00:37:30.520,00:37:31.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,output.
Dialogue: 0,00:37:32.960,00:37:37.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I also have, so if I've got a density that satisfies my integral equation, and I
Dialogue: 0,00:37:37.460,00:37:43.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,also have all these densities, all these quills, if you like, that I can add to my function,
Dialogue: 0,00:37:43.840,00:37:47.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I can still satisfy the integral equation, because once I plug them into the integral,
Dialogue: 0,00:37:47.580,00:37:49.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,they come out as zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:37:49.140,00:37:54.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,It means if I've got one solution, I have an infinite number of solutions.
Dialogue: 0,00:37:54.700,00:38:01.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's why in 1D, when we refine the discretization, we're getting the same thing.
Dialogue: 0,00:38:01.960,00:38:02.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:38:02.960,00:38:07.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we're getting this problem that when we do this collocation operation, and we start
Dialogue: 0,00:38:07.800,00:38:14.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,to refine the discretization, we discover that we're picking up the case of the quills.
Dialogue: 0,00:38:14.480,00:38:21.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we're, imagine taking an integral and making it into shorter and shorter integrals.
Dialogue: 0,00:38:21.720,00:38:30.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we're taking this interval, and we're basically taking these boxcars, and when we refine the
Dialogue: 0,00:38:30.840,00:38:31.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,discretization, we take those quills.
Dialogue: 0,00:38:31.960,00:38:40.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,We take those boxcars and we make them into smaller boxcars.
Dialogue: 0,00:38:40.460,00:38:42.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And even smaller boxcars.
Dialogue: 0,00:38:42.960,00:38:55.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,And as we go down in the discretization, we're getting closer and closer to these functions
Dialogue: 0,00:38:55.700,00:38:59.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,which are one point, but they're non-zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:38:59.140,00:39:00.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,The two quills.
Dialogue: 0,00:39:00.960,00:39:01.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:39:01.960,00:39:02.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have a bunch of them.
Dialogue: 0,00:39:02.960,00:39:03.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we have lots of them.
Dialogue: 0,00:39:03.960,00:39:04.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:39:04.960,00:39:05.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,They can be anywhere.
Dialogue: 0,00:39:05.960,00:39:06.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,We can have one here in the middle.
Dialogue: 0,00:39:06.960,00:39:07.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,We can put a quill, we can put lots and lots of them.
Dialogue: 0,00:39:07.960,00:39:08.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,In fact there are an infinite number of them.
Dialogue: 0,00:39:08.960,00:39:21.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we're going to need to be, in a few minutes, a little bit more formal about it, and what
Dialogue: 0,00:39:21.960,00:39:26.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,we're going to think about is k, the operator, the integral operator, takes functions to
Dialogue: 0,00:39:26.960,00:39:27.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:39:27.960,00:39:31.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,k with an underbar under it takes vectors to vectors.
Dialogue: 0,00:39:31.960,00:39:36.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we're going to have to be a little careful about that because when we do the discretization,
Dialogue: 0,00:39:36.960,00:39:41.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,we're going to worry about whether we're talking about the operator, the operator applied to
Dialogue: 0,00:39:41.460,00:39:45.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,piecewise constant representations, or actually the matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:39:45.960,00:39:50.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's have a look at what happens.
Dialogue: 0,00:39:50.460,00:39:57.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we're going to look at the matrix and see what happens as we start to refine the discretization.
Dialogue: 0,00:39:57.420,00:40:00.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's a little bit hard to see here, but what's happening is when n equals 10, you're
Dialogue: 0,00:40:00.960,00:40:03.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,going to have 10 eigenvalues of that matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:40:03.960,00:40:07.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's the collocation matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:40:07.960,00:40:10.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So imagine, calculate the eigenvalues when n equals 10.
Dialogue: 0,00:40:10.960,00:40:14.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Calculate the eigenvalues when n equals 20, you'll get 20 of them.
Dialogue: 0,00:40:14.960,00:40:18.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Calculate the eigenvalues when n equals 40, then you'll have 40 eigenvalues.
Dialogue: 0,00:40:18.960,00:40:21.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then plot them all together.
Dialogue: 0,00:40:21.460,00:40:28.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And you'll see that when n equals 10, the first 10 eigenvalues go from somewhere around
Dialogue: 0,00:40:28.960,00:40:29.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,2 or 3 down to, I don't know, 10.
Dialogue: 0,00:40:29.960,00:40:30.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you'll see that when n equals 10, you'll have 10 eigenvalues.
Dialogue: 0,00:40:30.960,00:40:31.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,10 to the minus 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:40:31.960,00:40:34.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then when n equals 20, it goes down a little further.
Dialogue: 0,00:40:34.960,00:40:37.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then when n equals 40, they go down a little further.
Dialogue: 0,00:40:37.960,00:40:42.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And as we refine the discretization more and more, what's happening in the eigenvalues
Dialogue: 0,00:40:42.960,00:40:45.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,is they're going closer and closer to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:40:45.960,00:40:50.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the more you refine the discretization, not only are the eigenvalues going to 0, there
Dialogue: 0,00:40:50.960,00:40:52.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,are more and more of them.
Dialogue: 0,00:40:52.960,00:40:58.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you infinitely refine the discretization, you end up with an infinite number of 0 eigenvalues,
Dialogue: 0,00:40:58.960,00:40:59.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,which means the matrix is infinite.
Dialogue: 0,00:40:59.960,00:41:03.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the matrix is incredibly singular.
Dialogue: 0,00:41:03.960,00:41:09.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's what goes wrong when we try to converge this problem.
Dialogue: 0,00:41:09.960,00:41:15.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what do you think happens to the eigenvalue picture when we go to the second kind of question?
Dialogue: 0,00:41:15.960,00:41:19.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,What happens to the eigenvalues of a matrix when you add the identity to it?
Dialogue: 0,00:41:29.960,00:41:37.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So how many of you know the spectral mapping theorem?
Dialogue: 0,00:41:37.960,00:41:40.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Have you heard the spectral mapping theorem?
Dialogue: 0,00:41:40.960,00:41:43.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,The most useful theorem you'll ever learn.
Dialogue: 0,00:41:43.960,00:41:48.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,It says if I take a function of a matrix, if I want to know the eigenvalues of a function
Dialogue: 0,00:41:48.960,00:41:53.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,of a matrix, it's the function of the eigenvalues of the original matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:41:53.960,00:41:58.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that works for any analytic function, any function you can represent with a Taylor series.
Dialogue: 0,00:41:58.960,00:42:11.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if we have i plus a, then the eigenvalues of i plus a equal the eigenvalues of a with
Dialogue: 0,00:42:11.960,00:42:13.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,the 1 interval.
Dialogue: 0,00:42:13.960,00:42:15.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is a function of a matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:42:15.960,00:42:17.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,We're adding the identity to it.
Dialogue: 0,00:42:17.960,00:42:22.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And it says that the eigenvalues of this matrix are the same function adding 1 to it to the
Dialogue: 0,00:42:22.960,00:42:24.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,eigenvalues.
Dialogue: 0,00:42:24.960,00:42:27.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,What happens if I add 1 to those eigenvalues?
Dialogue: 0,00:42:27.960,00:42:30.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Do they go to the 0 anymore?
Dialogue: 0,00:42:30.960,00:42:33.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now we have this problem.
Dialogue: 0,00:42:33.960,00:42:39.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Our first kind of integral equation generates a matrix that is progressively worse conditioned.
Dialogue: 0,00:42:39.960,00:42:42.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we see it because the eigenvalues are approaching 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:42:42.960,00:42:47.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the other way to see it is to think of this discretization, this progressively refined
Dialogue: 0,00:42:47.960,00:42:53.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,discretization, where as we increase the number of sections we're breaking the interval into,
Dialogue: 0,00:42:53.960,00:42:57.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,they get thinner and thinner and they start to look like needles, like quills.
Dialogue: 0,00:42:57.960,00:43:01.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,These things that when you put them into an integral you get 0 out of them.
Dialogue: 0,00:43:01.960,00:43:04.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's the intuition.
Dialogue: 0,00:43:04.960,00:43:11.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then the great thing about the second kind of equation is it's the same operator plus the identity.
Dialogue: 0,00:43:11.960,00:43:16.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Which means all those eigenvalues that are accumulating around 0, what are they going to accumulate around?
Dialogue: 0,00:43:16.960,00:43:19.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,1.
Dialogue: 0,00:43:19.960,00:43:26.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what does that mean about the second kind of equation as you refine the discretization?
Dialogue: 0,00:43:27.960,00:43:34.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Does it get worse conditioned as you refine the discretization for the second kind of equation?
Dialogue: 0,00:43:34.960,00:43:36.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what are all the eigenvalues?
Dialogue: 0,00:43:36.960,00:43:38.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I keep refining and refining.
Dialogue: 0,00:43:38.960,00:43:40.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Finding elements, finding value methods.
Dialogue: 0,00:43:40.960,00:43:42.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,What happens as you refine the discretization?
Dialogue: 0,00:43:42.960,00:43:44.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,What happens to the matrix?
Dialogue: 0,00:43:44.960,00:43:46.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,It gets worse conditioned.
Dialogue: 0,00:43:46.960,00:43:48.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And worse and worse and worse.
Dialogue: 0,00:43:48.960,00:43:52.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Second kind of internal equations, what happens when you refine the discretization?
Dialogue: 0,00:43:52.960,00:43:57.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,The operator has eigenvalues that approach 0 and then it's shifted by 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:43:57.960,00:44:04.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it doesn't matter how fine you make the discretization, the second kind of integral equations in fact don't convert.
Dialogue: 0,00:44:04.960,00:44:11.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the way to think about it is when you have the identity plus k applied to a smooth function plus a quill,
Dialogue: 0,00:44:11.960,00:44:16.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,what comes out, the quill still shows up because it shows up through the identity operator.
Dialogue: 0,00:44:16.960,00:44:24.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that means second kind operator identity plus k can tell the difference between an armadillo and a porcupine.
Dialogue: 0,00:44:24.960,00:44:26.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And you, you have to pick them up.
Dialogue: 0,00:44:26.960,00:44:38.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that simple intuition is behind why when we look at the eigenvalues of the second kind integral equation
Dialogue: 0,00:44:38.960,00:44:43.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we increase the discretization, the first ten, well, the first few are wherever they are.
Dialogue: 0,00:44:43.960,00:44:49.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then, and then the next ten, well, they're by that point really close to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:44:49.960,00:44:53.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then after that, they all just, all the operator eigenvalues are close to 0,
Dialogue: 0,00:44:53.960,00:44:55.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,which means the second kind operator, they're all really close to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:44:55.960,00:44:56.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's the first kind of integral equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:44:56.960,00:44:59.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,The second kind of integral equation is always close to 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:44:59.960,00:45:06.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if I apply something like a Krylov subspace method to this problem, how badly conditioned is it?
Dialogue: 0,00:45:06.960,00:45:10.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,How fast is that going to convert?
Dialogue: 0,00:45:10.960,00:45:13.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is this an ill-conditioned matrix ever?
Dialogue: 0,00:45:13.960,00:45:16.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,No matter how fine you make the discretization?
Dialogue: 0,00:45:16.960,00:45:19.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,No, it's the second kind integral equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:45:19.960,00:45:23.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's always well conditioned.
Dialogue: 0,00:45:23.960,00:45:25.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Almost.
Dialogue: 0,00:45:25.960,00:45:32.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, we're going to look at some issues about the first eigenvalues, and we'll talk about that in a moment.
Dialogue: 0,00:45:32.960,00:45:37.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, we're going to look a little bit at this theory,
Dialogue: 0,00:45:37.960,00:45:41.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I'm not going to go through the theory in that much detail here in class.
Dialogue: 0,00:45:41.960,00:45:47.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm going to flip through a bunch of the slides and leave the notes for you on the website.
Dialogue: 0,00:45:47.960,00:45:52.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,There are a lot of details about tracking the differences between what's the integral operator,
Dialogue: 0,00:45:52.960,00:45:54.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,what's the integral operator applied to these basis functions,
Dialogue: 0,00:45:54.960,00:45:57.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,and what's actually the matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:45:57.960,00:46:00.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we're going to need to track that carefully,
Dialogue: 0,00:46:00.960,00:46:05.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I'm going to sort of wave my hands over some of those details and let you read them,
Dialogue: 0,00:46:05.960,00:46:08.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,because it's just not that interesting to watch in class.
Dialogue: 0,00:46:08.960,00:46:11.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,But you can look at the details, you can go through them,
Dialogue: 0,00:46:11.960,00:46:15.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,but it's not a good class to exercise.
Dialogue: 0,00:46:15.960,00:46:19.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, we're going to come up with three things.
Dialogue: 0,00:46:19.960,00:46:21.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,We have the matrix, which has a bar underneath it.
Dialogue: 0,00:46:21.960,00:46:23.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,We have the operator, which has nothing next to it.
Dialogue: 0,00:46:23.960,00:46:24.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:46:24.960,00:46:29.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the operator applied to a piecewise constant discretization with n basis functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:46:29.960,00:46:32.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we've got these three different operators.
Dialogue: 0,00:46:32.960,00:46:39.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we're going to try to do that so that we can compare the discretization of piecewise constant density
Dialogue: 0,00:46:39.960,00:46:43.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,to the original operator and write down the difference between them.
Dialogue: 0,00:46:43.960,00:46:47.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that's really what we're going to try to show.
Dialogue: 0,00:46:47.960,00:46:53.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,We can write down, if we represent the density as a weighted combination of basis functions,
Dialogue: 0,00:46:53.960,00:46:57.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,where the basis functions in this case were orthogonal.
Dialogue: 0,00:46:57.960,00:47:01.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Are the piecewise constant basis functions orthogonal?
Dialogue: 0,00:47:01.960,00:47:05.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,If I have two functions, one that looks like this,
Dialogue: 0,00:47:05.960,00:47:10.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,and another one that looks like the second case, a shifted pulse,
Dialogue: 0,00:47:10.960,00:47:16.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,are these orthogonal to each other?
Dialogue: 0,00:47:16.960,00:47:21.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is the integral of basis one times basis two,
Dialogue: 0,00:47:23.960,00:47:28.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,equal to zero?
Dialogue: 0,00:47:28.960,00:47:32.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,If I take the product of these two and integrate, is their result zero?
Dialogue: 0,00:47:32.960,00:47:33.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:47:33.960,00:47:35.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so these are orthogonal.
Dialogue: 0,00:47:35.960,00:47:38.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,If I start to do rooftop basis functions, they won't be.
Dialogue: 0,00:47:38.960,00:47:42.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,But we're going to assume that just because it makes it a little easier to think about
Dialogue: 0,00:47:42.960,00:47:44.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,how to do things like projecting.
Dialogue: 0,00:47:44.960,00:47:48.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we can project a given density onto the basis function
Dialogue: 0,00:47:48.960,00:47:51.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,just by projecting it onto the orthogonal basis.
Dialogue: 0,00:47:51.960,00:47:52.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,You don't have to set up a system equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:47:52.960,00:47:54.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,You just project.
Dialogue: 0,00:47:54.960,00:47:57.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And once we've done that, once we've done this projection,
Dialogue: 0,00:47:57.960,00:48:02.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,we can then think about writing down the integral operator in terms of these projections.
Dialogue: 0,00:48:02.960,00:48:04.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is the point where I'm going to wave my hands,
Dialogue: 0,00:48:04.960,00:48:07.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,because at this point you can go through the details of this,
Dialogue: 0,00:48:07.960,00:48:12.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,but what we're trying to do is to see some way of comparing the exact integral operator
Dialogue: 0,00:48:12.960,00:48:17.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,to what we get when we introduce this piecewise constant density discretization.
Dialogue: 0,00:48:17.960,00:48:19.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we're going to see that we get this projection,
Dialogue: 0,00:48:19.960,00:48:21.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we're going to have to keep track of that.
Dialogue: 0,00:48:22.960,00:48:29.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,But what we get out of this is that we have a representation of,
Dialogue: 0,00:48:29.960,00:48:33.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,if we start with a density that's piecewise constant,
Dialogue: 0,00:48:33.960,00:48:36.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's a density that's defined everywhere.
Dialogue: 0,00:48:36.960,00:48:38.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,We have an operator that's defined everywhere.
Dialogue: 0,00:48:38.960,00:48:39.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is not the matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:48:39.960,00:48:44.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now it takes a piecewise constant density, which is defined over space,
Dialogue: 0,00:48:44.960,00:48:47.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,and maps it into a potential that's defined over space,
Dialogue: 0,00:48:47.960,00:48:51.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,and set it equal to a set of another potential that's piecewise constant.
Dialogue: 0,00:48:52.960,00:48:55.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,These are all functions of space.
Dialogue: 0,00:48:55.960,00:48:59.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,We can then compare the two, and we can ask the question.
Dialogue: 0,00:48:59.960,00:49:05.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if we start with a second kind integral operator,
Dialogue: 0,00:49:05.960,00:49:08.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then we introduce a discretization,
Dialogue: 0,00:49:08.960,00:49:14.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,so that the piecewise constant discretization,
Dialogue: 0,00:49:14.960,00:49:18.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we say that the original integral operator is solvable,
Dialogue: 0,00:49:18.960,00:49:21.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,so we say that I plus K inverse is,
Dialogue: 0,00:49:21.960,00:49:23.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,is bounded.
Dialogue: 0,00:49:23.960,00:49:26.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,That means there really is a solution to the second kind integral operator.
Dialogue: 0,00:49:26.960,00:49:30.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,If there is one,
Dialogue: 0,00:49:30.960,00:49:34.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we also describe the discrete equivalent,
Dialogue: 0,00:49:34.960,00:49:37.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,that is, we introduce a piecewise constant density,
Dialogue: 0,00:49:37.960,00:49:39.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,and come up with a discrete operator,
Dialogue: 0,00:49:39.960,00:49:41.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,we get these two things.
Dialogue: 0,00:49:41.960,00:49:44.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,If we have consistency,
Dialogue: 0,00:49:44.960,00:49:47.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,meaning if the continuous operator
Dialogue: 0,00:49:47.960,00:49:50.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the operator projected onto the discrete basis set,
Dialogue: 0,00:49:50.960,00:49:53.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,if they apply to any test density,
Dialogue: 0,00:49:53.960,00:49:54.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,goes to zero,
Dialogue: 0,00:49:54.960,00:49:56.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,that just says the two operators,
Dialogue: 0,00:49:56.960,00:49:58.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,the discrete and the continuous one,
Dialogue: 0,00:49:58.960,00:50:01.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,do the same thing as the n goes to infinity,
Dialogue: 0,00:50:01.960,00:50:03.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,if it goes to zero,
Dialogue: 0,00:50:03.960,00:50:06.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we do the same thing with the right-hand side,
Dialogue: 0,00:50:06.960,00:50:11.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,then the discretization converges.
Dialogue: 0,00:50:11.960,00:50:16.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's all we need.
Dialogue: 0,00:50:16.960,00:50:17.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now to prove that,
Dialogue: 0,00:50:17.960,00:50:18.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's a collection of steps,
Dialogue: 0,00:50:18.960,00:50:20.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I'm not going to try to drag you through this,
Dialogue: 0,00:50:20.960,00:50:22.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,but I'm going to try to get you through it.
Dialogue: 0,00:50:22.960,00:50:25.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And it has a collection of technical points,
Dialogue: 0,00:50:25.960,00:50:27.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,many of which are,
Dialogue: 0,00:50:27.960,00:50:30.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,sort of get us lost in the details.
Dialogue: 0,00:50:30.960,00:50:35.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,What I want to say is this.
Dialogue: 0,00:50:35.960,00:50:42.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,As long as your representation of the integral operator converges,
Dialogue: 0,00:50:42.960,00:50:44.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,that is, it will give you the same result
Dialogue: 0,00:50:44.960,00:50:46.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,as the original integral operator
Dialogue: 0,00:50:46.960,00:50:49.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,when you refine,
Dialogue: 0,00:50:49.960,00:50:50.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,that is,
Dialogue: 0,00:50:50.960,00:50:53.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,as long as you have a way of evaluating the integral that's accurate,
Dialogue: 0,00:50:53.960,00:50:55.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,and gets progressively more accurate,
Dialogue: 0,00:50:55.960,00:50:57.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,then the density will converge.
Dialogue: 0,00:50:57.960,00:51:01.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the accuracy with which you represent the integral operator,
Dialogue: 0,00:51:01.960,00:51:03.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,the rate within that it converges,
Dialogue: 0,00:51:03.960,00:51:06.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,will be the same as the way the density converges.
Dialogue: 0,00:51:06.960,00:51:09.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, what does this mean?
Dialogue: 0,00:51:09.960,00:51:13.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, I didn't take you through the details.
Dialogue: 0,00:51:13.960,00:51:18.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,It says that if I have a second-count integral equation,
Dialogue: 0,00:51:18.960,00:51:20.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I accurately compute the number of points,
Dialogue: 0,00:51:20.960,00:51:22.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I accurately compute the integrals
Dialogue: 0,00:51:22.960,00:51:24.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,in the second-count integral equation,
Dialogue: 0,00:51:24.960,00:51:26.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,that's all I have to do.
Dialogue: 0,00:51:26.960,00:51:29.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,As long as I've computed those integrals accurately,
Dialogue: 0,00:51:29.960,00:51:30.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,I will get convergence,
Dialogue: 0,00:51:30.960,00:51:32.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the rate at which the thing will converge
Dialogue: 0,00:51:32.960,00:51:36.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,is dependent entirely on the rate at which
Dialogue: 0,00:51:36.960,00:51:40.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,the evaluation of the integral converges.
Dialogue: 0,00:51:40.960,00:51:42.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,With that in mind,
Dialogue: 0,00:51:42.960,00:51:45.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,what method should you use to evaluate the integral?
Dialogue: 0,00:51:45.960,00:51:49.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,The Gauss plot of the curve.
Dialogue: 0,00:51:49.960,00:51:51.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, the Gauss plot of the curve.
Dialogue: 0,00:51:51.960,00:51:54.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because that gives us exponential convergence.
Dialogue: 0,00:51:54.960,00:51:57.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,That means if we're solving a second-count integral equation,
Dialogue: 0,00:51:57.960,00:52:02.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,we should get exponential convergence for the integral equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:52:02.960,00:52:06.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, this is the thing about second-count equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:52:06.960,00:52:09.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is what is so amazing about them,
Dialogue: 0,00:52:09.960,00:52:12.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,and why for years they were very popular,
Dialogue: 0,00:52:12.960,00:52:17.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,until the problem with the dense matrices they generated
Dialogue: 0,00:52:17.960,00:52:18.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,became an issue,
Dialogue: 0,00:52:18.960,00:52:21.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then we switched to methods that produced sparse matrices.
Dialogue: 0,00:52:21.960,00:52:23.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And now we have other methods with sparse Y and Bs,
Dialogue: 0,00:52:23.960,00:52:25.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,so we use them again too.
Dialogue: 0,00:52:25.960,00:52:28.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,But let's try this out.
Dialogue: 0,00:52:28.960,00:52:30.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right, so this is what we're going to do.
Dialogue: 0,00:52:30.960,00:52:33.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,We're going to say we have an integral equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:52:33.960,00:52:35.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,We have a second-count integral equation,
Dialogue: 0,00:52:35.960,00:52:39.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we're going to apply a quadrature to the collocation equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:52:39.960,00:52:40.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So here are my collocation equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:52:40.960,00:52:42.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Here's my test point, XI,
Dialogue: 0,00:52:42.960,00:52:44.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,here's my Green's function, my unknown density,
Dialogue: 0,00:52:44.960,00:52:46.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we're going to replace this integral
Dialogue: 0,00:52:46.960,00:52:48.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,with a graph.
Dialogue: 0,00:52:48.960,00:52:50.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have a quadrature approximation.
Dialogue: 0,00:52:50.960,00:52:51.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,We have the evaluation points,
Dialogue: 0,00:52:51.960,00:52:53.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,X prime gets replaced by XK,
Dialogue: 0,00:52:53.960,00:52:55.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,the weights for that quadrature point,
Dialogue: 0,00:52:55.960,00:52:59.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,and remember, XI is the collocation point.
Dialogue: 0,00:52:59.960,00:53:01.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So all we did was to say,
Dialogue: 0,00:53:01.960,00:53:03.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,let's do the integral equation,

Dialogue: 0,01:00:31.960,01:00:33.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,You lose the spectral convergence.
Dialogue: 0,01:00:33.960,01:00:37.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right, so I used a little sleight of hand
Dialogue: 0,01:00:37.960,01:00:40.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,to get the integral to be the same.
Dialogue: 0,01:00:40.960,01:00:43.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,I picked the example very carefully.
Dialogue: 0,01:00:43.960,01:00:45.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the question is now,
Dialogue: 0,01:00:45.960,01:00:47.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,is that a practical method?
Dialogue: 0,01:00:47.960,01:00:50.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we now have this Nystrom method,

Dialogue: 0,01:00:52.960,01:00:54.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the answer is,

Dialogue: 0,01:01:09.960,01:01:10.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because it's really good because
Dialogue: 0,01:01:11.960,01:01:12.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's because most physical problems
Dialogue: 0,01:01:12.960,01:01:14.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,and interests have singular integrals,

Dialogue: 0,01:01:33.960,01:01:36.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,which means these Nystrom methods don't work.
Dialogue: 0,01:01:36.960,01:01:38.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well,
Dialogue: 0,01:01:38.960,01:01:46.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we're going to stop here and then I'm going to talk a little bit about one
Dialogue: 0,01:01:46.200,01:01:51.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,particular case. I'm going to show you a little bit of the details of this in
Dialogue: 0,01:01:51.000,01:01:58.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,order to give you a sense of the fact that there are interesting interval operators that do,
Dialogue: 0,01:01:58.900,01:02:02.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,for which this is the case.
Dialogue: 0,01:02:03.840,01:02:07.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we'll do this as part of the project.
Dialogue: 0,01:02:08.960,01:02:17.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,So when we think about trying to solve an integral equation, imagine in 2D, bless you,
Dialogue: 0,01:02:17.900,01:02:23.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,we're trying to solve a Dirichlet problem. So we imagine that we know the potential at
Dialogue: 0,01:02:23.900,01:02:29.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,each point x and it's given to us by an integral of now the 2D Green function,
Dialogue: 0,01:02:29.900,01:02:36.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,which I'm going to write as x prime and sigma of x prime d gamma.
Dialogue: 0,01:02:36.900,01:02:38.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we're going to think of this as,
Dialogue: 0,01:02:38.900,01:02:38.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,well, we're going to think of this as a,
Dialogue: 0,01:02:38.940,01:02:44.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,we have the pluses equation outside and we want to know the density and we know,
Dialogue: 0,01:02:44.940,01:02:51.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,we know the potential on the surface.
Dialogue: 0,01:02:51.940,01:02:59.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we're trying to solve this problem. This is the Dirichlet problem.
Dialogue: 0,01:03:08.940,01:03:13.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what kind is this? Is this first kind or second kind?
Dialogue: 0,01:03:13.940,01:03:16.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is first kind.
Dialogue: 0,01:03:27.940,01:03:33.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we're not going to be able to use our Easter method for the first kind equation because one,
Dialogue: 0,01:03:33.940,01:03:38.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's only the second kind for which we have that area about the quadr- the,
Dialogue: 0,01:03:38.940,01:03:44.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,the integral equation solution picking up the same asymptotic behavior as the,
Dialogue: 0,01:03:44.940,01:03:50.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,or the same accuracy as the quadrature. So we can't use it for a first kind equation.
Dialogue: 0,01:03:50.940,01:03:53.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we're not going to be able to solve this Dirichlet problem.
Dialogue: 0,01:03:53.940,01:04:03.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,What about a Neumann problem? Suppose I have the same interval, the same equation,
Dialogue: 0,01:04:03.940,01:04:07.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,and instead I have partial psi, partial n.
Dialogue: 0,01:04:07.940,01:04:11.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then, it's given, and x is given.
Dialogue: 0,01:04:20.940,01:04:23.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,What's the integral equation I write down then?
Dialogue: 0,01:04:23.940,01:04:28.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well, it's still true that potential is given by the screen function,
Dialogue: 0,01:04:28.940,01:04:31.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,multiplied by density.
Dialogue: 0,01:04:34.940,01:04:36.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Except I don't know what this is.
Dialogue: 0,01:04:36.940,01:04:41.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,So how can I turn that equation into one that I can use for the Neumann problem?
Dialogue: 0,01:04:41.940,01:04:44.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,What could I do?
Dialogue: 0,01:04:44.940,01:04:46.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,So here's my Neumann problem.
Dialogue: 0,01:04:53.940,01:04:55.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Just differentiate the whole thing.
Dialogue: 0,01:04:55.940,01:04:58.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,You could differentiate the whole thing. Alright, so let's differentiate the whole thing.
Dialogue: 0,01:04:58.940,01:05:02.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we're going to calculate d by the n of psi of x.
Dialogue: 0,01:05:02.940,01:05:05.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we're going to note that this is the n of x.
Dialogue: 0,01:05:05.940,01:05:07.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we're going to keep track of that.
Dialogue: 0,01:05:07.940,01:05:09.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we're going to leave that in the moment.
Dialogue: 0,01:05:22.940,01:05:24.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,So is that helping us at all?
Dialogue: 0,01:05:24.940,01:05:26.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,What is this thing?
Dialogue: 0,01:05:26.940,01:05:30.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Can I pull the dn dx inside the integral?
Dialogue: 0,01:05:30.940,01:05:36.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes.
Dialogue: 0,01:05:36.940,01:05:38.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Can you?
Dialogue: 0,01:05:38.940,01:05:40.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,The integration is over a different variable.
Dialogue: 0,01:05:40.940,01:05:41.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Say again?
Dialogue: 0,01:05:41.940,01:05:43.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,The integration is over a different variable.
Dialogue: 0,01:05:43.940,01:05:45.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,The integration is over a different variable.
Dialogue: 0,01:05:45.940,01:05:47.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,So can I pull that inside?
Dialogue: 0,01:05:47.940,01:05:49.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,If I do, what does it mean?
Dialogue: 0,01:05:49.940,01:05:52.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I can pull that normal derivative inside.
Dialogue: 0,01:05:52.940,01:05:55.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,But then, what happens to it?
Dialogue: 0,01:05:55.940,01:05:58.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,You have 3n of...
Dialogue: 0,01:05:58.940,01:05:59.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now, let's...
Dialogue: 0,01:05:59.940,01:06:02.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's imagine what that potential looks like.
Dialogue: 0,01:06:02.940,01:06:05.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,And see if we can think out what it might look like.
Dialogue: 0,01:06:19.940,01:06:23.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I might expect that if I write down the potential,

Dialogue: 0,01:06:25.940,01:06:28.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm approaching... I want to know what the potential looks like.
Dialogue: 0,01:06:29.940,01:06:31.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,As I approach this density.
Dialogue: 0,01:06:33.940,01:06:37.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,What do I expect the potential to look like as I approach this density?
Dialogue: 0,01:06:40.940,01:06:42.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,In 3D, it's easy to think about.
Dialogue: 0,01:06:42.940,01:06:45.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's think about it in 3D.
Dialogue: 0,01:06:47.940,01:06:49.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we can get some intuition from 3D.
Dialogue: 0,01:06:49.940,01:06:53.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then I'll stop there and we'll do it a little bit more precisely at the beginning of next class.
Dialogue: 0,01:06:55.940,01:06:57.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,What do you think it would look like in 3D?
Dialogue: 0,01:06:57.940,01:06:58.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,So remember that...
Dialogue: 0,01:06:58.940,01:07:00.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,I have this density.
Dialogue: 0,01:07:00.940,01:07:05.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,And now this potential is equal to the integral of that density.

Dialogue: 0,01:07:26.940,01:07:28.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,I can get the potential here.
Dialogue: 0,01:07:28.940,01:07:30.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I can look at the potential...
Dialogue: 0,01:07:30.940,01:07:31.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, let's see...
Dialogue: 0,01:07:31.940,01:07:32.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's use a different variable here.

Dialogue: 0,01:07:35.940,01:07:40.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,And where R is equal to zero, that's where this line is.
Dialogue: 0,01:07:40.940,01:07:44.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Although, if we're thinking about it now in 3D, that's not a line.

Dialogue: 0,01:07:47.940,01:07:49.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,So here's my charge panel.

Dialogue: 0,01:07:55.940,01:08:00.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we go, we're approaching this charge, and then we're coming out the other side.

Dialogue: 0,01:08:09.120,01:08:14.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then on, if I hold it this way, so on the right side, what's the potential going to be?

Dialogue: 0,01:08:38.120,01:08:42.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right, so this is, again, in 3D, this is what the potential is going to look like.
