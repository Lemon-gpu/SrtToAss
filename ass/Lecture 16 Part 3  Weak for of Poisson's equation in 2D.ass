Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:07.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,So find everything in 2D. So here, to limit time, we're just going to focus on one single equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:07.720,00:00:18.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,We are focusing on the Laplace equation, the divergence of the gradient of a scalar function u plus f is equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:18.480,00:00:33.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, and in particular, let's focus first on the very simple case where u is equal to 0 at the boundary of a domain.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:33.580,00:00:39.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have a domain omega, and the boundary of the domain is called partial omega.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:39.120,00:00:43.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so u is equal to 0 everywhere on the domain.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:44.720,00:00:47.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,And here, let's also...
Dialogue: 0,00:00:47.620,00:00:48.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,For the...
Dialogue: 0,00:00:48.480,00:00:59.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,For the purpose of simplicity in integrating the right-hand side, let's say f is also equal to 1 over the whole space.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:00.340,00:01:04.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,But even though the solution is going to be non-trivial, because of...
Dialogue: 0,00:01:04.300,00:01:09.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,For different geometry, the solution to this differential equation is going to have different shapes.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:10.900,00:01:11.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right? Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:12.540,00:01:16.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what is the weak form? How do we derive the weak form of this equation?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:17.780,00:01:18.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,We use...
Dialogue: 0,00:01:18.480,00:01:20.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,We use the same...
Dialogue: 0,00:01:20.480,00:01:28.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Same methodology of multiplying a v with the differential equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:28.540,00:01:33.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,And integrate over the whole domain.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:33.800,00:01:37.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,That has to be equal to 0 for any v.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:40.060,00:01:43.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we use integration by parts.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:43.160,00:01:48.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,So v times the Laplacian, which is the divergence of gradient.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:48.480,00:01:49.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have the gradient of u.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:50.620,00:01:52.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,Can be computed, can be...
Dialogue: 0,00:01:52.500,00:01:54.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Can be integrated by parts.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:54.580,00:01:56.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,And what we get is...
Dialogue: 0,00:01:56.640,00:02:04.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,This divergence operator is going to become a gradient operator on v.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:05.440,00:02:05.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:06.000,00:02:09.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have a gradient of v, and the dot is still the same.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:10.060,00:02:12.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the gradient of u is still here.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:13.360,00:02:15.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is integrated over dx.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:15.660,00:02:18.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,If we have a boundary term...
Dialogue: 0,00:02:18.200,00:02:21.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,The boundary term is going to be the normal of the boundary.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:21.880,00:02:24.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Dot with gradient of u times v.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:24.200,00:02:29.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,But here, because we are having a u satisfying the zero boundary condition,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:29.720,00:02:34.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,therefore our test function v should also satisfy the same zero boundary condition.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:34.840,00:02:38.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because v represents a perturbation on u.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:38.840,00:02:39.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:39.840,00:02:40.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,So...
Dialogue: 0,00:02:41.440,00:02:44.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the boundary term goes away because v is equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:45.080,00:02:48.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the remaining part is simply v times f.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:48.200,00:02:49.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have the gradient of v.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:49.560,00:02:50.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the gradient of v is equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:50.760,00:02:51.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have the gradient of v.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:51.720,00:02:52.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the gradient of v is equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:52.760,00:02:53.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the gradient of v is equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:53.800,00:02:57.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,And now from this formulation, we can see that...
Dialogue: 0,00:02:57.800,00:03:02.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,The first term, again, is a bilinear form.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:02.780,00:03:03.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:04.680,00:03:10.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the bilinear form would be an integral of the gradient of u, dot product with the gradient of v.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:11.000,00:03:13.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Again, it is a symmetric bilinear form.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:15.760,00:03:18.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the integral of v dot f, again,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:18.040,00:03:20.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,is going to be a linear functional.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:22.520,00:03:26.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's write this as a of u and v.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:27.240,00:03:33.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,In this case, it's integral over the domain gradient u dot gradient of v.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:34.840,00:03:38.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,And l of v is equal to integration.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:40.200,00:03:41.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's substitute the...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:42.120,00:03:43.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, let's do...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:43.000,00:03:43.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:43.400,00:03:44.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,So v times f dx.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:44.600,00:03:48.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:50.840,00:03:54.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what space are we in here?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:56.840,00:04:05.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,In what space would you need to define u and v for the bilinear form and the linear functional to be well defined?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:07.420,00:04:09.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,What linear space do we have to be in?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:09.500,00:04:11.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,What functional space does u and v have to be in?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:12.720,00:04:13.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,Each one again.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:13.880,00:04:14.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Exactly.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:14.240,00:04:14.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,Exactly.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:14.600,00:04:22.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,So u and v also has to be in each one because their respective derivatives has to be square integrable.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:23.320,00:04:34.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,If I have the derivatives to be square integrable, then I can use Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to guarantee that the weak form is going to be finite.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:34.560,00:04:35.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:36.760,00:04:44.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,The integral of the product of the gradients is less or equal to the product of the integral of the...
Dialogue: 0,00:04:44.240,00:04:45.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean, okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:45.240,00:04:59.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is less or equal to integration of grad u dot grad u half times integration of grad v dot grad v half.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:59.240,00:04:59.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:59.740,00:05:00.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's...
Dialogue: 0,00:05:00.240,00:05:12.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if each of these are bounded by the definition of the Sobolev norm, then my a u v is bounded, also called continuous.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:12.240,00:05:12.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:12.740,00:05:13.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's...
Dialogue: 0,00:05:13.240,00:05:13.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:13.480,00:05:13.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:13.580,00:05:13.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:13.640,00:05:13.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:13.880,00:05:13.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:13.940,00:05:14.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:14.120,00:05:14.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:14.200,00:05:14.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:14.240,00:05:14.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:14.340,00:05:20.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the right-hand side is going to be bounded by just another Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:21.420,00:05:22.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is...
Dialogue: 0,00:05:23.300,00:05:32.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if f is well-defined, if f is also in L2, then I can bond this by that.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:36.860,00:05:42.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this occasionally is also well-defined even if f is not a proper L2 function.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:43.300,00:05:43.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:43.580,00:05:43.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:43.640,00:05:46.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any questions on the weak form?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:46.340,00:05:49.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is A and this is L for the two-dimensional Poisson's equation.
