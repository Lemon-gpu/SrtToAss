Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:08.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,okay now our next demo is what if we have a function f that is not linear
Dialogue: 0,00:00:08.240,00:00:15.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,okay remember if we have a function f that is not not a constant what we have
Dialogue: 0,00:00:15.660,00:00:24.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,to do is to integrate this function within every interval right so so let's
Dialogue: 0,00:00:24.900,00:00:38.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,give an example of if f is equal to let's say sine of pi x so sine of pi x
Dialogue: 0,00:00:38.280,00:00:42.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,within 0 and 1 is going to be a sinusoidal function that goes up and
Dialogue: 0,00:00:42.300,00:00:49.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,down and I constructed this such that we also are going to have an analytical
Dialogue: 0,00:00:49.020,00:00:54.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,solution right we also going to have an analytical solution that is actually
Dialogue: 0,00:00:54.780,00:00:54.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,unique to the problem so we're going to have an analytical solution that is actually
Dialogue: 0,00:00:54.880,00:01:00.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,equal to sine of x times a coefficient because the second order derivative of
Dialogue: 0,00:01:00.280,00:01:07.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,sine is actually minus pi square of sine right so we also have an analytical
Dialogue: 0,00:01:07.300,00:01:14.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,solution and the BJ in this case is going to be split into two parts X X J
Dialogue: 0,00:01:14.380,00:01:24.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,minus 1 so this is J to X J of a solution that goes from 0 to 1 which
Dialogue: 0,00:01:24.520,00:01:24.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,means that we have a solution that is going to be a sinusoidal function that is
Dialogue: 0,00:01:24.760,00:01:25.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,going to be a sinusoidal function that is going to be a sinusoidal function that is
Dialogue: 0,00:01:25.180,00:01:32.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,out my X is going to be X minus X J minus 1 over X J minus X J minus 1 so
Dialogue: 0,00:01:32.080,00:01:46.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,that's the form of the V J times sine of pi X DX plus X J to X J plus 1 and the
Dialogue: 0,00:01:46.540,00:01:54.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,form of the function is going to be X minus X J over X J plus 1 minus X J on
Dialogue: 0,00:01:54.640,00:02:01.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,also times sine of pi X DX so let's see how do we construct this function yes
Dialogue: 0,00:02:06.520,00:02:16.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,5J oh yeah 5J is this hat functions right these are Phi 1 Phi 2 so each function is one over here
Dialogue: 0,00:02:16.780,00:02:22.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,uh it is one at a particular grid point and zero at all other grid points it's piecewise constant
Dialogue: 0,00:02:22.900,00:02:24.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,all right so this is
Dialogue: 0,00:02:24.640,00:02:29.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,so this is our general equation of فn into f of jed and v .
Dialogue: 0,00:02:32.080,00:02:43.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,In this particular equation we can even disease a sign coming out of a
Dialogue: 0,00:02:43.680,00:02:47.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,illion point gV J into G and let's assume this is
Dialogue: 0,00:02:47.640,00:02:54.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,the sign we set the function as a z wheels so we can use this for adding onion dice here
Dialogue: 0,00:02:54.420,00:03:06.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for example, on the first interval, we can compute we have x1, which is 0, and x2.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:06.680,00:03:09.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's use these two grid points.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:10.480,00:03:14.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's compute the Gauss quadrature points and weights within that interval.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:15.080,00:03:17.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,The way to use this is x and w.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:17.740,00:03:21.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,These are x is the location of the Gauss quadrature points, and w are the weights.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:21.800,00:03:29.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,And first of all, we give an n, which is the number of quadrature points.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:30.460,00:03:34.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,In this case, let's try a quadrature points of 5 points.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:34.500,00:03:38.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,And a and b are the intervals, which we give it x1 and x2.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:39.740,00:03:42.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it gives me the x and the weights.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:43.500,00:03:51.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So x, as you notice, are a set of numbers that lies within x1 and x2.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:51.120,00:04:03.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the maximum is 0.093, which is close to the right-hand side of the interval, but not quite.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:04.080,00:04:08.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,The minimum is 0.046, which is close to 0, but not quite.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:09.200,00:04:14.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the weights are a little bit larger in the middle than at the two ends.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:15.460,00:04:20.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's the spacing. The spacing is more sparse in the middle and more tight at the ends.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:21.120,00:04:22.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:22.580,00:04:33.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this can be used to compute the integral over the first interval.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:34.500,00:04:40.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's do this. Let's do x left, w left.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:40.820,00:04:46.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,We are going to have a right pretty soon, because in order to compute the first entry of b,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:46.480,00:04:48.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,we need to integrate over two intervals.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:49.140,00:04:50.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have the left.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:51.120,00:04:55.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have the left of both entries, and how do we approximate the integral?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:55.960,00:05:02.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is the function we need to integrate this particular function at the grid points
Dialogue: 0,00:05:04.860,00:05:12.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,times the weight corresponding to the grid point, and just sum over these five points.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:13.440,00:05:18.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's compute the number. Let's call it b of left.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:18.200,00:05:18.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:19.120,00:05:21.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's equal to
Dialogue: 0,00:05:21.120,00:05:24.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,the grid point x left minus x of 1
Dialogue: 0,00:05:24.420,00:05:31.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,divided by x i plus 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:32.780,00:05:35.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,so in this case x2 minus x1.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:36.340,00:05:39.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is the form of the basis function.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:40.480,00:05:44.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,And times sine of pi times xl.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:45.260,00:05:47.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,xl are the Gauss quadrature grid points.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:47.440,00:05:54.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I multiply this value with the Gauss quadrature weights.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:55.560,00:06:02.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So these are going to give me five numbers.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:03.280,00:06:06.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,If I sum over the five numbers,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:06.620,00:06:12.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,this is going to give me the value of the function.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:17.440,00:06:19.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,But the weights shouldn't be negative,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:19.960,00:06:21.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,so I must give it...
Dialogue: 0,00:06:21.400,00:06:22.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so let me see.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:29.280,00:06:34.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So f of x is defined in a and b.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:35.500,00:06:37.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,I simply evaluate it.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:38.740,00:06:40.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what did I do?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:40.280,00:06:45.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,I give it xa is x1 and b is x2.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:46.320,00:06:47.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I must have...
Dialogue: 0,00:06:47.440,00:06:56.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,I see.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:56.460,00:06:56.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Good point.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:57.420,00:07:01.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so I should have x equal to...
Dialogue: 0,00:07:01.400,00:07:03.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, let's do this again.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:06.060,00:07:07.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right, okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:07.480,00:07:09.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now I have the original x.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:10.180,00:07:11.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,I can do this.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:11.860,00:07:13.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,So my weights are now positive.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:15.000,00:07:17.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,And my xl is what I...
Dialogue: 0,00:07:17.440,00:07:18.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,expect.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:18.680,00:07:22.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now let's compute b left is equal to the same number.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:22.500,00:07:26.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is the integral of the function I wanted to integrate in the first interval.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:28.380,00:07:30.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so I can also have...
Dialogue: 0,00:07:31.560,00:07:37.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,my x right and w right being...
Dialogue: 0,00:07:38.620,00:07:43.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,the Gauss quadrature points and weights in the second interval.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:43.320,00:07:46.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so this is my second interval.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:47.440,00:07:52.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then I can also compute the right side of the quadrature.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:52.280,00:07:56.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Being summation of x right minus x2.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:56.440,00:07:59.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is actually...
Dialogue: 0,00:07:59.440,00:08:00.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Wait.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:00.440,00:08:02.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's xr.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:02.440,00:08:06.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think I made a mistake in here.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:06.440,00:08:11.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,What I needed actually is xi minus xi plus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:11.440,00:08:16.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because this basis function has to be zero at xi plus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:16.320,00:08:16.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:16.880,00:08:17.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:17.000,00:08:17.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:17.320,00:08:19.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,And there should be...
Dialogue: 0,00:08:19.320,00:08:21.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,There also should be...
Dialogue: 0,00:08:21.320,00:08:23.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Should there be a minus sign?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:23.320,00:08:25.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, there should be a minus sign here.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:25.320,00:08:29.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's actually xi plus 1 minus x.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:29.320,00:08:36.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is going to give me a 1 at xj and give me a 0 at xj plus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:36.320,00:08:37.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:37.320,00:08:39.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's a function that goes downwards.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:39.320,00:08:41.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:41.320,00:08:43.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now let's compute this function.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:43.320,00:08:45.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,xr should be...
Dialogue: 0,00:08:45.320,00:08:47.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,It should have x3 minus x1.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:47.320,00:09:01.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's going to be x3 minus xr divided by x3 minus x2 times sine of pi times xr times the wr.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:01.320,00:09:02.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:02.320,00:09:10.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is going to give me the right side of this b1.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:10.320,00:09:11.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:11.320,00:09:15.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I can have a b1.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:15.320,00:09:17.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's going to be equal to b left plus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:17.320,00:09:19.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this must be right.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:19.320,00:09:21.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Of course this only computes one entry.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:21.320,00:09:24.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's do a loop of computing all these entries.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:24.320,00:09:29.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's go for i goes from 1 to n minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:29.320,00:09:31.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:31.320,00:09:37.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,And so what I'm going to compute is b left.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:37.320,00:09:43.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,b left is going to be...
Dialogue: 0,00:09:43.320,00:09:44.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, sorry.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:44.320,00:09:46.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,I need to first compute the question.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:46.320,00:09:48.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to compute the quadrature weights.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:48.320,00:09:55.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,The quadrature weights on the left is going to be in between i and i plus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:55.320,00:09:56.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:56.320,00:10:05.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,And my x right and w right should be the quadrature points between i plus 1 and i plus 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:05.320,00:10:06.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:06.320,00:10:08.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this gives me the quadrature weights.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:08.320,00:10:12.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,And my...
Dialogue: 0,00:10:12.320,00:10:14.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,My integral on the left side of the...
Dialogue: 0,00:10:14.320,00:10:19.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,The integral on the right side of the grid point should be...
Dialogue: 0,00:10:19.320,00:10:28.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,The value of the basis function should be xl minus xi divided by xi plus 1 minus xi.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:28.320,00:10:36.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the linear function that goes from 0 to 1 when x goes from xi to xi plus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:36.320,00:10:40.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Times sine of pi times xl times wl.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:40.320,00:10:43.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is correct, I think.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:44.320,00:10:45.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:45.320,00:10:54.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,And br is going to be equal to the summation of x now i plus 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:54.320,00:10:55.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:55.320,00:11:01.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because I'm looking at the interval on the right side of this grid point.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:01.320,00:11:07.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I have xi plus 2 minus xi plus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:07.320,00:11:10.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is right.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:10.320,00:11:13.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,And my bi would be equal to bl plus br.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:14.320,00:11:17.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.

Dialogue: 0,00:12:47.320,00:12:48.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have x equals i, plus my diagonal terms and a equals a.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:48.320,00:12:49.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's, let's this first, a is equal to a, plus my diagonal terms and a is equal to
Dialogue: 0,00:12:49.560,00:12:57.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,a minus, no, I don't have these two times.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:57.440,00:12:58.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ok.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:58.440,00:13:01.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's my new a matrix.

Dialogue: 0,00:13:08.760,00:13:09.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And ...
Dialogue: 0,00:13:09.760,00:13:10.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Um.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:10.320,00:13:26.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,these and these are still correct this is the correct main diagonal right so we
Dialogue: 0,00:13:26.160,00:13:31.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,get a matrix that yeah looks looks like half the properties we expect all right
Dialogue: 0,00:13:31.940,00:13:40.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,so u is equal to a backslash B and let's try to plot this time solution
Dialogue: 0,00:13:40.700,00:13:48.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,let's plot it as what color let's plot it as a black okay so now the black line
Dialogue: 0,00:13:48.680,00:13:53.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,matches the analytical solution a lot better right so let's let's close this
Dialogue: 0,00:13:53.180,00:14:01.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,again and so this is numerical solution this is
Dialogue: 0,00:14:01.620,00:14:01.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,you
Dialogue: 0,00:14:01.940,00:14:08.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,analytical solution sorry let me hold on and plot the numerical solution again so
Dialogue: 0,00:14:08.780,00:14:15.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,now my numerical solution matches the analytical solution a lot better so we
Dialogue: 0,00:14:15.560,00:14:20.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,have demonstrated how to use finite element to solve the Poisson's equation
Dialogue: 0,00:14:20.100,00:14:25.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,with zero boundary conditions both for trivial right-hand side and for a
Dialogue: 0,00:14:25.180,00:14:29.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,non-trivial right-hand side all right and Gauss quadrature with five points
Dialogue: 0,00:14:29.540,00:14:31.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,seems to be very good already
Dialogue: 0,00:14:31.940,00:14:50.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,finally these are the bombs ok here you add any
Dialogue: 0,00:14:50.640,00:15:01.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,aggravating
