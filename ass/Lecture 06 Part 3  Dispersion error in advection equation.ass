Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:03.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you do this analysis, it's called modified equation analysis.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:04.040,00:00:09.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,You derive that, you derive, so instead of deriving a discrete scheme from the differential equation,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:09.480,00:00:14.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,you use the same Taylor series analysis to derive a differential equation from the scheme.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:15.680,00:00:21.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,And look at what is the leading term of this modified equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:21.520,00:00:22.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the modified equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:22.960,00:00:32.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,And what is the leading difference between the modified equation and the original equation?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:36.820,00:00:40.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,And in this case, the leading term is a dissipation.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:41.920,00:00:47.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,When the leading term is dissipation, you expect to see a lot of dissipation error in the solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:47.880,00:00:52.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,That almost as if you added a dissipation term into the differential equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:52.960,00:01:01.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, this other term, this term is called dispersion.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:03.920,00:01:06.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,It is a third order derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:07.720,00:01:13.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,In this case, it's almost overshadowed by the dissipation error,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:14.060,00:01:19.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,because the dissipation error is O delta x, the dispersion error is O delta x squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:19.640,00:01:19.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:21.820,00:01:22.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is there some case?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:22.960,00:01:27.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is where this is not overshadowed by the dissipation error.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:28.200,00:01:29.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,Central difference.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:33.280,00:01:34.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's right.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:35.360,00:01:42.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So to look at the effect of dispersion error, let's, instead of using the upwind difference,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:42.980,00:01:45.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,let's use the central difference to solve the same equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:47.840,00:01:52.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Central difference is Ui plus 1 minus Ui minus 1 divided by 2 delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:52.960,00:01:54.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So Ui plus 1 is equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:54.960,00:01:57.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,And again, we do Taylor series analysis.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:58.320,00:02:16.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ui plus 1 is equal to Ui plus delta x U prime plus half delta x squared U double prime plus delta x cubed U triple prime plus O delta x to the fourth.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:17.200,00:02:22.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ui minus 1 is equal to this minus delta x plus minus.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:22.960,00:02:27.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean, this is the same, the same, the same.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:28.080,00:02:28.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:30.160,00:02:31.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now we take the difference.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:33.080,00:02:39.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ui plus 1 minus Ui minus 1 divided by delta x is equal to this got canceled.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:40.240,00:02:41.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, 2 delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:41.820,00:02:45.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is not canceled, but the 2 delta x is canceled.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:45.540,00:02:47.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this term, we are having a Ui prime.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:48.680,00:02:49.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is canceled.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:50.320,00:02:51.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,This term is not canceled.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:51.900,00:02:52.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,It is canceled.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:53.120,00:02:54.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have a Ui prime.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:54.540,00:03:02.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,And it is divided by 2 delta x, which makes it delta x squared over 6 Ui triple prime.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:05.580,00:03:08.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,Plus O, in this case, O delta x cubed.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:09.060,00:03:11.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Don't forget, it is divided by delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:13.160,00:03:13.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:17.040,00:03:17.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:18.020,00:03:20.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,This fourth order is also canceled completely.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:20.300,00:03:20.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:20.800,00:03:32.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this turns out to be delta x to the fourth because U quad prime is canceled.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:34.420,00:03:35.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's a good point.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:36.420,00:03:40.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, if you look at the modified equation, it's partial U partial t.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:41.460,00:03:42.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is still here.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:42.700,00:03:45.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,Plus U partial U partial x.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:45.180,00:03:46.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is partial U partial x.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:46.380,00:03:50.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,And now plus U times delta x squared over 6.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:51.420,00:03:54.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's actually where this acting in this term is connected.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:54.460,00:04:08.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,And what
Dialogue: 0,00:04:08.900,00:04:09.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,is that?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:09.720,00:04:10.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what is this affection?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:10.860,00:04:12.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's modify that equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:12.820,00:04:14.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,Halo.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:14.820,00:04:43.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's this one. Let's copy this thing, paste it here, and call it dudt central. So we still have the same thing, but here it's u2 minus uand divided by 2 delta x, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:43.360,00:04:52.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,And here, instead of 2 to n, we have 2 to n minus 1, because we can't loop all the way to n. We can only loop to n minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:55.140,00:05:06.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Sorry, and this should be modified to i plus 1, so still to n, but like this is 3. And this is i minus 1, which still starts at 1, but ends at n minus 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:07.820,00:05:09.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Again, divide by 2 delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:11.700,00:05:12.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,And lastly,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:12.640,00:05:13.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,like,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:13.360,00:05:14.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,making them aligned.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:15.640,00:05:16.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,Lastly, we have
Dialogue: 0,00:05:16.980,00:05:18.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,u of
Dialogue: 0,00:05:18.280,00:05:21.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,1 minus u of
Dialogue: 0,00:05:21.400,00:05:22.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,n minus 1, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:23.080,00:05:25.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,At very end, u1 is i plus 1
Dialogue: 0,00:05:25.660,00:05:27.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,divided by
Dialogue: 0,00:05:27.540,00:05:29.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,2 delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:32.460,00:05:33.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:33.220,00:05:34.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,any bug you find on this?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:35.520,00:05:36.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,The name of the function.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:37.020,00:05:38.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, the name of the function, thank you.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:39.960,00:05:40.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,Central.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:40.520,00:05:40.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:40.760,00:05:41.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:42.700,00:05:43.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,Anything else?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:45.000,00:05:45.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's it?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:46.280,00:05:46.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:47.020,00:05:48.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's go back to the
Dialogue: 0,00:05:48.480,00:05:52.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,x equal to
Dialogue: 0,00:05:52.360,00:05:59.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,n equal to 100 case, because it's easier to see the smaller dispersion error in that case.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:00.480,00:06:05.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's take u0 to be the same thing, and od45, same thing.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:05.720,00:06:07.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,We integrate by one period.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:07.240,00:06:10.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's close the previous one and plot.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:10.760,00:06:11.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's take u0 first.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:11.760,00:06:21.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so that's still the analytical solution after the wave being advected for any integer period.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:21.640,00:06:23.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's hold on.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:23.640,00:06:25.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Hold off.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:25.640,00:06:33.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,And plot this first using red.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:33.640,00:06:35.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,No?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:35.640,00:06:37.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, I still did upwind.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:37.640,00:06:39.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, sorry.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:39.640,00:06:40.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:40.040,00:06:41.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think it's still the analytical solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:41.320,00:06:43.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Should be central.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:43.320,00:06:53.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so let's close this thing, plot u0 first and plot this using red.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:53.320,00:06:55.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,I didn't hold on.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:55.880,00:06:56.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Sorry.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:57.320,00:06:58.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,Plot this first.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:58.520,00:07:00.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Hold on.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:00.040,00:07:01.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,And plot this at red.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:01.880,00:07:02.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:03.720,00:07:06.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,You see, this is a lot more accurate, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:06.200,00:07:08.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, there is almost no difference.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:08.400,00:07:09.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, let's advect it for, let's say, 15,000.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:09.800,00:07:17.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,little bit more time so instead of 2 pi let's do 20 pi all right so we add back
Dialogue: 0,00:07:17.960,00:07:26.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,the whole thing over 10 periods and now let's take a look now after 10 periods
Dialogue: 0,00:07:26.840,00:07:36.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,the dispersion error is it's showing its effect so the red one that is close to
Dialogue: 0,00:07:36.200,00:07:43.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,blue is after one period the one that is away that looks a lot more less a lot less accurate
Dialogue: 0,00:07:43.720,00:07:48.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,is after 10 periods so what is the dispersion error doing
Dialogue: 0,00:07:56.440,00:07:59.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's introducing additional oscillations that's right
Dialogue: 0,00:08:00.920,00:08:04.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,and mathematically if you do a fourier series analysis
Dialogue: 0,00:08:05.960,00:08:06.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,it
Dialogue: 0,00:08:06.200,00:08:15.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,is adapting different wave numbers or different frequency of waves at different speeds so the
Dialogue: 0,00:08:15.400,00:08:21.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,first order derivative and that's all different frequencies at the same speed that is why it
Dialogue: 0,00:08:21.560,00:08:27.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,preserves the shape of the function and a third order derivative at that different frequencies at
Dialogue: 0,00:08:27.720,00:08:34.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,different speeds that is why it is creating oscillations this is even more obvious let's say
Dialogue: 0,00:08:34.520,00:08:35.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,let's take a different initial
Dialogue: 0,00:08:35.960,00:08:39.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,condition so u0 is equal to
Dialogue: 0,00:08:42.040,00:08:48.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,uh let's take this to be greater than 0.8 so let's see if that works
Dialogue: 0,00:08:50.440,00:08:58.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,so plot u0 so we get a wave of so so this is the operator that gives me zero or ones
Dialogue: 0,00:08:58.760,00:09:05.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,right it's okay so basically i get a bunch of one over here and all zeros elsewhere and
Dialogue: 0,00:09:05.080,00:09:13.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,start going to know if it's a good wave yeah something like this so let's take a look
Dialogue: 0,00:09:13.480,00:09:25.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,right let's look at the first one okay so Katr's nowPERFOR machine to figure that out
Dialogue: 0,00:09:26.040,00:09:28.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,there it is yeah it bulb okay
Dialogue: 0,00:09:28.360,00:09:32.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,well actually it Penghuang has a lot of different functional function
Dialogue: 0,00:09:32.080,00:09:33.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,entain a sleet
Dialogue: 0,00:09:33.560,00:09:39.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,of single and double data for T .
Dialogue: 0,00:09:39.160,00:09:45.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's do U equal to float U .
Dialogue: 0,00:09:45.200,00:09:48.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is that...
Dialogue: 0,00:09:48.120,00:09:50.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,No.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:50.320,00:09:52.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,Double.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:52.160,00:09:55.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, that works.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:55.940,00:09:58.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so now it works.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:58.720,00:10:04.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,And let's plot this after one period.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:04.300,00:10:12.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I forgot to hold on, but if you remember what U is, let's hold on and plot X and
Dialogue: 0,00:10:12.280,00:10:13.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,U .
Dialogue: 0,00:10:13.680,00:10:19.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So U is the blue, and the red is after one period.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:19.060,00:10:26.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,And now it is plain obvious that even after one period, we get wild oscillations almost
Dialogue: 0,00:10:26.280,00:10:28.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,everywhere.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:28.120,00:10:32.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the very high frequencies in the blue curve gets affected at very different speeds all
Dialogue: 0,00:10:32.740,00:10:34.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,over the domain.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:34.260,00:10:43.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's dispersion error.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:43.420,00:10:51.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,So when you are looking at a numerical solution, your own solver or other people's solver,
