Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:19.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's give that a try. So let's make another file, function dudt wave, and the t of u still, we have dudt.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:19.200,00:00:27.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this u may not be a good, let's do phi and psi.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:27.500,00:00:33.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's give that a try. dudt of phi and psi.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:33.840,00:00:37.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'll just write that as dudt.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:38.160,00:00:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So n is equal to length of phi psi over 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:46.820,00:00:48.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,So because phi and psi,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:49.200,00:00:54.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,is going to contain a variable that is discretized.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:56.600,00:00:59.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,That is, so here I use the u and k, but this is,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:00.700,00:01:06.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,yeah, so it contains the discretized phi and psi for all the spatial grid points.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:07.960,00:01:08.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:10.480,00:01:16.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,And phi is going to be equal to phi psi from 1 to n,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:16.720,00:01:19.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and psi is equal to phi psi,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:19.200,00:01:21.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,from n plus 1 to n.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:21.100,00:01:26.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is basically splitting the input variable into the two different variables.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:26.200,00:01:28.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Does it make sense?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:32.200,00:01:34.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's use central difference.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:34.200,00:01:40.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,And actually let me just copy what we did in this case.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:42.200,00:01:44.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Except for here we du dx.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:44.200,00:01:47.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,And in this case we need d.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:47.200,00:01:48.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,d.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:49.200,00:01:50.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,d is equal to phi dx.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:50.760,00:01:58.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,I would also want to say dx is equal to 2 pi over n.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:00.200,00:02:09.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,And let's do a find and replace u with phi.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:10.200,00:02:13.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,Replace all editor current file.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:15.860,00:02:17.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,Looking okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:19.200,00:02:30.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, here I actually saved it as dudt, so just to make it better, I will just rename
Dialogue: 0,00:02:30.200,00:02:35.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,it as ddt, because we are not using u here.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:35.200,00:02:47.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, ddt, not central, yeah, ddt central.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:47.160,00:02:50.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,I opened the wrong file, yes, I opened the wrong file.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:50.600,00:02:59.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is still ddt central, I wanted ddt wave.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:59.160,00:03:04.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:04.980,00:03:09.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,How do you do a replacement only in the selection?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:09.400,00:03:16.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,Anyway, so before I figure that out, I will just do a manual replacement.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:16.400,00:03:16.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:17.160,00:03:20.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's it, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:20.520,00:03:25.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have dphi dx and dpsi dx.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:25.720,00:03:31.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Both figured out.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:31.060,00:03:41.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,And now our dphi dt is equal to dpsi dx, dpsi dt is equal to dphi dx, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:41.480,00:03:46.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's our derivation of the wave equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:46.400,00:03:46.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:47.160,00:03:58.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the ddt is going to be, first I'm going to put, so in the beginning I have psi phi
Dialogue: 0,00:03:58.520,00:04:02.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,in the beginning, so dphi dt and dpsi dt.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:02.440,00:04:06.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's my output of the function.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:06.720,00:04:09.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:09.240,00:04:12.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's start with a phi being dpsi.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:12.320,00:04:13.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:13.320,00:04:14.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's my output of the function.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:14.320,00:04:15.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:15.320,00:04:16.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's start with a phi being dpsi dt.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:16.320,00:04:17.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:17.160,00:04:19.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to start with the same as my u0, maybe.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:19.780,00:04:24.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, my u0 was a bad one, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:24.600,00:04:25.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let me see.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:25.900,00:04:37.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,U0 is equal to, let's set my phi zero to be that, and the psi zero to be phi zero multiplied
Dialogue: 0,00:04:37.960,00:04:39.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,by zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:39.780,00:04:42.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this corresponds to a wave that is initially phi.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:42.280,00:04:43.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:43.280,00:04:45.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now it's going to be a wave that is a very small wave.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:45.280,00:04:46.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:46.280,00:04:52.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,initially flat because du dx is initially equal to zero so the whole thing is flat the whole
Dialogue: 0,00:04:52.920,00:04:59.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,solution is zero but with the initial velocity with the initial d ud t right that is like this
Dialogue: 0,00:04:59.800,00:05:16.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,wave okay so let's do a t and uh phi and psi equal to od 45 of ddt wave zero so how long do
Dialogue: 0,00:05:16.360,00:05:25.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,we want to integrate it still just uh let's let's do pi just to see what do we get and we put phi
Dialogue: 0,00:05:25.480,00:05:29.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,first and psi second oh zero great
Dialogue: 0,00:05:29.800,00:05:32.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,okay now we solved it
Dialogue: 0,00:05:32.840,00:05:42.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,this is our solution we are only interested in the very last part so let's just plot it uh to see
Dialogue: 0,00:05:42.080,00:05:55.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,x and phi psi and and one to a hundred right so that's our phi
Dialogue: 0,00:05:55.400,00:05:59.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,oh i didn't
Dialogue: 0,00:05:59.800,00:06:00.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,close the previous one
Dialogue: 0,00:06:05.200,00:06:06.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,that doesn't look good
Dialogue: 0,00:06:09.040,00:06:12.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,i must have made an error somewhere
Dialogue: 0,00:06:13.920,00:06:26.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,okay so let's plot phi zero what is phi zero psi zero is zero okay let me see ddt wave
Dialogue: 0,00:06:29.800,00:06:36.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,to end n plus one to the end
Dialogue: 0,00:06:47.680,00:06:50.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,so if i do this from one direction to the other
Dialogue: 0,00:06:52.600,00:06:56.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,my λ 1 to the partial and when i do this from one direction to the other dangling to for right i'm wouldn't
Dialogue: 0,00:06:56.540,00:07:03.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,so if I do this from 101 to 200 what is it giving us?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:03.540,00:07:16.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,I don't know if it makes a difference but when you parse the 5 aside from the initial
Dialogue: 0,00:07:16.540,00:07:24.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,values you're referring to a vector index and you're providing a matrix so instead of
Dialogue: 0,00:07:24.540,00:07:35.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,the semicolon you can call the ODE.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:35.540,00:07:37.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,You mean when I'm doing here?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:37.540,00:07:40.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, I don't know if that would...
Dialogue: 0,00:07:40.540,00:07:45.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, thank you, yeah, that's right.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:45.540,00:07:47.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's right.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:47.540,00:07:48.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's what I should do.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:48.540,00:07:50.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:50.540,00:07:53.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's see, plot the...
Dialogue: 0,00:07:53.540,00:07:54.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now...
Dialogue: 0,00:07:54.540,00:07:56.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now that's a lot better.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:56.540,00:07:57.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:57.540,00:08:05.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,And let's plot the side...
Dialogue: 0,00:08:05.540,00:08:07.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, okay, that's good.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:07.540,00:08:12.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's do an animation of how this is going to work.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:12.540,00:08:14.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's do T...
Dialogue: 0,00:08:14.540,00:08:19.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's do I goes from 1 to 1000.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:19.540,00:08:23.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's actually keep this going.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:23.540,00:08:26.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's do this.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:26.540,00:08:27.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, sorry.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:27.540,00:08:36.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's do 5 psi 0 equal to what we had in the beginning.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:36.540,00:08:38.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:38.540,00:08:42.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,And...
Dialogue: 0,00:08:42.540,00:08:50.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's do T and 5 psi is equal to that ODE 45.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:50.540,00:08:54.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:54.540,00:08:57.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,And let's only time integrate it for a short time.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:57.540,00:09:03.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So 0 to, let's say, 0.1.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:03.540,00:09:07.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,5 psi 0 as initial condition.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:07.540,00:09:17.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I'd like to hold off and plot x and 5 psi...
Dialogue: 0,00:09:17.540,00:09:18.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:18.540,00:09:21.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's do 5 psi 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:21.540,00:09:28.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we are going to overwrite the initial condition using the last solution of ODE 45.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:28.540,00:09:35.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we are going to plot x with 5 psi 0, 1 to 100.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:35.540,00:09:41.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's use blue and hold on.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:41.540,00:09:47.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Plot x 5 psi 0 of 101 to 200.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:47.540,00:09:49.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's do red.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:49.540,00:09:54.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,And let's pause for a little bit.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:54.540,00:09:57.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Pause.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:57.540,00:09:59.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Do I need to draw?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:59.540,00:10:00.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Maybe I don't.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:00.540,00:10:01.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,And...
Dialogue: 0,00:10:01.540,00:10:05.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's see what do we get.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:05.540,00:10:11.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's the solution of the wave equation we see.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:11.540,00:10:16.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because it's periodic, basically the wave goes out and comes back from the other side.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:17.540,00:10:25.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So remember when we look at the eigenvalues of the matrix, we get 1 and minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:25.540,00:10:27.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:27.540,00:10:36.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,What that means is that similar to a linear advection equation which only has one velocity going towards the right,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:36.540,00:10:40.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,in this equation we essentially have two velocities.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:40.540,00:10:46.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,One going towards the right with velocity 1, another going towards the left at velocity 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:46.540,00:10:54.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's a superposition of linear advection equations with 1 and minus 1 velocities.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:54.540,00:10:59.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,And of course now we are seeing, because we are doing this for so long,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:59.540,00:11:04.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,and using central difference, which error is taking its toll over here?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:04.540,00:11:06.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Dispersion error.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:06.540,00:11:07.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Dispersion error, right.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:07.540,00:11:14.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we are seeing some of the frequencies are probably not at the right place anymore after evolving for so long.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:14.540,00:11:15.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,But because we are using central difference, we are seeing that the frequencies are probably not at the right place anymore after evolving for so long.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:15.540,00:11:22.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,But because we are using central difference scheme, there is not much, actually not any dissipation error in this numerical solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:22.540,00:11:25.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,The wave keeps going.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:25.540,00:11:27.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:27.540,00:11:29.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any questions about this?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:29.540,00:11:31.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:31.540,00:11:35.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,What is the physical difference between a dissipation error and a dispersion error?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:35.540,00:11:39.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,What is the physical difference?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:39.540,00:11:43.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Dissipation, it's...
Dialogue: 0,00:11:43.540,00:11:45.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I think there is a...
Dialogue: 0,00:11:45.540,00:11:49.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the physical meaning of what is dissipation, right,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:49.540,00:11:57.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean when you say dissipation error, that means you have a numerical error, not physical, that acts like a dissipation.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:57.540,00:12:00.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So...
Dialogue: 0,00:12:00.540,00:12:01.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:01.540,00:12:04.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Dissipation means it is diffusing things.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:04.540,00:12:08.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,It is like the dissipation of heat, for example.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:08.540,00:12:14.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Dissipation of heat is if you have a very hot object, the heat is going to dissipate.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:14.540,00:12:19.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,It means it is going to transfer the high temperature region into the lower temperature regions.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:19.540,00:12:21.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Entropy increases.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:21.540,00:12:29.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,The hot thing is going to cool down and the cold thing is going to heat up due to dissipation of heat.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:29.540,00:12:31.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Dispersion is different.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:31.540,00:12:39.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Dispersion maintains how much energy or how much almost kinetic energy you have.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:39.540,00:12:42.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,But like you have different components of the energy.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:42.540,00:12:46.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,You have different components of the energy going into different places.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:46.540,00:12:54.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's roughly my understanding of what dissipation and dispersion means.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:54.540,00:12:58.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:12:58.540,00:13:04.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:04.540,00:13:06.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:06.540,00:13:08.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,How do I go back to you?
Dialogue: 0,00:13:08.540,00:13:10.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Good question.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:10.540,00:13:15.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,The best way to go back to you is to look at both of the solutions.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:15.540,00:13:17.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,For example, you have du dx.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:17.540,00:13:18.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:13:18.540,00:13:30.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you integrate over the spatial domain for du dx, you are going to recover the solution u up to a constant.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:30.540,00:13:37.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,And exactly what constant we are recovering, we need to look at the other component, du dt.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:37.540,00:13:40.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,To decide from the last time step what is the constant.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:40.540,00:13:42.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,To the next time step, what is the constant?
Dialogue: 0,00:13:42.540,00:13:43.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:13:43.540,00:13:48.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we know, for example, we know the evolution of du dx.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:48.540,00:13:50.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,We know the value of du dt.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:50.540,00:13:55.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we know the averaged, spatially averaged du dt.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:55.540,00:14:02.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that is going to give us how the constant term, how the average of u is going to evolve as a function of time.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:02.540,00:14:06.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you need to combine, again, combine these two solutions to recover the u.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:06.540,00:14:09.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any other questions?
Dialogue: 0,00:14:09.540,00:14:10.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:10.540,00:14:11.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any other questions?
Dialogue: 0,00:14:11.540,00:14:12.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:12.540,00:14:13.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Thank you.
