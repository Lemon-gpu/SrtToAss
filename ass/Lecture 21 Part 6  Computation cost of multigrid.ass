Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:02.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,How costly is multigrid?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:04.440,00:00:10.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,And here, we are going to look at one-dimensional, two-dimensional, and three-dimensional problems.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:10.640,00:00:15.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, this is the multigrid cycle we have performed.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:16.780,00:00:19.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,We perform a smoothing on the fine grid.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:20.960,00:00:26.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, let's say the cost is proportional on a one-dimensional grid.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:26.240,00:00:30.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is proportional to n, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:30.100,00:00:33.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, let's say alpha n is the pre-smoothing on the fine grid.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:34.680,00:00:40.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,And interpolation cost is very similar to the smoothing iterations.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:40.540,00:00:43.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's basically proportional to the number of grid points.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:43.820,00:00:48.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is proportional to n over 2 for a one-dimensional grid.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:48.800,00:00:50.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is proportional to n over 4.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:51.100,00:00:53.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is proportional to n over 8.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:53.220,00:00:56.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,And coming back, this is also n.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:56.500,00:01:01.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,n over 4, n over 2, and n, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:01.120,00:01:08.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, one multigrid cycle is going to have a cost of a constant times n,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:09.540,00:01:17.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,plus half n, plus a fourth n, plus n over 8.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:17.800,00:01:22.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you have more grids, it will be n over 16, etc., etc.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:24.020,00:01:26.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you add all these up,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:27.060,00:01:30.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,and you want to approximate it by something,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:30.620,00:01:32.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,what would it look like?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:35.060,00:01:39.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,n of 1 plus half plus a fourth plus 8.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:40.180,00:01:41.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,Do you recognize this series?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:43.580,00:01:45.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,What's the summation of the series?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:47.900,00:01:49.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,About 2, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:49.180,00:01:54.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, that's approximately twice the cost
Dialogue: 0,00:01:54.420,00:01:56.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,of only doing...
Dialogue: 0,00:01:56.240,00:01:58.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,the fine-grid iterations.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:58.240,00:02:00.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you don't go to the cost grid,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:00.240,00:02:04.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,you just perform the iterations you would do on the fine-grid.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:04.240,00:02:09.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,You would be saving only half of the computation cost.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:11.080,00:02:17.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if we only do these 10 Jacobi or Gauss-Seidel iterations on the finest grid,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:17.080,00:02:21.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,you probably see the solution not converging at all.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:21.080,00:02:23.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Like, you only get a few lines.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:24.620,00:02:25.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:25.120,00:02:26.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,so, that's the solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:26.020,00:02:28.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, that's not the whole story yet,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:28.020,00:02:32.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,if you look at it on the two-dimensional problem.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:32.020,00:02:34.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, this is 1b.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:34.020,00:02:38.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,On the two-dimensional problem, just like what we just solved.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:38.020,00:02:46.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,And imagine n is the total number of grid points on the finest grid.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:46.020,00:02:48.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,The series is different.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:48.020,00:02:50.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, this is still n.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:50.020,00:02:54.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,When you go to a cost grid, the grid is four times smaller.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:54.020,00:02:54.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:54.520,00:02:55.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,So,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:55.020,00:02:59.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,n over 4 and n over 16, etc.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:59.020,00:03:08.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, what we would get in the 2D is 1 over 4, 1 over 16, plus etc.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:10.020,00:03:14.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well, it's n times 1 over 1 minus 1 fourth.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:14.020,00:03:18.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, that's about 4 over 3 times n.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:18.020,00:03:23.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, this is only a little bit more expensive than doing this thing,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:23.020,00:03:26.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,doing only the fine grid operations.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:26.020,00:03:27.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:27.020,00:03:28.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:28.020,00:03:36.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, furthermore, as you can imagine, if I go to 3D, that'll be even more cheaper.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:36.020,00:03:40.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, the next grid is an eighth as expensive.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:40.020,00:03:44.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the next one is 64 as expensive.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:44.020,00:03:47.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is going to be 1 minus eighth.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:47.020,00:03:51.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that'll be 8 over 7 times n.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:51.020,00:03:52.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, again, a little bit more expensive.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:53.020,00:03:57.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,More expensive than doing this only on the fine grid.
