Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:21.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the central flux scheme works in the following way. So I'm going to use fi plus 1 to be equal to an average between fi and fi plus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:21.080,00:00:33.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Where for each fi is equal to the flux function, which is usually an analytical function or something we know how to compute over the cell average.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:34.540,00:00:47.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so this is something I can use as an example to illustrate how a finite difference scheme works.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:47.200,00:00:48.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to write a function.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:49.740,00:00:51.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,d dt central.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:51.080,00:00:51.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,d dt central.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:53.720,00:00:56.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the input.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:57.220,00:01:00.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's again, to make it simple, we use OD45.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:00.940,00:01:05.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the time, the input of the function is t and u.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:09.120,00:01:14.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So our u is no longer a time, no longer the function at the grid points.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:15.040,00:01:17.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,It is these cell averages.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:17.240,00:01:21.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So my u is actually, to make it clear, let's actually.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:21.280,00:01:22.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Give it u bar.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:22.460,00:01:23.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's name it u bar.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:23.980,00:01:26.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,So du bar dt is the output.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:27.620,00:01:27.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:28.580,00:01:32.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,So first of all, we can evaluate the fi's.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:32.980,00:01:33.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:33.820,00:01:36.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's say f is equal to.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:37.920,00:01:40.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's use the Berger's equation as an example.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:40.660,00:01:42.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,u bar square over 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:42.560,00:01:44.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's the Berger's flux.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:48.120,00:01:50.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you want to change the equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:50.420,00:01:51.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,To solve another.

Dialogue: 0,00:01:51.180,00:01:53.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is the only line of code you have to change.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:53.980,00:01:57.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you want to solve another scalar consideration equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:57.080,00:01:58.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,The only one.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:58.080,00:02:00.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's the only line you have to change.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:00.080,00:02:01.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:01.080,00:02:02.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:02.080,00:02:06.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let me call this f bar because they are.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:06.080,00:02:11.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Values evaluated over the cell averages.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:11.080,00:02:19.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now the next step is to compute the f at the cell interfaces or at the grid points.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:19.080,00:02:20.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:20.080,00:02:21.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:21.080,00:02:23.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the f interface.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:23.080,00:02:25.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is equal to.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:25.080,00:02:26.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,What.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:26.080,00:02:27.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,We did say.

Dialogue: 0,00:05:50.680,00:05:57.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,So taking f1 is an appropriate way to specify the boundary condition

Dialogue: 0,00:06:09.560,00:06:16.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,But it wouldn't allow you to specify the boundary condition

Dialogue: 0,00:06:22.740,00:06:28.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Actually, if you do that, you are practically setting a zero Newman boundary condition,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:29.060,00:06:33.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,which means the local derivative of u to x is equal to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:33.980,00:06:37.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,It basically says that, okay, the characteristics is going into the domain,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:37.600,00:06:39.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,but I'm going to just use...
Dialogue: 0,00:06:39.560,00:06:43.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm going to use the flux at the first cell, which is actually inside the domain.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:44.780,00:06:50.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is basically saying my outside the domain is equal to the inside of the domain locally.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:50.620,00:06:52.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it sets a zero Newman boundary condition.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:55.260,00:06:59.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if that's not what you want, then you need to pick another way.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:00.900,00:07:05.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,It does, but it's a less accurate scheme
Dialogue: 0,00:07:06.960,00:07:09.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,because my boundary condition is u.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:09.560,00:07:12.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you add x equal to zero is equal to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:12.260,00:07:16.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's not the average in the first cell is equal to zero, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:16.980,00:07:20.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's so setting doing what you are suggesting is perfectly fine.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:20.680,00:07:23.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,Just a less accurate discretization.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:23.720,00:07:32.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what you did here, I'm wondering why doesn't that indicate boundary conditions of flux in and out of the volume being zero?

Dialogue: 0,00:07:55.680,00:07:57.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I need a flux at this point.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:57.500,00:07:59.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,I also need a flux at this point.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:59.480,00:08:03.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what I'm doing is I'm setting the flux here and the flux here to be zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:04.200,00:08:06.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,So does that mean nothing is entering or exiting?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:06.780,00:08:14.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, no flux is entering or exiting the domain, which is corresponding to a u equal to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:14.680,00:08:21.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm basically setting u at this grid point is equal to zero and u at this grid point is equal to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:22.080,00:08:24.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,It doesn't sound like you are convinced.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:25.580,00:08:30.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So how are we going to model flux into or out of the body?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:31.360,00:08:35.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,Isn't that the beginning of the model of that?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:36.780,00:08:43.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,If the characteristics goes into the domain, I would be setting the flux to f of u.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:44.520,00:08:48.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,If the flux is going out of the domain, if the characteristics is going out of the domain,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:48.880,00:08:54.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,I should be evaluating f of u inside the domain.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:56.080,00:08:58.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is that what you are asking?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:59.120,00:08:59.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think so.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:00.000,00:09:00.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:00.260,00:09:01.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:02.100,00:09:06.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I was just trying to avoid having this discussion.

Dialogue: 0,00:12:10.420,00:12:14.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright, my u is going to be 41 by 100
Dialogue: 0,00:12:14.560,00:12:21.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,matrix. Let me actually get my u x-bar, so
Dialogue: 0,00:12:21.200,00:12:22.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,x at the cell interfaces.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:22.940,00:12:26.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,Just to make the plotting a
Dialogue: 0,00:12:26.400,00:12:29.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,little bit easier. It's equal to x interface
Dialogue: 0,00:12:29.160,00:12:33.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,1 to n minus 1 plus x interface 2 to the
Dialogue: 0,00:12:33.980,00:12:38.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,end, divided by 2 and I'll just plot x-bar
Dialogue: 0,00:12:38.720,00:12:43.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,and u. Alright, so I'm plotting the
Dialogue: 0,00:12:43.460,00:12:46.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,evolution of the solution. Initially it's
Dialogue: 0,00:12:46.160,00:12:49.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,a sine curve, it's this one, and after
Dialogue: 0,00:12:49.640,00:12:52.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,time goes, this becomes steeper
Dialogue: 0,00:12:52.820,00:12:52.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,still.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:52.900,00:12:52.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to plot the solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:52.940,00:12:53.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is going to be a sine curve, it's
Dialogue: 0,00:12:53.940,00:12:54.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,going to be a sine curve and the wave
Dialogue: 0,00:12:54.940,00:12:56.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,goes steeper and the monotonically
Dialogue: 0,00:12:56.940,00:12:59.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,increasing parts become shallower. This
Dialogue: 0,00:12:59.380,00:13:01.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,is because when u is positive the wave
Dialogue: 0,00:13:01.180,00:13:02.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,goes towards the right, when u is
Dialogue: 0,00:13:02.600,00:13:04.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,negative the wave goes towards the left.
