Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:01.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then, the interior of that circle?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:03.880,00:00:07.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes, everything interior of that circle is the stability region.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:07.960,00:00:08.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if, yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:09.440,00:00:15.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you are exactly on the edge of the circle, then if you look at the error equation,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:16.560,00:00:19.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,the error is going to linearly amplify.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:19.960,00:00:26.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because whatever error you have previously, you have the same amount of error in your next iteration
Dialogue: 0,00:00:26.680,00:00:30.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,plus the additional contribution of the error from the truncation.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:31.100,00:00:36.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that means the worst-case scenario in the growth of the error is going to be linear,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:36.620,00:00:38.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,but it's still going to be unbounded.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:38.440,00:00:43.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's a lot better than the exponential growth you're going to have if you are outside the circle,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:44.180,00:00:46.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,but you still can have unbounded growth.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:47.780,00:00:51.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,While if you are within the circle, then if you look at the error equation,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:51.940,00:00:56.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,the error without contribution from the truncation error is going to shrink
Dialogue: 0,00:00:56.460,00:00:56.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,from the exponential growth.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:56.680,00:00:57.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's the problem for each time step.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:58.300,00:01:01.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,So even with the addition of the truncation error every time step,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:02.240,00:01:04.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,your solution error is going to stay bounded.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:06.600,00:01:11.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the edge of the circle is kind of a boundary, like borderline case.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:12.260,00:01:19.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this x, when we are looking at an ODE, is just a notation for, like, a single variable of time.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:20.440,00:01:22.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's the solution of the ODE.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:22.960,00:01:25.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's not, yeah, so it's not positioned.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:25.520,00:01:26.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,Sorry for the confusion.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:26.680,00:01:27.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,Potential confusion.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:27.960,00:01:35.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,So when we are analyzing ODE, we can use x as a dependent variable of t.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:36.220,00:01:39.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,But when we get to the PDE, x becomes an independent variable.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:41.680,00:01:46.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's, yeah, so let's distinguish the ODE case from the PDE analysis.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:47.840,00:01:47.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:47.980,00:01:49.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then we can also get k.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:50.060,00:01:54.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, also again, in the ODE analysis, we use the k to denote time step.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:55.300,00:01:56.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,And when we become...
Dialogue: 0,00:01:56.460,00:02:00.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,We go to the PDE case, we can no longer use k to denote time step,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:00.320,00:02:03.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we use m to denote time step.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:03.640,00:02:09.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's make this forward ODE analysis separate.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:09.440,00:02:10.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's draw a box.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:11.320,00:02:15.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is x of t, not space.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:17.280,00:02:23.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,k is the time step, not space.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:24.520,00:02:24.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:24.780,00:02:24.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:26.460,00:02:28.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,Make sure, like, when we are looking at ODE,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:28.620,00:02:34.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,the set of notation we can use is a lot different,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:35.160,00:02:40.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,just because there are so many more variables we have to use in PDEs.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:42.640,00:02:43.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:44.600,00:02:45.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any other questions?
