Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:10.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,so the project is not completely given out yet there is a still a question that is not given
Dialogue: 0,00:00:10.200,00:00:16.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,but if you look at the government equations and the government equations particularly looks for
Dialogue: 0,00:00:16.620,00:00:27.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,supersonic flows so we have a equation like that it should be equal to zero all right and supersonic
Dialogue: 0,00:00:27.720,00:00:37.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,flows means this M infinity means the how much faster is the flow compared to the speed of sound
Dialogue: 0,00:00:37.620,00:00:46.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,so it is a number that is greater than one can you see the similarity between this equation and
Dialogue: 0,00:00:46.020,00:00:57.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,the equation we just looked at it's similar except for one major difference
Dialogue: 0,00:00:57.700,00:01:06.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's there is no time right but instead the spatial derivative term have a negative sign
Dialogue: 0,00:01:06.760,00:01:13.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,between X and Y and Z because M infinity is greater than one this term is actually negative
Dialogue: 0,00:01:13.640,00:01:19.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,these two terms are positive if you move the negative terms to the other side of the equation
Dialogue: 0,00:01:19.420,00:01:25.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,which makes it positive it's the same as our wave equation which goes on in time
Dialogue: 0,00:01:27.700,00:01:39.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,so we can perfectly treat this as a time integration differential equation but like instead of
Dialogue: 0,00:01:39.040,00:01:48.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,integrating time we're integrating X all right so now we are getting to the domain when there is the
Dialogue: 0,00:01:48.340,00:01:55.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,difference between now we have this we can see that the difference between what we call hyperbolic
Dialogue: 0,00:01:55.340,00:01:57.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,equations and
Dialogue: 0,00:01:57.700,00:02:05.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,elliptic equations it's not just the fact that hyperbolic equations has a time in it while
Dialogue: 0,00:02:05.920,00:02:12.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,elliptic equation doesn't have a time it's only a spatial thing it's actually more mathematical than
Dialogue: 0,00:02:12.640,00:02:20.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,that for example this equation has no time in it but the fact it is a hyperbolic equation means it
Dialogue: 0,00:02:20.980,00:02:27.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,means that you can treat the X dimension as a time and solve the equation using time integration
Dialogue: 0,00:02:27.700,00:02:30.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,so it's essentially only the number of times tangential to the Nosmosis equation
Dialogue: 0,00:02:34.340,00:02:38.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,so let's say that the N is nothing but the decimal point that happened and that we must
Dialogue: 0,00:02:38.220,00:02:41.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,integrate the N teddy bit망 to get the percent of times N in our x-ング forecast
Dialogue: 0,00:02:41.060,00:02:44.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,so the N possession of the x-eng of thenight is nothing
Dialogue: 0,00:02:44.580,00:02:50.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,only the correct solution part of the equation half and half wheel the momentum of and that's
Dialogue: 0,00:02:50.380,00:02:53.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,not the case you make an equation which is indeed lambda over the time except that very
Dialogue: 0,00:02:53.980,00:02:56.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,nearly przykład
Dialogue: 0,00:02:57.700,00:03:03.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,that X after where you put the perturbation and by after it doesn't mean
Dialogue: 0,00:03:03.940,00:03:10.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,time it means the X location right so if you you can you can look at some of the
Dialogue: 0,00:03:10.960,00:03:16.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,pictures I included these are not linearized equations these are real
Dialogue: 0,00:03:16.480,00:03:22.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,experiments so so the existence of this airplane actually is not felt by the
Dialogue: 0,00:03:22.960,00:03:33.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,flow for X locations smaller than where this thing is so so if you put a
Dialogue: 0,00:03:33.100,00:03:36.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,per base in here so think of this entire airplane as a perturbation this
Dialogue: 0,00:03:36.700,00:03:41.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,perturbation is not going to influence the flowfield anywhere that is upstream
Dialogue: 0,00:03:41.100,00:03:47.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,so this is characteristics of a hyperbolic equation where you can think
Dialogue: 0,00:03:47.800,00:03:52.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,of one of the dimensions as time where the domain of influence only happens
Dialogue: 0,00:03:52.860,00:03:52.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,continuing on from国界的波波磁相对比就相反了
Dialogue: 0,00:03:52.960,00:03:54.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,after that time.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:55.980,00:03:58.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Several other pictures are like that.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:00.060,00:04:01.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the question is,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:02.580,00:04:05.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,do the transformation of variables
Dialogue: 0,00:04:05.220,00:04:07.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,and derive a system of equations you can solve?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:09.540,00:04:12.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,And consider a lot simplified two-dimensional problem
Dialogue: 0,00:04:12.680,00:04:16.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,and try to gain some intuition from the pictures you use
Dialogue: 0,00:04:16.700,00:04:18.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,and derive an analytical solution
Dialogue: 0,00:04:18.920,00:04:20.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,for the two-dimensional case.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:20.600,00:04:25.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,And design a solver to solve this two-dimensional,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:26.520,00:04:28.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean, no, the solver is actually,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:28.460,00:04:31.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,so design a solver for the two-dimensional problem
Dialogue: 0,00:04:31.380,00:04:36.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,and justify the use of numerical schemes in the solver.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:38.500,00:04:40.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,And compare the solution
Dialogue: 0,00:04:40.860,00:04:44.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,with the analytical solution you derived.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:44.240,00:04:45.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right, so play around
Dialogue: 0,00:04:45.900,00:04:48.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,with some supersonic flow problems.
