Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:09.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,So then the other form is the general form PDE. This is also a template and the
Dialogue: 0,00:00:09.660,00:00:18.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,template is this first equation. So it's shorter, it has fewer terms, but it's
Dialogue: 0,00:00:18.760,00:00:26.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,more general. Basically what we specify here is E, D, and gamma,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:26.340,00:00:31.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,applicate gamma, and the source term. And then the same templates, you have
Dialogue: 0,00:00:31.620,00:00:38.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,templates for boundary conditions. So let's see how this will fit. If you
Dialogue: 0,00:00:38.280,00:00:44.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,compare for example the general form template and the coefficient form
Dialogue: 0,00:00:44.760,00:00:53.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,template, the coefficient form, if you have a source term, I mean an absorption
Dialogue: 0,00:00:53.280,00:00:56.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,term like Au, for example, there isn't really a way
Dialogue: 0,00:00:56.320,00:01:00.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,to put that term in the journal form, but what can you
Dialogue: 0,00:01:00.920,00:01:03.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,do? You can always move it to the source term. The source
Dialogue: 0,00:01:03.720,00:01:05.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,term can take anything.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:05.460,00:01:08.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,You can write anything that didn't fit in the template,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:08.780,00:01:12.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,you can fit it into the source term.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:12.180,00:01:16.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,But either of these two templates, you can use them.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:16.920,00:01:22.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,But then in the WIT form, what you get is nothing.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:22.260,00:01:26.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,You get blank, and you have to directly specify your WIT form.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:26.960,00:01:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So here, you're getting more, basically you're removing the
Dialogue: 0,00:01:32.000,00:01:35.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,training wheels in terms of how much control you have, but then
Dialogue: 0,00:01:35.060,00:01:38.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,of course when you are working with the WIT form, you need to
Dialogue: 0,00:01:38.300,00:01:43.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,be familiar, you need to be comfortable with first taking
Dialogue: 0,00:01:43.920,00:01:47.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,the strong form, deriving it into a WIT form, but you get
Dialogue: 0,00:01:47.700,00:01:49.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,extreme flexibility.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:49.100,00:01:52.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Since there is no template, you can do whatever you want.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:52.220,00:01:52.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:52.260,00:02:01.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,I should probably skip this slide.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:01.800,00:02:03.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,You have seen this, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:03.220,00:02:05.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,You start with strong form.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:05.000,00:02:08.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,If the strong form was zero, you can multiply it by any
Dialogue: 0,00:02:08.200,00:02:11.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,weighting function, and it should be zero everywhere.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:11.100,00:02:13.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you integrated it, it should be zero for any weighting
Dialogue: 0,00:02:13.660,00:02:14.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,function.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:14.560,00:02:18.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Of course, you pick the space of the weighting and the
Dialogue: 0,00:02:18.860,00:02:22.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,solution, but skipping that.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:22.220,00:02:31.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you can use integration by parts, Gauss divergence theorem
Dialogue: 0,00:02:31.760,00:02:36.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,to move this to the boundary, and that's what you will have
Dialogue: 0,00:02:36.360,00:02:37.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,for the WIT form.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:37.460,00:02:42.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,The only thing is now how do I specify the W's when you are
Dialogue: 0,00:02:42.460,00:02:46.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,specifying, now when you are typing, so far we were typing
Dialogue: 0,00:02:46.020,00:02:50.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,quantities in terms of the dependent variables.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:50.860,00:02:52.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,So saying U.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:52.180,00:02:55.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you are solving for U or T, if you are solving for T.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:55.620,00:02:59.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,But now here, we have a second variable, and the way you specify
Dialogue: 0,00:02:59.920,00:03:04.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,in console is if you call the variable U, then when you want
Dialogue: 0,00:03:04.480,00:03:09.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,to access the weighting function associated with that equation,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:09.220,00:03:11.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,you're going to say test of U.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:11.280,00:03:17.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,So or if your independent variable was M, then for W, you
Dialogue: 0,00:03:17.580,00:03:22.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,will write test M. So the test operator basically
Dialogue: 0,00:03:22.140,00:03:27.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,says I am taking the weighting function associated with this
Dialogue: 0,00:03:27.180,00:03:28.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,primary variable.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:28.180,00:03:33.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,There is a blog article if you are interested in this that
Dialogue: 0,00:03:33.600,00:03:38.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,explains in detail how to implement WIT forms.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:38.800,00:03:42.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,But you basically have a choice between WIT form, strong form,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:42.180,00:03:47.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,and for the strong form, you can have the coefficient form, the
Dialogue: 0,00:03:47.900,00:03:49.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,general form, and other forms as well.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:49.880,00:03:52.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,Like for example, you can do the classical
Dialogue: 0,00:03:52.140,00:03:56.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,PDA interfaces for things like Laplace equation, which are
Dialogue: 0,00:03:56.300,00:03:58.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,commonly encountered.
