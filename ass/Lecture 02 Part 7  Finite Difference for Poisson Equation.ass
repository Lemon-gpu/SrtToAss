Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:12.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,Remember elliptic equations is almost like a special case for the heat equation, x squared,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:12.500,00:00:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,except for two differences.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:22.000,00:00:31.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,One difference is that I'm going to add f of x onto the right hand side.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:31.000,00:00:36.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,The other difference is I'm going to make this term equal to zero, which makes it equilibrium.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:36.080,00:00:40.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to make it equal to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:40.880,00:00:49.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,We already discussed how to discretize this term, and do we know how do we add a function

Dialogue: 0,00:00:54.200,00:00:54.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:54.340,00:00:55.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we already discussed this term.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:56.040,00:01:04.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,If the left hand side is equal to zero, we get a vector of zeros, which replaces d u d t,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:04.960,00:01:15.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,d vector u d t, equal to a matrix, let me just call it a, times the same vector u.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:15.540,00:01:18.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,So u1, et cetera, to u n minus one.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:18.340,00:01:21.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if we have boundary conditions, we're going to say that we're going to have a vector
Dialogue: 0,00:01:21.880,00:01:21.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,u 1, et cetera, to u n minus one.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:21.980,00:01:32.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,going to be adding, we are going to be adding let's say a b1 0 and b n minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:32.680,00:01:42.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right? So how do we add this f of x onto this equation? Yeah?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:42.680,00:01:47.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's just a vector with the sampling point of f.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:47.680,00:01:56.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Exactly. It's just a vector of the samples of f at delta x, 2 delta x, 3 delta x, etc.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:56.680,00:02:01.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we are going to be discretizing f using the same way.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:01.680,00:02:07.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,f is defined as f at i delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:07.680,00:02:16.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now this, instead of an ODE, what we get?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:16.680,00:02:17.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,We get a linear equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:17.680,00:02:19.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:19.680,00:02:25.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ax plus, if you call this just a vector c,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:25.680,00:02:29.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,ax plus au plus c equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:29.680,00:02:32.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,In MATLAB, how do you solve it?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:32.680,00:02:34.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Backslash.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:34.680,00:02:36.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Backslash, right.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:36.680,00:02:42.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for example, in MATLAB, before I used a lot of, I used ODE45,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:42.680,00:02:46.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,it went through thousands of time steps to solve this equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:46.680,00:02:47.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:47.680,00:02:54.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,But instead, I can just solve the same equation using what?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:54.680,00:03:00.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,u equal to a backslash b, actually minus b.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:00.680,00:03:02.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:02.680,00:03:06.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because I want to solve au plus b equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:06.680,00:03:09.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Here I don't have any right hand side.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:09.680,00:03:11.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:11.680,00:03:14.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,If I close all.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:14.680,00:03:16.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,If I plot u, I get the same thing.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:16.680,00:03:18.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,I get the same thing.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:18.680,00:03:19.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:19.680,00:03:23.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's how we solve elliptic equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:23.680,00:03:24.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Question?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:24.680,00:03:28.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, but only in the case that you're interested in the final steady state.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:28.680,00:03:30.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Only when I'm interested in the final steady state.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:30.680,00:03:31.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Exactly.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:31.680,00:03:32.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Exactly.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:32.680,00:03:35.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's what characterizes elliptic equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:35.680,00:03:39.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'll tell you a little bit, like, what's the difference between hyperbolic and elliptic,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:39.680,00:03:42.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,sorry, parabolic and elliptic equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:42.680,00:03:45.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, so when you don't have any time derivative,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:45.680,00:03:48.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,you can solve the equation by backslash.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:48.680,00:03:54.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if I define some right hand side, let's say I have an f that is equal to 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:54.680,00:03:56.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,n minus 1, 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:56.680,00:04:00.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I have a right hand side f is equal to constant 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:00.680,00:04:07.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,What I'm going to be solving is au plus b plus f equal to 0,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:07.680,00:04:10.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,which makes minus b minus f,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:10.680,00:04:12.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is the same as the time derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:12.680,00:04:14.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I can solve the equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:14.680,00:04:19.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,I get plus b minus f to be the appropriate right hand side.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:19.680,00:04:21.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,If I plot you again,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:21.680,00:04:23.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,here's what I get.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:23.680,00:04:27.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,We get a slight curvature.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:29.680,00:04:30.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Get a slight curvature.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:30.680,00:04:39.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is that what we should have?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:39.680,00:04:41.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think...
Dialogue: 0,00:04:41.680,00:04:44.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Sor the second derivative plus one
Dialogue: 0,00:04:44.680,00:04:49.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,equal to zero which makes the second order derivative to be negative right
Dialogue: 0,00:04:49.540,00:04:56.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,which makes the line go that way all right so that's what we should get and
Dialogue: 0,00:04:56.400,00:05:06.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,if you increase F by a hundred you get something a lot more curvy so that's
Dialogue: 0,00:05:06.480,00:05:13.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,that's solving elliptic equations and the difference between elliptic
Dialogue: 0,00:05:13.560,00:05:23.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,equations and parabolic equations so remember what we had is the domain of
Dialogue: 0,00:05:23.940,00:05:29.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,dependence so I'm not going to be talking about the meaning of elliptic
Dialogue: 0,00:05:29.340,00:05:36.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,and parabolic because it relates to some analytical partial differential equation
Dialogue: 0,00:05:36.900,00:05:42.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,theory but I'm just going to tell you in terms of behavior how do they behave
Dialogue: 0,00:05:42.800,00:05:43.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,differently
Dialogue: 0,00:05:43.560,00:05:51.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,so elliptic equation works in space and time that's the physical interpretation
Dialogue: 0,00:05:51.360,00:05:56.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,of it in mathematics mathematicians may not care about the difference between
Dialogue: 0,00:05:56.800,00:06:01.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,space and time right because for them they are basically independent variables
Dialogue: 0,00:06:01.500,00:06:06.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,of a function but when we talk about difference in different types of
Dialogue: 0,00:06:06.960,00:06:13.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,equations we can think of for parabolic equations there is one special coordinate
Dialogue: 0,00:06:13.560,00:06:18.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,we can just call it time and that special coordinate has such a feature
Dialogue: 0,00:06:18.760,00:06:23.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,that if you introduced a perturbation to the differential equation to the
Dialogue: 0,00:06:23.380,00:06:29.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,solution either to the solution or to the differential equation itself at a
Dialogue: 0,00:06:29.600,00:06:35.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,particular space in time that perturbation is going to change the
Dialogue: 0,00:06:35.880,00:06:43.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,solution not before that particular time but after that particular time right and
Dialogue: 0,00:06:43.560,00:06:48.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,Basically that makes sense if you solve the heat equation for example. If you add
Dialogue: 0,00:06:48.720,00:06:54.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,heat at a particular point in space at a particular point in time, the solution,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:54.360,00:06:58.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,the temperature field is going to be changed not before you add that heat but
Dialogue: 0,00:06:58.560,00:07:04.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,after you add that heat. And because heat, according to heat equation, it diffuses
Dialogue: 0,00:07:04.620,00:07:11.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,instantaneously. There is no speed of diffusion for heat. The solution is going
Dialogue: 0,00:07:11.640,00:07:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,to be changed immediately after the time you add the heat. The change is
Dialogue: 0,00:07:18.000,00:07:25.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,going to be very very small, far away from the heat source, very recent after
Dialogue: 0,00:07:25.840,00:07:31.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,the addition, but it'll be different. So parabolic equation means that there
Dialogue: 0,00:07:31.360,00:07:36.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,exists such a special coordinate, a special independent variable for which
Dialogue: 0,00:07:36.520,00:07:41.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,that it behaves like time. If you put up the equation at a particular point in
Dialogue: 0,00:07:41.620,00:07:48.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,time, the solution later is going to be different. Elliptic equation does not
Dialogue: 0,00:07:48.240,00:07:55.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,have that special coordinate, so that's why we usually call it x. Instead of t we
Dialogue: 0,00:07:55.180,00:08:02.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,call it y, think of just that two spatial dimensions. And, for example, the more
Dialogue: 0,00:08:02.800,00:08:08.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,general case of this is, we also have two spatial dimensions, facelift atizza
Dialogue: 0,00:08:08.740,00:08:11.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,arson. The second load derivative in X and second
Dialogue: 0,00:08:11.580,00:08:11.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,low- issue in two over R. and n один dados. And now it's two morequin dive in f.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:11.620,00:08:17.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,the derivative in y. That equation does not have neither x nor y is a special
Dialogue: 0,00:08:17.920,00:08:25.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,coordinate. If you change, if you put a change in the in the equation, let's say
Dialogue: 0,00:08:25.060,00:08:31.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,plus, if you change the f at a particular x and y, the solution is not only going
Dialogue: 0,00:08:31.960,00:08:35.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,to be different after a particular y, but it's going to be different everywhere.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:35.880,00:08:42.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's going to change globally. So elliptic equations are the ones without that
Dialogue: 0,00:08:42.120,00:09:03.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,special time-like coordinate. Yeah, this is parabolic, this is elliptic. All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:03.400,00:09:05.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you think physically, it's
Dialogue: 0,00:09:05.880,00:09:10.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,pretty easy to distinguish an elliptic equation. It's one basically without time,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:10.440,00:09:14.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,a steady-state type of solution.
