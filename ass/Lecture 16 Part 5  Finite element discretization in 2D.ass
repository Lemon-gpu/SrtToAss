Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:14.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so now I defined my basis functions that way. Let's start to derive the linear form.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:14.240,00:00:29.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to represent my solution u h being a linear combination of i goes from 1 to n, n being the number of interior grid points of u i times phi i.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:30.000,00:00:36.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, phi i are the piecewise linear and continuous functions I was just visualizing.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:38.320,00:00:44.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what we need is the bilinear form on a h and v.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:45.360,00:00:53.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,And here I can substitute v by any of these basis functions v j has to be equal to l of v j.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:54.340,00:00:58.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,If I have this satisfied, then I can make any linear combination.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:58.380,00:00:58.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's say.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:58.840,00:01:06.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Of these equalities and get the same equality for any v in the same linear space.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:07.480,00:01:11.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so for j goes from 1 to n.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:13.140,00:01:25.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the left-hand side, I can use the bilinearity of u and expand this by pulling the summation and all the coefficients out.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:26.860,00:01:28.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's going to be a summation.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:28.840,00:01:38.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,Over i u i times a of phi i and phi j is equal to l of phi j.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:39.720,00:01:40.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:41.460,00:01:51.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,So then our tasks, our task is to evaluate this and call this a i j and evaluate this and call this b j.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:51.800,00:01:58.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then what I get is the matrix a times my solution u u 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:58.040,00:01:58.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then what I get is the matrix a times my solution u u 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:58.840,00:01:59.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then what I get is the matrix a times my solution u u n.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:59.640,00:02:00.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then what I get is the matrix a times my solution u u n.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:00.280,00:02:02.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is going to be equal to the vector b.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:03.880,00:02:09.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,That allows me to solve for the linear combination coefficients u i.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:10.680,00:02:15.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Which turns out to be the height of these basis functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:16.960,00:02:17.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:18.620,00:02:19.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,Questions so far?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:22.000,00:02:22.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:22.840,00:02:27.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now let's figure out how to evaluate these a i j's.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:28.340,00:02:28.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:28.840,00:02:29.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,Phi.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:30.120,00:02:35.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So a i j is equal to a of phi i phi j.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:35.860,00:02:36.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:36.880,00:02:44.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,Which is equal to the integral of the domain of the gradient of phi i dot product with the gradient of phi j.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:49.180,00:02:52.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,Again, this is going to be a very sparse matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:53.400,00:02:56.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because let's just go back into MATLAB.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:57.300,00:02:57.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,And.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:57.680,00:02:57.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:58.840,00:03:00.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Visualize this one.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:00.660,00:03:02.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,And let's hold on.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:03.120,00:03:06.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's make a v also equal to the zeros.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:06.780,00:03:09.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's make a v into an arbitrary other.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:10.600,00:03:12.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's say a hundred is equal to one.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:13.620,00:03:16.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's do another choice of.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:16.780,00:03:18.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,Of this with v.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:21.260,00:03:21.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:24.480,00:03:25.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:25.180,00:03:26.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I get two basis functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:26.780,00:03:28.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,One is the blue one.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:28.500,00:03:29.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,One is the yellow one.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:31.580,00:03:34.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if i and j are equal to one hundred and two hundred.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:34.640,00:03:36.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,What is a i j in that case?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:37.740,00:03:40.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's going to be zero because if we look at the formula for a i j.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:41.300,00:03:46.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,It is the integral integral of the entire domain of the gradient of phi i times the gradient of phi j.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:47.320,00:03:52.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the gradient of phi i and phi j has no overlap in the areas where they are non-zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:53.880,00:03:54.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:54.460,00:03:57.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for example the yellow one is only non-zero in.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:57.880,00:03:59.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,One two three four five elements.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:59.880,00:04:01.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Five of these triangles.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:01.880,00:04:03.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,The blue one is less clear.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:03.880,00:04:05.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Maybe six.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:05.880,00:04:07.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:07.880,00:04:09.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Blue one I think is six.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:09.880,00:04:11.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,But like they are.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:11.880,00:04:17.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Each one is only going to be non-zero in the triangles that shares that particular point.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:17.880,00:04:19.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:19.880,00:04:21.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now it's a little bit more complex than the one dimensional case.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:21.880,00:04:23.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,In one dimensional case.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:23.880,00:04:25.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,And a basic function is only non-zero in two areas.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:25.880,00:04:26.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:26.380,00:04:26.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,So.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:26.880,00:04:28.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's going to be non-zero in two elements.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:28.880,00:04:29.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:29.380,00:04:30.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,Left and right.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:30.380,00:04:36.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,In this case each basis function is going to be non-zero in a small number of elements.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:36.380,00:04:38.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,But that small number is no longer going to be a constant.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:38.880,00:04:40.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,It depends on.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:40.880,00:04:42.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,The yellow one has five.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:42.880,00:04:44.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,The blue one has six.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:44.880,00:04:46.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:46.880,00:04:48.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,So but anyway.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:48.880,00:04:52.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,These are going to be equal to.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:52.880,00:04:54.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Integration.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:54.880,00:04:56.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's going to be.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:56.880,00:05:00.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Split that up into summation of elements.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:00.880,00:05:02.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,So elements.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:02.880,00:05:04.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,So.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:04.880,00:05:06.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's say k.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:06.880,00:05:08.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,In the elements.

Dialogue: 0,00:05:10.880,00:05:12.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,So omega k is the kth triangle.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:12.880,00:05:14.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Gradient phi i.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:14.880,00:05:16.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Gradient phi j dx.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:16.880,00:05:18.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is good because.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:18.880,00:05:20.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Over each element.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:20.880,00:05:22.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Both.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:22.880,00:05:24.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Phi i and phi j are linear.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:24.880,00:05:25.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,So.
