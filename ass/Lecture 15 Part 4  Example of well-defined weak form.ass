Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:07.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,An example of a coercive bilinear form and a non-coercive bilinear form can be looked at,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:08.660,00:00:13.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,can be given by just using the Poisson's equation for different boundary conditions.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:15.040,00:00:22.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,So case one, the Poisson's equation, a of u, u, this is scary.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:22.720,00:00:33.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so a of u, u for Poisson's equation is going to be equal to integration from,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:34.140,00:00:41.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,let's look at the domain from 0 to 1, du, dx, sorry, a of u and v, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:44.300,00:00:48.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right, so coercivity, we only need to look at a of u and u, du, dx, dx.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:48.560,00:00:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is for Poisson's equation with,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:52.720,00:00:59.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,with u0 equal to u1 equal to 0, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:59.960,00:01:07.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is, we have this boundary condition because when we integrate by parts,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:07.980,00:01:14.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,we have removed the boundary terms, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:14.580,00:01:22.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so let's look at the, let's look at a of u and u,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:22.720,00:01:31.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,compared to the norm of u squared in H1 norm.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:32.220,00:01:37.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the norm of u squared in H1 norm is of course equal to integration of u squared
Dialogue: 0,00:01:37.420,00:01:41.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,plus the derivative of u squared dx.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:41.260,00:01:49.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, and so let's see.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:52.720,00:01:59.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we can obviously see the continuity of this because the continuity can be analyzed
Dialogue: 0,00:01:59.960,00:02:00.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,using Cauchy-Schwarz.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:00.960,00:02:05.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you have u and v, you have, so you can make the inequality here.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:05.560,00:02:08.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,But the coercivity is the other way.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:08.220,00:02:15.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,We can't, we can, we can already see that a of u and u is less or equal to the norm of u squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:15.060,00:02:17.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,But coercivity needs the other way, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:17.720,00:02:22.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,We need our a of u and u to be greater or equal to a constant times the norm.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:22.720,00:02:26.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,So here we need to use the Poincare's inequality.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:26.720,00:02:38.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,Poincare's inequality basically says that this term is less than a constant times this term.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:38.720,00:02:48.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, so integration u's, well the Poincare's inequality really says the integration of u minus the u bar
Dialogue: 0,00:02:48.720,00:02:51.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,squared dx is less than a constant.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:51.720,00:02:52.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:52.720,00:02:55.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we can say that the Poincare's inequality is less than a constant, called the Poincare's
Dialogue: 0,00:02:55.720,00:02:56.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,constant.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:56.720,00:03:06.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let me just say as, let me just say is p, it's the Poincare's constant, du dx squared
Dialogue: 0,00:03:06.720,00:03:08.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,dx.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:08.220,00:03:09.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:09.320,00:03:17.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the saving grace here is that we can replace, so here u bar is equal to the average of u
Dialogue: 0,00:03:17.720,00:03:21.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,in the space, in the space.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:21.720,00:03:30.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we can say that we can basically replace this u bar with zero here because u satisfies
Dialogue: 0,00:03:30.960,00:03:33.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,two zero boundary conditions.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:33.220,00:03:34.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:34.220,00:03:45.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we can, we can say that u bar can be replaced by, let's see, u bar is equal to, let's see,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:45.720,00:03:50.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,u bar is equal to, let's see, u bar is equal to, let's see, u bar is equal to, let's see,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:50.720,00:03:51.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,2, 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:51.720,00:03:52.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,This part of the expression is present in the list of these terms that we have learned
Dialogue: 0,00:03:52.720,00:03:54.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,for the Poincare's inequality.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:54.720,00:03:55.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,And actually this is something that I'm record of sometimes, because I've been using a alphabetic
Dialogue: 0,00:03:55.720,00:03:56.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,table, this loop Puerto Iglesias, all of the dy multiplication that we have done,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:56.720,00:03:57.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,procedure.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:57.720,00:03:58.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what does Trainer a, weaken a removed from the judging order here and October
Dialogue: 0,00:03:58.720,00:04:10.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,15th we found that since I think that this two extra words per typist is
Dialogue: 0,00:04:10.720,00:04:11.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,note already.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:11.720,00:04:12.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,Further.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:12.720,00:04:13.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's more, interesting.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:13.720,00:04:14.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,After question number two, I think that penalty number, we implicitly afraid of
Dialogue: 0,00:04:14.720,00:04:15.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,solution of these whose � sebel volte prime be ever given.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:15.720,00:04:16.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:16.720,00:04:17.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, 밑ıl the equütas coupling, we can sum these this, this up.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:17.720,00:04:18.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if we get this inverse, we help this.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:18.720,00:04:19.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now what do we get?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:19.720,00:04:21.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,The x goes from 0 to 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:22.240,00:04:27.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,And for any x, the integral of x prime goes from 0 to x.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:27.720,00:04:33.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we are integrating the derivative in such a triangular shape.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:33.100,00:04:35.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we can rewrite.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:35.240,00:04:46.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,We can pull the integration of x prime out and have the du dx and times this x prime times dx.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:46.780,00:04:49.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we are replacing the integral.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:49.320,00:04:50.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,We're integrating over this first.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:51.480,00:05:01.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the integration over this part is actually integration of this times 1 minus x.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:01.320,00:05:08.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because the length of the integration domain is 1 minus x.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:09.620,00:05:12.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is just a trick of when you have double integral.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:14.700,00:05:16.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,You can exchange this to integral.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:16.780,00:05:21.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,And because this is a function of delta x prime.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:22.780,00:05:27.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you exchange the integrals and you get a lot simpler formula.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:29.220,00:05:39.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this allows us to replace this u bar squared with the norm of the derivatives.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:39.520,00:05:46.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,But through this, we can get the coercivity coefficient being a function of the Poincare constant.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:46.780,00:05:55.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this allows us to bond the integration of u square with the integration of the derivative squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:56.680,00:06:00.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this term can be pulled out as a function of du dx.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:01.100,00:06:04.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that moves to the right-hand side.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:04.540,00:06:15.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,So basically, we have integration of u square being less or equal to a certain constant times the integration of a certain constant.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:15.780,00:06:16.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's say p prime.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:16.780,00:06:21.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have integration of u square times the integration of du dx square.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:22.420,00:06:24.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is this term.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:24.220,00:06:29.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then I still copy the same second order term, second term.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:30.020,00:06:31.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that comes here.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:31.220,00:06:42.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that gives us that the square of the h1 norm of u is less or equal to p prime plus 1 times the bilinear form.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:43.660,00:06:44.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:45.080,00:06:46.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's a sketch of the proof.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:46.960,00:06:48.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,We didn't go all the way through.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:53.220,00:07:04.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,So a counter example of coercivity is when instead of having derisional boundary conditions, we have Newman boundary conditions.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:06.260,00:07:12.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if we have Newman boundary conditions on both sides,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:12.900,00:07:14.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,so du dx,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:14.720,00:07:16.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,equal to 0 at,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:16.960,00:07:18.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,x equal to 0 at 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:20.300,00:07:22.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,we're going to see we don't have coercivity.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:23.220,00:07:29.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because a of u and u is going to be equal to 0, 1, du dx,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:29.460,00:07:31.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,square dx.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:32.100,00:07:38.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the norm of u square is equal to u square plus du dx,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:38.720,00:07:40.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,square dx.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:41.100,00:07:46.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,It turns out we can have constant functions that are constant between 0 and 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:46.780,00:07:47.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:47.280,00:07:49.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,They satisfy the boundary condition.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:49.340,00:07:56.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,But their bilinear form can be arbitrarily small, actually can be 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:56.220,00:08:01.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,While the h1 norm of u is going to be not 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:01.100,00:08:06.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is an example that we don't have coercivity.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:06.580,00:08:10.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the weak form is not well defined.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:10.020,00:08:13.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's not well posed.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:13.140,00:08:20.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,So a of u, v equal to l of v not well posed.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:20.140,00:08:29.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is because if you have 0 Newman boundary conditions at both ends,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:29.140,00:08:34.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,for Poisson's equation, if you put a forcing into the,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:34.140,00:08:39.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,if you put a right hand side whose integral is not equal to 0,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:39.140,00:08:41.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,then there is no solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:41.140,00:08:42.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:42.140,00:08:49.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well, there is no solution because,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:49.140,00:08:57.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,because you can, you can integrate the second order derivative of u over dx.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:57.140,00:09:02.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is just the first order derivative of u at 0 and 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:02.140,00:09:07.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,It has to be 0 if we have Newman, Newman boundary condition at both ends.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:07.140,00:09:09.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,And because of the Poisson's equation,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:09.140,00:09:11.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,this also has to equal to minus,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:11.140,00:09:14.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,integration of the right hand side dx.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:14.140,00:09:22.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,So of course, this can be a contradiction because f can be an arbitrary function whose integral doesn't have to be 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:22.140,00:09:23.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:23.140,00:09:26.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you have a lot of cases where you don't have a solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:26.140,00:09:31.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this can, this is reflected in the fact that the bilinear form is not coercive.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:31.140,00:09:33.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:33.140,00:09:36.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,The derivation is the same.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:36.140,00:09:38.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean, the whole thing is still unretaining.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:38.140,00:09:40.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,What coercivity is there?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:40.140,00:09:46.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,What coercivity actually represents the .
Dialogue: 0,00:09:46.140,00:09:52.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,It means the, so, okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:52.140,00:10:03.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,It means that it's a sufficient condition to guarantee that a is not singular in some sense.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:03.140,00:10:09.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, so let me give an example of a bilinear form in a finite dimensional.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:09.140,00:10:11.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,case.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:11.140,00:10:17.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if u is in x is in Rn and v is in Rn.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:17.140,00:10:23.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, so this, these are also perfectly reasonable spaces, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:23.140,00:10:25.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,These are linear spaces.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:25.140,00:10:31.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,And in this case, this a can be represented as a matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:35.140,00:10:36.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:36.140,00:10:38.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,So a is a n by n.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:39.140,00:10:43.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,So a is a n by n matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:43.140,00:11:02.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,Coercivity, coercivity means that a u transpose, u transpose a v has to be greater or equal to a constant times the norm of u times the norm of v.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:02.140,00:11:05.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:05.140,00:11:27.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you, if you know the singular value decomposition of a matrix, this basically says that if I can represent the matrix as a singular value decomposition, this is going to be.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:27.140,00:11:29.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:29.140,00:11:31.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,So.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:31.140,00:11:33.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is a.

Dialogue: 0,00:11:41.140,00:11:44.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,Both big U and big V.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:44.140,00:11:45.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well, sorry.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:45.140,00:11:49.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,So coercivity means like this has to be the same for the same U, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:49.140,00:11:51.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,Sorry.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:51.140,00:11:54.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,Both big U and big V, they are also normal matrices.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:54.140,00:11:58.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, so U times U and V times V, they are going to be the same.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:58.140,00:12:01.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,They are going to preserve the L2 norm.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:01.140,00:12:08.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, so it basically says that the singular values cannot be zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:08.140,00:12:10.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,The singular values cannot be zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:10.140,00:12:19.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,And wait, actually, that's, that's not exactly, that's not exactly the case.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:19.140,00:12:20.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:20.140,00:12:29.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, so it's only, only if a is a symmetric matrix, we can do this because the singular value decomposition is the same as eigenvalue decompositions.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:29.140,00:12:30.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what we have is U transpose.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:30.140,00:12:32.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what we have is U transpose.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:32.140,00:12:34.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,For only for symmetric matrices.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:34.140,00:12:44.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,And what this says is for symmetric matrices, the coercivity means the eigenvalues has to be all positive.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:44.140,00:12:45.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:45.140,00:12:55.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, so for non-symmetric matrix matrices, positive definities of the matrix, I think it's hard to connect with the singular values.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:55.140,00:12:59.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is a one way for, at least for me to understand.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:59.140,00:13:07.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,What coercivity means in a, basically by thinking in the finite dimensional case, it's just a matrix.
