Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:09.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now I want to spend the last little time discussing what we can do with non-Numan
Dialogue: 0,00:00:09.020,00:00:13.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,boundary conditions, what's called the natural boundary condition. So natural
Dialogue: 0,00:00:13.520,00:00:18.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,boundary condition is quite interesting because it's something unique to finite
Dialogue: 0,00:00:18.760,00:00:23.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,element. We don't have this infinite volume or finite difference. It turns out
Dialogue: 0,00:00:23.960,00:00:32.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,what if I have a boundary condition that is du dx at 0 equal to 0? Okay, I still
Dialogue: 0,00:00:32.320,00:00:38.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,have u1 equal to 0 being Dirichlet boundary condition. So I have
Dialogue: 0,00:00:38.640,00:00:53.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,N on the left and Dirichlet on the right.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:53.960,00:01:03.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that is, I'm looking for solutions like that. On the left has to be flat and on the right it has to be equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:03.960,00:01:11.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm looking for these kind of solutions. So let's use the Poisson's
Dialogue: 0,00:01:11.340,00:01:18.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,equation as an example. So how should I deal with this kind of boundary conditions?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:18.960,00:01:23.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,It turns out I don't need to do anything for this boundary condition.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:23.960,00:01:28.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's why it is called a natural boundary condition.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:28.100,00:01:33.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,What do I mean by I don't need to do anything? So to parameterize a function
Dialogue: 0,00:01:33.960,00:01:45.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,like this, I need to define my x u to be all the functions f within a Sobolev
Dialogue: 0,00:01:45.380,00:01:52.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,space and f1 is equal to 0. So I only need to enforce the right-hand side
Dialogue: 0,00:01:52.640,00:01:53.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,boundary condition.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:53.960,00:02:04.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, and I'm going to define my x v to be the same as x u. So what happens is
Dialogue: 0,00:02:04.780,00:02:13.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,that when I derive the weak form, the weak form is going to be integration of
Dialogue: 0,00:02:13.520,00:02:23.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,a and b. v times the second order derivative of x plus a and b f times v.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:23.960,00:02:24.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,Δ had b times 2 buses because all those Totals are in Koblenz.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:24.660,00:02:31.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,So when Iع perform it with my partииo an the on the first term we no longer
Dialogue: 0,00:02:31.340,00:02:38.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,because because we no longer have you Ovi to be equal to 0 on the left side
Dialogue: 0,00:02:38.240,00:02:44.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,boundary we have to start considering the boundary terms at the left. It's no
Dialogue: 0,00:02:44.700,00:02:51.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,longer going to be the same as what we have before. so when we integrate by
Dialogue: 0,00:02:51.020,00:02:53.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,parts we get V times the
Dialogue: 0,00:02:53.960,00:03:04.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,derivative of u at so so when x equal to 1 we get when when x equal to 1 V is
Dialogue: 0,00:03:04.480,00:03:08.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,equal to 0 so this is gone we only have this equal to 0 we have a minus sign
Dialogue: 0,00:03:08.860,00:03:16.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,here minus the integration of partial V partial X partial u partial X DX plus
Dialogue: 0,00:03:16.820,00:03:29.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,integration of F times V equal to 0 right okay so here this is what becomes
Dialogue: 0,00:03:29.840,00:03:37.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,very interesting this has to be satisfied for any V whose value at the
Dialogue: 0,00:03:37.660,00:03:43.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,left boundary can be anything right and in order for me to satisfy this for any
Dialogue: 0,00:03:43.840,00:03:46.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,V
Dialogue: 0,00:03:46.820,00:04:04.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,this becomes 0 so so so for the solution u to satisfy the weak form for any V
Dialogue: 0,00:04:04.740,00:04:16.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,that doesn't have to be 0 which can be anything at X equal to 0
Dialogue: 0,00:04:16.460,00:04:16.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,right so this becomes 0 so so for the solution u to satisfy the weak form for
Dialogue: 0,00:04:16.800,00:04:25.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,we have to have partial u partial X at 0 to be 0 so the bond the condition of
Dialogue: 0,00:04:25.740,00:04:33.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,the derivative of u at the F-bond is equal to 0 comes naturally from the weak
Dialogue: 0,00:04:33.320,00:04:39.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,form okay so that's why we call it a natural bond the condition it naturally
Dialogue: 0,00:04:39.960,00:04:46.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,falls out of the weak form now perhaps we have a question
Dialogue: 0,00:04:46.640,00:04:46.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,now perhaps we have a question
Dialogue: 0,00:04:46.680,00:04:51.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,What if I want to enforce a Newman boundary condition that is not exactly equal to 0?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:51.420,00:04:52.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,What if I want it to be 1?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:54.380,00:04:56.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,How can I design it?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:56.720,00:04:59.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Does it still come naturally out of the weak form?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:04.780,00:05:10.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,I can still make it come out of the weak form by modifying one term.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:11.360,00:05:15.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,The term I need to modify is this.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:16.680,00:05:31.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what if I set this not to be 0, but if I remove the 0 and add another term, that is v at 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:32.780,00:05:45.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Remember, we just discussed that the linear functional doesn't have to be the integral of a function times v.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:45.060,00:05:46.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,It can also be.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:46.680,00:05:49.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,The value of v at a particular point.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:49.720,00:05:58.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in this case, what if I set the linear functional to be the summation of an integral with a known function and the value of v at a boundary?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:59.040,00:06:02.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,What turns out to be is that we are going to have a v of 0 here.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:03.280,00:06:05.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,And now v can be anything at 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:07.240,00:06:14.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because the weak form has to be satisfied for any v within xv, which can be anything at x equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:14.700,00:06:16.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for this to be equal to 0, we have to do the same thing.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:16.660,00:06:25.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if I do this, the derivative of u at x has to be, in this case, minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:27.560,00:06:35.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,And of course, if I want the derivative to be plus 1, I just set this to be negative v.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:35.340,00:06:36.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I have a negative v.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:36.680,00:06:41.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,If I want the derivative to be 0.5, then it's negative 0.5 of v.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:42.100,00:06:46.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,So by modifying just the weak form a little bit,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:46.380,00:06:51.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,particularly the right-hand side of the weak form, which is the linear functional a little bit,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:51.640,00:06:55.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,we can have the boundary condition naturally satisfied.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:57.180,00:07:00.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Remember, this is very different from the Dirichlet boundary condition.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:00.780,00:07:04.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,The Dirichlet boundary condition, we actually modify the space of xu.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:05.360,00:07:12.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we also reduce the dimension of the space xv to satisfy the boundary condition.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:12.620,00:07:15.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,We actually force the solution u a priori.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:16.380,00:07:20.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we also reduce the dimension of the space xv to satisfy that boundary condition.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:20.380,00:07:24.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any possible solution that is in the space has to satisfy the Dirichlet boundary condition.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:24.380,00:07:26.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,But for the Newman boundary condition, it's natural.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:26.380,00:07:29.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,We only modify the weak form a little bit.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:29.380,00:07:36.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,And it turns out the boundary condition is going to be naturally satisfied once the weak form is satisfied.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:36.380,00:07:41.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,So these are two types of strategies for enforcing boundary conditions in finite element.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:41.380,00:07:44.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes, so I already got the weak form.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:44.380,00:07:45.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,There is no problem.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:46.380,00:07:48.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,No violation to the Poisson.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:48.380,00:07:49.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean, this is assuming.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:50.380,00:07:53.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I can derive the weak form from the Poisson's equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:53.280,00:07:58.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because if any solution satisfies the Poisson's equation, it also satisfies the weak form.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:58.840,00:08:00.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's just the other is not true.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:00.460,00:08:06.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if I have a function that satisfies the weak form, it doesn't have to correspond to any particular Poisson's equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:06.940,00:08:12.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean, if you try to derive it, you get something that is not a function on the right-hand side.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:12.080,00:08:16.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I went through this procedure to derive the weak form.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:16.380,00:08:23.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's just the boundary condition is going to fall out as an additional term on the right-hand side.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:23.380,00:08:26.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,You can still do the same derivation.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:26.380,00:08:28.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,You can still integrate by parts.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:28.380,00:08:34.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we are still going to get the same form.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:34.380,00:08:42.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's just that if we have a non-zero boundary condition, then this boundary term becomes something non-trivial.
