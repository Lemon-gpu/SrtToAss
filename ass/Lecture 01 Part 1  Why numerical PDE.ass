Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:06.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is a very recent example from last year. How many of you have heard about
Dialogue: 0,00:00:06.300,00:00:13.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,the news that human beings have for the first time detected gravitational waves?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:13.760,00:00:20.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,So most of you have. And how many of you knows that numerical solution of partial
Dialogue: 0,00:00:20.820,00:00:28.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,differential equations has contributed greatly to the discovery? Only a few
Dialogue: 0,00:00:28.520,00:00:34.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,people. Let me tell you how this become the case. So if you look at the left-hand
Dialogue: 0,00:00:34.760,00:00:41.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,side of this slide, you're gonna see the kind of signal detected on the two
Dialogue: 0,00:00:41.480,00:00:48.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,observatories across the country. And the puzzle is of course how did the
Dialogue: 0,00:00:48.520,00:00:54.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,physicists know that these kind of signals corresponds to the merger of two
Dialogue: 0,00:00:54.740,00:00:58.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,black holes? Einstein has done a lot of research on this. He has done a lot of research on the
Dialogue: 0,00:00:58.500,00:01:05.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,nonlinear equations. He has derived the equations almost a century ago. And it
Dialogue: 0,00:01:05.580,00:01:11.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,turns out these equations are remarkably difficult to solve analytically, except
Dialogue: 0,00:01:11.580,00:01:17.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,for very restricted, very simplified cases. And it turns out the merger of two
Dialogue: 0,00:01:17.880,00:01:26.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,black holes has to be solved using numerical techniques. So people have to
Dialogue: 0,00:01:26.520,00:01:28.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,put Einstein's field equation, which is a partial differential equation, a nonlinear
Dialogue: 0,00:01:28.500,00:01:33.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,equation, and a partial differential equation. Discretize it using numerical methods, put
Dialogue: 0,00:01:33.880,00:01:40.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,it on the supercomputer, and crank it for days or weeks to get the kind of signal
Dialogue: 0,00:01:40.280,00:01:46.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,that could be emitted by the merger of two black holes. This is amazing to me
Dialogue: 0,00:01:46.780,00:01:53.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,because when people are simulating this, they didn't even know this actually
Dialogue: 0,00:01:53.460,00:01:58.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,existed. That was before the observation. That's
Dialogue: 0,00:01:58.500,00:02:07.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,just in some cases, in some sense, a prediction by purely physical and mathematical and numerical
Dialogue: 0,00:02:07.740,00:02:18.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,deduction. And then last year, people actually detected a wave that corresponds exactly
Dialogue: 0,00:02:18.520,00:02:22.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,to the kind of signal that was predicted by the numerical solution of partial differential
Dialogue: 0,00:02:22.580,00:02:28.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,equations. So this is, to me, is a very motivational example in science.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:28.500,00:02:38.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I just want you to know it's really very useful, mainly for real life science.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:38.760,00:02:42.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,Especially, for the kind of work that we can do today.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:42.480,00:02:46.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's a pretty sophisticated machine, but not always.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:46.940,00:02:52.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we'll come back to the actual problem of waterahlen technology, in the following
Dialogue: 0,00:02:52.880,00:02:53.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,minutes.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:53.880,00:02:54.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the end result is significant.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:54.960,00:02:57.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,The contrast between these sufferings in an earthquake and an spaceship.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:57.680,00:02:58.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is
Dialogue: 0,00:02:58.420,00:03:05.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's also a brand new engine. If you zoom into the engine, the engine itself is a very complex machinery.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:06.800,00:03:07.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,And
Dialogue: 0,00:03:07.900,00:03:12.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,if you even zoom into the first stage of
Dialogue: 0,00:03:12.820,00:03:14.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,the turbine, which is
Dialogue: 0,00:03:16.000,00:03:22.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,directly after the combustion chamber that burns the fuel at very high temperatures, the turbine itself,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:22.960,00:03:27.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,if you look at just the components by itself, it's a very complex machinery by itself.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:28.420,00:03:34.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the question is how do engineers actually design this type of machineries,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:34.780,00:03:42.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,given that they can't really see how it operates because it's inside the turbine, the temperature is so high that
Dialogue: 0,00:03:43.240,00:03:48.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,the flow can basically melt any metal you can conceive of putting into there.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:49.160,00:03:54.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's very difficult to measure anything inside there. Of course, you can't see anything inside there.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:55.180,00:03:57.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,How do people design these kind of things?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:58.420,00:04:04.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,People design these kind of machineries by numerically solving partial differential equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:05.800,00:04:10.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,For example, if you just zoom into the trailing edge of the turbine blade,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:10.900,00:04:14.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is a small part of the whole engine, which is a small part of the whole airplane,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:15.520,00:04:17.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,the simulation looks like that.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:19.240,00:04:21.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is a solution of
Dialogue: 0,00:04:22.440,00:04:28.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,partial differential equation that governs the fluid flow of the hot gas going through the trailing edge of the turbine.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:28.740,00:04:30.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the solution is to measure the temperature of the turbine.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:30.740,00:04:37.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,And through that, people can predict how much heat is going into the turbine from the blade.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:38.280,00:04:41.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,And people can predict what is the maximum temperature on the blade,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:42.480,00:04:50.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,and whether the blade can sustain that kind of temperature under the given stress, which is also simulated numerically.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:50.400,00:04:54.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,And they can predict, is this design good enough?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:54.800,00:04:58.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is this design going to have a sufficiently long life?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:58.420,00:05:00.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,That you can put it in the blade?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:00.420,00:05:06.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or is the local temperature too high so that I have to redesign the blade
Dialogue: 0,00:05:07.280,00:05:14.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,so that the temperature can be lower and can sustain this type of stress and heat for longer time?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:15.540,00:05:19.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this kind of situation also happens a lot, I'm sure, in nuclear engineering.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:21.720,00:05:27.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because the amount of power you can generate in nuclear reactor is really
Dialogue: 0,00:05:28.420,00:05:34.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,determined by how much heat you can carry from the nuclear reaction
Dialogue: 0,00:05:34.580,00:05:38.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,to the outside and do some mechanical work.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:39.240,00:05:40.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,And
Dialogue: 0,00:05:40.600,00:05:45.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,in the engineering field, this is news also from about a year ago.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:46.660,00:05:54.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,President Obama issued the executive order establishing the so-called National Strategic Computing Initiative
Dialogue: 0,00:05:55.900,00:05:58.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,to ensure that the U.S. continues leading
Dialogue: 0,00:05:58.420,00:06:00.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,in the field over the coming decades.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:02.240,00:06:11.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the executive order basically mandates that the U.S. is going to develop larger computers,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:11.640,00:06:13.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,better computing technologies.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:14.320,00:06:21.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the motivation for that is the kind of computational fluid dynamics simulations.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:22.420,00:06:27.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,And they know it has been an important tool in aircraft design since the 1980s.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:28.420,00:06:34.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,But it's also limited by the amount of computing power we have.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:36.420,00:06:43.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,And in order to be able to design better engineering products, we need bigger computers,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:43.660,00:06:48.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,better numerical methods for solving these kind of partial differential equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:50.100,00:06:58.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,So numerically solving partial differential equations has been a huge thing in engineering and is going to be continued to be a huge thing and
Dialogue: 0,00:06:58.420,00:07:00.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,even bigger in engineering in the future.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:02.660,00:07:11.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So these two motivations in science and engineering, they are very advanced things.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:12.440,00:07:18.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,But numerical solution of partial differential equations has also been in our daily life
Dialogue: 0,00:07:19.540,00:07:21.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,for probably as long as we can remember.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:22.820,00:07:25.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,An example is weather forecast.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:26.260,00:07:28.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's weather forecast of
Dialogue: 0,00:07:28.420,00:07:30.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,here in the next few days.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:32.420,00:07:43.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,And many of us didn't really think about it, but the forecast is achieved through numerically solving a set of partial differential equations
Dialogue: 0,00:07:43.420,00:07:47.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,that governs the evolution of the atmosphere.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:49.420,00:07:57.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,And in that numerical solution, the differential equation doesn't know anything about, for example, hurricanes.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:57.420,00:07:58.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,It only knows about the weather.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:58.420,00:08:06.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,It only knows how does the velocity and pressure and humidity change corresponding to the environment around them.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:07.420,00:08:18.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,But once you put these equations into the computer, you will see all kinds of phenomenons like hurricanes and polar vortices and things like that.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:19.420,00:08:22.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is pretty amazing to me.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:22.420,00:08:26.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,The accuracy of numerical simulations has gone up
Dialogue: 0,00:08:26.420,00:08:27.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,over the years.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:28.420,00:08:32.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,And so does the accuracy of weather forecast.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:36.420,00:08:45.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,And by the way, weather forecast is an extremely difficult thing to do, especially well into the future because of something called chaos.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:46.420,00:08:47.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,And
Dialogue: 0,00:08:48.420,00:08:53.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,exponential increase in the accuracy of numerical simulations is going to get you only
Dialogue: 0,00:08:54.420,00:08:56.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,linear increase or incremental increase in how many days.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:57.420,00:08:59.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,You can forecast in the future.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:00.420,00:09:10.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the difference between being able to forecast three days and five days is really all those of magnitude larger computing power you can put into solving these equations.
