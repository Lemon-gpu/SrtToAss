Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:06.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have two cell averages here, we have two cell averages over here, we want
Dialogue: 0,00:00:06.120,00:00:10.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,to reconstruct the solution here and the reconstruction cannot be linear.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:10.500,00:00:20.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,So u of i plus half left is equal to a nonlinear function, has to be
Dialogue: 0,00:00:20.280,00:00:27.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,equal to a nonlinear function of ui and ui minus 1. And u of i plus half right
Dialogue: 0,00:00:27.520,00:00:35.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,has to be a nonlinear function of ui plus 1 and ui plus 2. So the question
Dialogue: 0,00:00:35.760,00:00:43.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,here is how do we achieve that nonlinearity? What kind of nonlinearity
Dialogue: 0,00:00:43.200,00:00:50.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,is it required. And through this process we can also see an aspect of the order
Dialogue: 0,00:00:50.880,00:00:55.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,barrier theorem, why we need a nonlinear scheme.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:55.300,00:00:57.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's start with a nonlinear scheme.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:57.360,00:00:57.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's start with a nonlinear scheme.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:57.500,00:01:09.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,start to look at several cases, several very representative cases of how we want to reconstruct.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:09.820,00:01:22.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is U, this is Ui, this is Ui plus 1, and this is Ui plus 2, and this is a case
Dialogue: 0,00:01:22.720,00:01:27.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,where the solution is very smooth locally.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:27.280,00:01:31.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,The solution increases almost in a linear fashion.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:31.220,00:01:36.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is when you represent the, if you compute the cell averages of a linear function, this
Dialogue: 0,00:01:36.820,00:01:39.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,is what you're going to get.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:39.080,00:01:50.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in this case, this special case 1 is Ui minus Ui minus 1 is equal to Ui plus 1 minus
Dialogue: 0,00:01:50.500,00:01:56.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ui is equal to Ui plus 2 minus Ui plus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:56.060,00:01:57.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is a special case.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:57.280,00:02:02.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,We are considering.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:02.100,00:02:10.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,In this case, second order accuracy means that when we perform a reconstruction of the
Dialogue: 0,00:02:10.560,00:02:20.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,solution, if we reconstruct the solution of a linear equation, to get second order accuracy,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:20.240,00:02:25.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,we need an exact reconstruction.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:25.520,00:02:27.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So first order accuracy means.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:27.120,00:02:32.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,If we reconstruct a constant function, we should get the exact reconstruction.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:32.720,00:02:37.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,And second order accuracy means if we reconstruct a linear function.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:37.680,00:02:41.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Doing Taylor series analysis, linear function has the second order derivative, third order
Dialogue: 0,00:02:41.880,00:02:44.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,derivative, everything else is equal to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:44.860,00:02:54.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if we want a second order accurate reconstruction, we need to have exactly, I want my U at i plus
Dialogue: 0,00:02:54.740,00:02:55.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,half left over.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:55.940,00:02:57.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:57.000,00:02:57.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:57.840,00:03:04.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,Both equal to Ui plus Ui plus 1 over 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:04.360,00:03:06.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's my first case.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:06.560,00:03:10.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:10.520,00:03:19.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,The second case is a completely different scenario.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:19.520,00:03:25.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is a scenario where my Ui is a local maximum.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:27.000,00:03:46.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,When this is a local maximum, can somebody tell me what should the value of Ui plus half
Dialogue: 0,00:03:46.140,00:03:49.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,left?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:49.400,00:03:51.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,What is the constraint on this value?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:51.880,00:03:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Can the value be a half?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:54.000,00:03:55.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:55.000,00:03:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:56.000,00:03:57.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:57.000,00:03:59.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the value of Ui plus half is higher than Ui itself.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:59.500,00:04:08.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,If we want to preserve monotonicity of the total variation.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:08.100,00:04:16.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Remember that monotonicity of total variation is not creating new extremers.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:16.120,00:04:21.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you create a new extremer, if you push the maximum, if you push the local maximum
Dialogue: 0,00:04:21.020,00:04:25.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,of the function above Ui, which is the current local maximum.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:25.440,00:04:26.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:26.440,00:04:29.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now we are increasing the total variation.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:29.440,00:04:30.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:30.440,00:04:31.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:31.440,00:04:34.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,It should be the value of Ui?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:34.440,00:04:35.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:35.440,00:04:40.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in this case, the reconstructed value should actually be the value of Ui.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:40.140,00:04:41.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:41.140,00:04:42.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:42.140,00:04:45.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So here we start to get a sense of why this value is greater than the value of Ui.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:45.040,00:04:46.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:46.040,00:04:47.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:47.040,00:04:49.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you can see that the value of Ui is greater than the value of Ui.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:49.440,00:04:50.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:50.440,00:04:54.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in this case, the value of Ui is greater than the value of Ui.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:54.440,00:04:55.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:55.440,00:04:59.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,So why the reconstruction cannot be linear?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:59.440,00:05:09.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because in the first case, in case one, in order to get this value and in order to represent
Dialogue: 0,00:05:09.840,00:05:17.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,this value, in order to represent Ui, let me use blue to distinguish the two cases,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:17.560,00:05:24.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,in order to get Ui plus R half at left, only as a function of Ui and Ui minus one.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:24.440,00:05:32.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,How can we perform that representation?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:32.440,00:05:37.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Remember here interpolation in the linear function is the same as extrapolation.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:37.440,00:05:38.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:38.440,00:05:52.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we can use Ui minus half of Ui minus Ui minus one.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:52.840,00:05:53.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:53.840,00:05:57.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So here let me rewrite it a little bit.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:57.840,00:06:01.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if I divide this by delta x, that's the slope.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:01.840,00:06:08.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if I multiply that by delta x over two, it is saying that I am computing the slope
Dialogue: 0,00:06:08.840,00:06:11.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,using Ui and Ui minus one here.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:11.840,00:06:18.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I'm applying the same slope over this range, which is delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:18.840,00:06:21.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think it's plus.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:21.840,00:06:22.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Sorry.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:22.840,00:06:26.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:26.840,00:06:30.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the slope.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:30.840,00:06:35.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,And delta x over two is this range.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:35.840,00:06:40.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the width here is delta x over two.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:40.840,00:06:49.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the slope times the x distance, which gets me this.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:49.840,00:06:50.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if I add that to Ui, that's exactly this.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:50.840,00:06:54.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Add that to Ui, that's exactly the value at the interface.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:54.840,00:06:58.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Does it make sense?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:58.840,00:07:05.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So here we are constructing, reconstructing a solution using Ui minus one.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:05.840,00:07:11.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,If Ui minus one increases or decreases, the value here is going to change.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:11.840,00:07:18.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,While in the other case, when the function is not smooth, when the function achieves a local extrema,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:18.840,00:07:23.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,the reconstructed value should not depend on Ui plus one.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:23.840,00:07:28.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes, we are trying to reconstruct the value of U at the interfaces and left and right
Dialogue: 0,00:07:28.840,00:07:35.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,interfaces, so that we can apply the Godanoff scheme to compute the flux at the interface.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:35.840,00:07:42.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So once we can have U left and U right at the interface, applying what we studied in
Dialogue: 0,00:07:42.840,00:07:46.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,the last lecture is going to give us a numerical flux.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:46.840,00:07:50.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what we have is the following.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:50.840,00:08:00.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,In the first case, when the solution is locally smooth, we have Ui plus an influence from the next cell.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:00.840,00:08:07.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,In the other case, when the solution is not smooth, we have just the Ui without influence from the last cell.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:07.840,00:08:15.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we can write that, we can write the second case as plus the same slope.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:16.840,00:08:19.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is, all right, exactly what I can write.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:19.840,00:08:27.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Voltage, delta x times 0, right, and this is like times 1, right.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:27.840,00:08:35.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this 1 or 0 is like turning on and off a slope indicator.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:41.840,00:08:45.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's something we call a limiter, right.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:45.840,00:09:05.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,0 or 1, right? And this phi is equal to 1 for smooth solution and 0 for local
Dialogue: 0,00:09:05.360,00:09:18.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,extremer. So how do we construct this phi? So phi is going to be a sensor of whether
Dialogue: 0,00:09:18.500,00:09:31.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,the solution is locally smooth or not. So phi depends on what? The best way to sense
Dialogue: 0,00:09:31.340,00:09:34.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,whether this is a local extremer or locally smooth.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:35.360,00:09:44.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is the ratio between this and this. If the ratio, in this case, the ratio is equal to
Dialogue: 0,00:09:44.320,00:09:52.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,1. When the ratio is equal to 1, we know it's locally a very linear function. In the other
Dialogue: 0,00:09:52.500,00:10:03.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,case, the ratio is what? It's negative, right? So again, depends on the ratio, let me call
Dialogue: 0,00:10:03.760,00:10:04.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,R.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:04.240,00:10:18.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,R being Ui plus 1 minus Ui divided by Ui minus Ui minus 1. So again, this is equal to 1 if
Dialogue: 0,00:10:18.900,00:10:26.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,R is equal to 1. And for local extremers, either minimal or maximum, R is going to be
Dialogue: 0,00:10:26.520,00:10:34.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,less than 0. Okay. So the flux limiter.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:34.240,00:10:42.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,The flux limiter is this phi of R. And let's figure out what are the conditions that this
Dialogue: 0,00:10:42.240,00:10:50.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,phi of R has to satisfy in order for us to have a second order monotonic scheme. Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:50.440,00:10:52.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,Which one should be Ui minus 1 here?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:52.420,00:10:56.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,The first term before that.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:56.520,00:10:57.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,Here?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:57.520,00:10:58.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:58.520,00:11:02.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Here should be Ui because this value is Ui, right? Let me use this.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:02.240,00:11:03.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:03.240,00:11:04.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:04.240,00:11:11.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the black color here. This value is Ui, right? And the distance between Ui
Dialogue: 0,00:11:11.740,00:11:23.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,and this appropriate reconstruction is delta x over 2 times the slope. Right? So this value
Dialogue: 0,00:11:23.360,00:11:31.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,is Ui plus the slope times delta x over 2. Right? Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:31.240,00:11:33.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for this V?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:33.240,00:11:34.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:34.240,00:11:40.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for this V function, like it's not all inclusive. Like should it just be R greater
Dialogue: 0,00:11:40.040,00:11:43.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,than 0 for smooth solution?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:43.800,00:11:51.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have a proposal that should phi of R be greater than 0 for smooth solutions?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:51.120,00:11:58.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or sorry, phi of R equal to 1 for all R greater than 0? Is that what you are proposing?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:58.240,00:11:59.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:59.240,00:12:02.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay. So we have a proposal that phi looks like that.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:02.240,00:12:03.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:03.240,00:12:14.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have a proposal that phi has a function of R. So this is 0, this is 1. We have a proposal
Dialogue: 0,00:12:14.560,00:12:19.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,that is 0 here and 1 here.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:19.560,00:12:29.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay. We'll take a look at if the proposal works. All right? Okay. So let's figure out
Dialogue: 0,00:12:29.000,00:12:30.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,the appropriate...
Dialogue: 0,00:12:30.680,00:12:31.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's first figure out if this part of the proposal is equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:31.740,00:12:32.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:32.740,00:12:33.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have the part of the proposal works. Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:12:33.980,00:12:41.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,In the green figure, the cell to the left is it equal to Ui plus 1 as well?
Dialogue: 0,00:12:41.980,00:12:46.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, sorry. The left should be Ui minus 1. Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:46.120,00:12:47.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So they don't have to be...
Dialogue: 0,00:12:47.640,00:12:56.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,They don't have to be equal. Yeah. They only need to be both smaller than Ui. Okay. So
Dialogue: 0,00:12:56.400,00:13:00.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,let's first figure out the left side of this proposal works. The proposal is phi should
Dialogue: 0,00:13:00.740,00:13:01.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,be just equal to 0 when I have this part of the data.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:01.740,00:13:02.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:02.740,00:13:04.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,whenever r is less than zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:05.540,00:13:10.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,Does that give us the desired solution
Dialogue: 0,00:13:10.520,00:13:13.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,whenever we have a local extrema?
Dialogue: 0,00:13:15.540,00:13:16.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:13:17.260,00:13:18.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,Whenever we have a local extrema,
Dialogue: 0,00:13:19.140,00:13:22.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,we want a piecewise constant reconstruction
Dialogue: 0,00:13:22.480,00:13:28.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,because any slope is going to give us new extremas.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:28.880,00:13:30.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any non-zero slope is going to make
Dialogue: 0,00:13:30.940,00:13:33.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,the reconstructed solution go higher or lower
Dialogue: 0,00:13:33.920,00:13:35.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,than the existing extrema.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:36.320,00:13:39.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this part of the proposal is correct.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:40.500,00:13:43.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So phi of r should be exactly equal to zero
Dialogue: 0,00:13:43.040,00:13:44.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,whenever r is less than zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:45.640,00:13:47.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, let's then figure out
Dialogue: 0,00:13:47.620,00:13:50.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,if the positive part of this proposal works.
