Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:07.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the GST scheme is a scheme that chooses in between these two...
Dialogue: 0,00:00:10.100,00:00:18.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we know that adding a dissipative flux proportional to delta x cubed times the third-order derivative of u
Dialogue: 0,00:00:18.840,00:00:23.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,is appropriate for smooth regions of the solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:23.100,00:00:30.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,And adding what we added before, a dissipation proportional to the second-order derivative,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:30.680,00:00:36.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,a much stronger dissipation because it's proportional to delta x instead of the much smaller delta x cubed,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:37.480,00:00:41.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,is appropriate around shock waves and the local extremis.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:43.060,00:00:48.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the GST scheme is simply a scheme that chooses in between them
Dialogue: 0,00:00:48.420,00:00:53.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,according to the same limiter we have been using to reconstruct the solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:53.100,00:01:07.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the first step is to construct a limiter phi that is equal to 0 or 1
Dialogue: 0,00:01:07.820,00:01:17.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,if 0 is non-smooth and 1 is smooth, and they can also go in between.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:17.500,00:01:21.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we can use the same limiter we used in our scalar conservation law.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:21.520,00:01:22.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,And second step...
Dialogue: 0,00:01:23.100,00:01:30.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,is to construct a second-order derivative...
Dialogue: 0,00:01:31.280,00:01:37.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,so second-order dissipation flux,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:38.180,00:01:46.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is proportional to the first-order derivative times the maximum value of the characteristic speed.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:48.020,00:01:53.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,And third step is to construct a numerical dissipation proportional...
Dialogue: 0,00:01:53.100,00:01:59.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,to the third-order derivative that is going to give us a fourth-order dissipation.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:59.020,00:02:05.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then combine them using the value of phi.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:05.020,00:02:12.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,In such a way that if phi is equal to 1, then we are purely using the third-order derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:12.020,00:02:17.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if phi is equal to 0, we are also going to be using the first-order derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:17.020,00:02:22.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright, so for example, we can...
Dialogue: 0,00:02:23.100,00:02:26.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,we can multiply...
Dialogue: 0,00:02:27.020,00:02:30.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,we can have this value, the third-order derivative...
Dialogue: 0,00:02:30.020,00:02:38.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,to be also always times 1, and the second-order derivative to be times 1 minus phi.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:38.020,00:02:43.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that gives us the appropriate behavior of...
Dialogue: 0,00:02:43.020,00:02:46.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,when phi is equal to 0, we turn on the stronger dissipation.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:46.020,00:02:51.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,And when phi is equal to 1, we turn off that stronger dissipation.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:51.020,00:02:52.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's...
Dialogue: 0,00:02:52.020,00:02:53.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,that's what...
Dialogue: 0,00:02:53.020,00:02:57.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,that's how the GST scheme deals with system of conservation laws.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:57.940,00:03:03.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Achieving second-order accuracy, but still being non-oscillatory around shock waves.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:03.940,00:03:08.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,It computes the limit of the same as what we compute before.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:08.940,00:03:16.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Based on local extremis and the ratio between slopes between different solutions.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:16.940,00:03:20.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,And construct a second-order and fourth-order dissipation.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:20.940,00:03:22.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,And perform linear conservation.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:23.020,00:03:25.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then we can use the combination of them,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:25.940,00:03:27.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,trimming the second-order on and off,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:27.940,00:03:29.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,according to the value of the limit.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:29.940,00:03:37.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the most advanced material we are going to go into in finite volume schemes.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:37.940,00:03:39.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,So with this...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:39.940,00:03:43.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,this also applies for...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:43.940,00:03:46.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,this also applies for multiple dimensions.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:46.940,00:03:49.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,The only difference in multiple dimensions is that...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:49.940,00:03:51.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,the gradient reconstruction.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:51.940,00:03:58.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So here, we are constructing the gradient by just taking the difference between two adjacent cells.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:58.860,00:04:04.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,In multiple dimensions, you need to take more than two cells to reconstruct a gradient.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:04.860,00:04:13.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Usually you take multiple cells around you and perform a least squares type of estimate for the gradient value.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:13.860,00:04:17.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because in 2D, for example, the gradient gives you two values, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:17.860,00:04:19.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in x and in y.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:19.940,00:04:20.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,But like the number of...
Dialogue: 0,00:04:20.860,00:04:26.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,the number of surrounding cells may be more than two.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:26.860,00:04:27.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So...
Dialogue: 0,00:04:27.860,00:04:34.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,so you have more equations to satisfy than unknowns when you are trying to calculate the gradient.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:34.860,00:04:39.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you have exactly two adjacent cells, like in a...
Dialogue: 0,00:04:39.860,00:04:44.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,then you can solve two equations for two unknowns, being the gradient.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:44.860,00:04:48.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you have many, many cells around you, you have an over-determined system,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:48.860,00:04:49.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and you use these squares...
Dialogue: 0,00:04:49.860,00:04:50.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,to get the gradient.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:50.860,00:04:56.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,But all the other stuff are the same.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:56.860,00:04:57.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:57.860,00:04:59.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,In multiple dimensions.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:59.860,00:05:00.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:00.860,00:05:10.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm not very clear how to use the signature to decide how to do the third-order dissipation.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:10.860,00:05:12.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, that's a...
Dialogue: 0,00:05:12.860,00:05:13.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,that's a good question.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:13.860,00:05:16.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,The third-order dissipation can be always wrong.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:16.860,00:05:17.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's...
Dialogue: 0,00:05:17.860,00:05:18.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,that's something...
Dialogue: 0,00:05:18.860,00:05:19.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,that's the simplest way to determine...

Dialogue: 0,00:05:21.860,00:05:22.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:22.860,00:05:23.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's always wrong.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:23.860,00:05:26.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because if we don't have a shock wave, it's...
Dialogue: 0,00:05:26.860,00:05:32.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,it can be there, providing stability while giving us at least a second-order accuracy.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:32.860,00:05:34.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,When shock wave is...
Dialogue: 0,00:05:34.860,00:05:42.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,when you're around a shock wave, it's also okay to have this term in,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:42.860,00:05:47.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,because the second-order proportional to delta x term is gonna be over-realmedialized.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:47.860,00:05:48.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:48.860,00:05:54.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,overwhelmingly strong so you don't have to you don't have to diminish the third
