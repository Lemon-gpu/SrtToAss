Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:06.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so now we have the setting. So we have a perfectly well-defined weak form.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:06.040,00:00:13.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,We have the bilinear form and the linear functional to be both continuous, and also the bilinear form is coercive.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:14.080,00:00:26.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now we can look at area estimation of how much does restricting the weak form to a finite dimensional space is going to cause an error in the solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:26.560,00:00:36.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,And there are two types of area estimates, a priori and a posteriori area estimates.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:36.520,00:00:46.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,They are different in the sense that for a posteriori area estimate, so we always have a v and a vh.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:48.320,00:00:52.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's say u and uh, sorry.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:52.160,00:00:55.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,So u satisfies...
Dialogue: 0,00:00:56.560,00:01:14.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,The weak form u and v equal to L of v for all v in h1 or whatever infinite dimensional space, okay?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:14.900,00:01:17.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,And uh...
Dialogue: 0,00:01:19.900,00:01:25.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,Before we say like uh can be represented as a linear combination of a finite dimensional space,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:26.560,00:01:28.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,a finite number of bases, that's one thing.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:28.900,00:01:44.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,But another important thing is that u is only going to satisfy the weak form for a less, a subset of v's for all the vh in xh.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:44.900,00:01:47.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,Where xh is a subset of the x.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:49.900,00:01:54.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,x is infinite dimensional, it's all the possible h1s and xh.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:54.900,00:01:55.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,For example, in the periodic table, the x is a subset of the x.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:56.560,00:02:07.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the piecewise linear and continuous representation xh is this piecewise, is all the collection of all these piecewise linear functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:07.900,00:02:09.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:09.900,00:02:13.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,So where xh is a subset of x.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:13.900,00:02:19.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,For example, x is h1.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:19.900,00:02:23.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,xh is the collection of piecewise...
Dialogue: 0,00:02:26.560,00:02:30.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,linear functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:30.560,00:02:32.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:32.560,00:02:36.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, so uh is...
Dialogue: 0,00:02:36.560,00:02:38.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's also the set of piecewise...
Dialogue: 0,00:02:38.560,00:02:41.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,It also belongs to the set of piecewise linear functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:41.560,00:02:45.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,But also, it satisfies exactly the same weak form.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:45.560,00:02:48.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,But only for a subset of x's.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:48.560,00:02:54.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,For vh's only in these subset of functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:54.560,00:02:55.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think...
Dialogue: 0,00:02:56.560,00:02:58.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Pardon?

Dialogue: 0,00:03:03.560,00:03:04.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Continuous...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:04.560,00:03:05.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:05.560,00:03:08.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:08.560,00:03:11.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:11.560,00:03:16.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's start to look at how do we bound the error.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:16.560,00:03:19.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So there are two types of error estimates.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:19.560,00:03:22.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So one type is a...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:22.560,00:03:24.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,priority error estimate.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:24.560,00:03:25.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is to...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:25.560,00:03:32.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is to estimate the difference between u and uh.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:32.560,00:03:39.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,In a certain norm, usually in the norm of the function space x.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:39.560,00:03:43.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Estimated...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:43.560,00:03:47.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,In terms of...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:47.560,00:03:54.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,The properties of a, the properties of l, and the solution u.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:54.560,00:03:55.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:55.560,00:03:59.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So because it's called a priority because we don't know u.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:59.560,00:04:01.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,We don't know what u is.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:01.560,00:04:05.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the error estimate...
Dialogue: 0,00:04:05.560,00:04:07.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is in some sense not computable.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:07.560,00:04:09.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,We can estimate it but like uh...
Dialogue: 0,00:04:09.560,00:04:12.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,You can't really compute what the error estimate is.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:12.560,00:04:15.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because it involves this u.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:15.560,00:04:18.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Which is the exact solution of the weak form.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:18.560,00:04:21.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,A posteriori...
Dialogue: 0,00:04:21.560,00:04:22.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,A posteriori...
Dialogue: 0,00:04:22.560,00:04:26.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is better because...
Dialogue: 0,00:04:26.560,00:04:31.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,It estimates this as...
Dialogue: 0,00:04:31.560,00:04:35.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,In terms of a, l, and uh.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:35.560,00:04:39.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,And because uh is something we can compute.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:39.560,00:04:44.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Usually a posteriori error estimate is computable.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:44.560,00:04:46.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:46.560,00:04:50.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So all the error estimates we did before.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:50.560,00:04:51.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,For example, infinite difference.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:51.560,00:04:58.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Which type does it belong to?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:58.560,00:05:00.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's say we did Taylor series analysis.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:00.560,00:05:06.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,We figured out the error in our finite difference approximation is...
Dialogue: 0,00:05:06.560,00:05:12.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Something times delta x to the cube times the fourth order derivative of u.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:12.560,00:05:13.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:13.560,00:05:17.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,What type of error estimate is that?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:17.560,00:05:19.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:19.560,00:05:20.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,A priori.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:20.560,00:05:21.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,A priori.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:21.560,00:05:22.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:22.560,00:05:23.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Why is that?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:23.560,00:05:24.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because...
Dialogue: 0,00:05:24.560,00:05:25.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:25.560,00:05:27.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because in Taylor series analysis we're saying...
Dialogue: 0,00:05:27.560,00:05:28.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:28.560,00:05:29.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the error is...
Dialogue: 0,00:05:29.560,00:05:34.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,A fourth order derivative of u times delta x to the cube times something.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:34.560,00:05:35.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:35.560,00:05:36.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Like 1 over whatever.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:36.560,00:05:37.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,12.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:37.560,00:05:39.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's say if the error term is like this.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:39.560,00:05:42.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Plus o delta x to the fourth.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:42.560,00:05:44.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then it's a priori.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:44.560,00:05:45.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:45.560,00:05:46.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So...
Dialogue: 0,00:05:46.560,00:05:47.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So...
Dialogue: 0,00:05:47.560,00:05:48.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So...
Dialogue: 0,00:05:48.560,00:05:49.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So...
Dialogue: 0,00:05:49.560,00:05:50.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:50.560,00:05:51.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So...
Dialogue: 0,00:05:51.560,00:05:52.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because of what?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:52.560,00:05:58.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because we actually involve the real solution u in the error estimate.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:58.560,00:06:05.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,A posteriori is a lot more difficult to derive but it's a lot more useful also because we
Dialogue: 0,00:06:05.560,00:06:09.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,should be able to compute the error estimate not from the u but from the...
Dialogue: 0,00:06:09.560,00:06:13.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,The actual discrete solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:13.560,00:06:15.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:15.560,00:06:17.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in this lecture we will start with the easier priority.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:17.560,00:06:18.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:18.560,00:06:25.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,a priority area estimate and if we have time we'll go into a posteriori.
