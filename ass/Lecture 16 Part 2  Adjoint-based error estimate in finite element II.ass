Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:12.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,So there is a potential pitfall here. A potential pitfall here is to approximate this solution v using exactly the same numerical method as what I solved for u h.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:12.440,00:00:35.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,That sometimes doesn't work. Because the pitfall here is that if I solve for a, so let me see, I have a L o of u h minus u, I have already represented as a of u h, u hat, which is the adjoint solution minus L of u hat.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:35.100,00:00:42.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if I approximate this by a of u h.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:42.440,00:00:54.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,L of u h and u hat of h minus L of u hat of h, where u hat of h is solved using exactly the same method as I solved for this u h.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:56.200,00:01:02.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,For example, if I have Poisson's equation, remember our a is symmetric, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:03.120,00:01:05.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,So a of u and v is equal to a of v and u.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:06.040,00:01:08.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,If a is symmetric, what is its adjoint operator?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:11.280,00:01:12.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's itself, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:12.440,00:01:15.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,Symmetric is also called self-adjoint.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:16.360,00:01:24.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, and then I can basically replace the right-hand side and solve using exactly the same numerical method.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:24.740,00:01:28.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,But what is the problem if I do that for approximating this u hat?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:33.600,00:01:35.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes, this would be zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:35.340,00:01:36.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Exactly.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:37.120,00:01:42.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if u hat of h belongs to this...
Dialogue: 0,00:01:42.440,00:01:46.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,This finite dimensional space, xh of v.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:49.140,00:01:57.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then, by definition of the finite element solution, so remember the finite element solution, u h,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:57.960,00:02:07.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's that particular u h in the finite dimensional space that makes the residual equal to zero for any v in this space.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:08.440,00:02:10.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,My approximate residual is going to be zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:10.940,00:02:11.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:11.080,00:02:20.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I cannot use the same numerical method or the adjoint version of the same numerical method.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:20.480,00:02:26.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for that particular u hat.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:27.600,00:02:33.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,The normal practice is to have a richer basis, is to have one...
Dialogue: 0,00:02:33.400,00:02:40.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,For example, if I solve u using piecewise linear basis function, I can solve for u hat using piecewise.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:40.900,00:02:41.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:41.000,00:02:41.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I can solve u using piecewise linear basis function.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:41.040,00:02:50.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that will give me a higher order solution for this u hat and give me a proper area estimate, a posteriori area estimate.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:51.060,00:02:54.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the posteriori area estimate is not going to be free.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:54.280,00:02:56.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,You need to spend additional effort to get that.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:57.700,00:02:58.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:59.520,00:03:07.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So normally, u hat is approximated...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:07.680,00:03:07.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,Approximated...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:07.980,00:03:10.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,Approximated...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:10.820,00:03:17.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,with higher order solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:19.240,00:03:23.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or you can just refine the grid by one more factor
Dialogue: 0,00:03:23.380,00:03:26.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and solve for u hat h.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:28.140,00:03:28.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:32.040,00:03:35.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so this finishes our discussion on error estimation.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:37.000,00:03:38.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the remainder of this lecture
Dialogue: 0,00:03:38.620,00:03:40.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,will go into more than one dimension,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:41.040,00:03:42.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,go to two-dimensional finite elements
Dialogue: 0,00:03:42.840,00:03:45.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,to see how do we apply what we have learned
Dialogue: 0,00:03:45.120,00:03:46.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,into higher dimensions,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:47.200,00:03:49.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,which can deal with more complex geometry.
