Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:09.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have the parabolic equation which is partial u partial t is equal to kappa
Dialogue: 0,00:00:09.720,00:00:15.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,of partial square u partial x squared. We are going to analyze this equation
Dialogue: 0,00:00:15.440,00:00:23.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,analytically using what's called Fourier analysis. Fourier analysis is a very
Dialogue: 0,00:00:23.220,00:00:27.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,powerful tool in studying differential equations especially when you have
Dialogue: 0,00:00:27.840,00:00:34.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,periodic boundary condition and when you have non periodic boundary condition the
Dialogue: 0,00:00:34.020,00:00:40.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,qualitative result of what you get in Fourier analysis is very likely to
Dialogue: 0,00:00:40.460,00:00:48.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,translate into the non periodic boundary condition. So the Fourier analysis is
Dialogue: 0,00:00:48.220,00:00:54.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,expanding the u which is a function of x so u is the solution to the partial
Dialogue: 0,00:00:54.960,00:00:57.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,differential equation. Kappa is a constant
Dialogue: 0,00:00:57.820,00:01:11.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we are thinking of a spatial domain of 0 and 2 pi. Okay so if we have such a
Dialogue: 0,00:01:11.380,00:01:19.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,domain and if the u is periodic which means it ends exactly where it begins
Dialogue: 0,00:01:19.920,00:01:27.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,then I can expand ux as a summation of u hat of k
Dialogue: 0,00:01:27.820,00:01:39.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,times a sinusoidal wave which I can write as exponential of ikx and this case
Dialogue: 0,00:01:39.080,00:01:44.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,was summed over from minus infinity to infinity.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:44.140,00:01:55.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,mhm k is an integer exactly k th�� summed over r possible
Dialogue: 0,00:01:55.920,00:01:56.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,integers.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:56.540,00:01:56.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,And e to the iала is less than initial iba. Okay ut drip is less than initialorship.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:56.700,00:01:57.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,From there, misma is holds for e into pol.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:57.280,00:01:57.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,You are supposed to just solve this.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:57.780,00:02:00.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,What does it look like?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:00.380,00:02:05.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,What does e to the i k x look like?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:05.200,00:02:12.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,E to the i k x looks like a cosine of k x plus an imaginary part of sine k x.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:12.220,00:02:20.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so this u hat of k is a complex number that has imaginary and real parts.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:20.780,00:02:29.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if the u hat of k is exactly the conjugate of u hat of minus k, then the imaginary part
Dialogue: 0,00:02:29.900,00:02:36.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,cancels and you have perfect sines and cosines added up together to form a solution u as
Dialogue: 0,00:02:36.840,00:02:42.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,a function of x.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:42.020,00:02:49.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,The reason we introduce Fourier series, one is because any periodic function can be written
Dialogue: 0,00:02:49.600,00:02:50.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,in such a way.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:50.600,00:02:54.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:54.780,00:03:02.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And two is that when we're looking at partial differential equations, we have spatial derivatives.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:02.760,00:03:09.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,And spatial derivatives work very, very nicely with Fourier series.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:09.620,00:03:17.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for example, when we look at this case, what is the first order derivative of this

Dialogue: 0,00:03:19.940,00:03:20.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:20.580,00:03:30.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,When we take the first order derivatives, of course, the derivative commutes with this
Dialogue: 0,00:03:30.140,00:03:32.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,summation.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:32.220,00:03:34.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,And u hat of k is just a number.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:34.100,00:03:35.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,It doesn't depend on x.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:35.960,00:03:39.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,So u hat of k is also here.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:39.020,00:03:44.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we only have the derivative of e to the i k x dx.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:44.760,00:03:45.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:45.960,00:03:46.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:46.960,00:03:47.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:47.960,00:03:48.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:48.960,00:03:49.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:49.960,00:03:50.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:50.960,00:03:51.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:51.960,00:04:01.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you take that derivative, it becomes i k times e to the i k x.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:01.600,00:04:12.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So taking derivative to a Fourier series is like multiplying i k to each of the u hat
Dialogue: 0,00:04:12.040,00:04:16.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,k's in the expansion using Fourier series.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:16.220,00:04:17.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:17.320,00:04:18.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:18.320,00:04:19.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:19.320,00:04:20.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this gives us our sponsors, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:20.320,00:04:21.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's the original n i?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:21.320,00:04:22.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, there is no同 advertial.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:22.320,00:04:23.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,There is no half- intentar introversion.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:23.320,00:04:24.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,But I now invite you to remember what I said in the earlier part, basically manipulating

Dialogue: 0,00:04:42.320,00:04:43.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So say tllo sisters.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:43.320,00:04:44.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Tell me, how do you calculate the imaginary verb on e?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:44.320,00:04:45.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well, can you gist this is to say級 n?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:45.320,00:04:47.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you can get the h with the t part, and i had u, and we get the k hat, we朔
Dialogue: 0,00:04:47.320,00:04:48.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,tell it to ją with u k hat of i, k-je хоть, and things pure dbut.

Dialogue: 0,00:05:06.860,00:05:09.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,And what is I k square?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:09.460,00:05:14.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,I k square is minus k square because I square is minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:14.660,00:05:18.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,Minus k square, u hat of k, u to the I k x.

Dialogue: 0,00:05:30.240,00:05:30.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:31.840,00:05:32.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So good.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:33.760,00:05:38.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, this is only looking at a function of only space.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:39.080,00:05:42.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,When we are talking about the solution to this partial differential equation,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:42.680,00:05:44.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,u is a function of not only x,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:44.660,00:05:45.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,but also what?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:47.520,00:05:48.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,But also t.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:48.900,00:05:49.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:49.660,00:05:53.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,And when u is a function of x and t,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:53.540,00:05:54.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,this is even nicer.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:55.780,00:05:59.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you take the derivative of x and t,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:59.920,00:06:01.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,oh, let's not take the derivative yet.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:01.900,00:06:06.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's look at if I expand a function of u and t into Fourier series,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:07.140,00:06:08.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,only in x,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:09.380,00:06:10.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,what do I get?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:10.200,00:06:14.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,What becomes different?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:14.660,00:06:15.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,In the expansion.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:15.500,00:06:15.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,In the expansion.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:22.980,00:06:26.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,u hat becomes a function of time, exactly.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:28.060,00:06:29.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is like expanding,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:30.200,00:06:33.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,this is like looking at a function u of x and t
Dialogue: 0,00:06:33.060,00:06:37.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,as functions of x at different t.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:38.320,00:06:38.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:38.720,00:06:42.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,For each t, I look at u x of t as a function of x.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:42.600,00:06:43.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I expand.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:44.660,00:06:47.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,That function of x using Fourier series.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:47.160,00:06:52.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,As a result, the u hat of k is going to be different for every slice of t.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:52.580,00:06:56.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,That means u hat is going to be a function of t.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:56.220,00:07:07.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is a separation of variable because now the second derivative of x becomes a summation.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:07.660,00:07:11.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,Still, k goes from minus infinity to t infinity.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:11.460,00:07:14.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,Minus k squared is still the same.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:14.660,00:07:18.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,u hat of k as a function of t e to the ikx.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:20.580,00:07:26.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,I can do this because u hat of k is a function of t but not x.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:27.420,00:07:32.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So all the spatial derivatives goes right through u hat of t and into the exponentials.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:36.060,00:07:40.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this formula is great, especially when combined with,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:40.940,00:07:43.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,when substituted into the differential equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:43.260,00:07:44.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's do that.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:44.660,00:07:45.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oops.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:45.660,00:07:55.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's substitute the Fourier series into this differential equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:55.980,00:08:01.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,Kappa is still here.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:01.580,00:08:05.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,K goes from minus infinity to infinity.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:05.780,00:08:10.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Minus k squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:10.940,00:08:13.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,u hat of k e to the ikx.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:13.580,00:08:14.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's the differential equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:14.580,00:08:15.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this looks normal.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:15.580,00:08:26.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,But we should also realize that du dt can also be expanded using Fourier series.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:26.580,00:08:27.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's write it over here.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:27.580,00:08:36.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,That is a summation of k goes to minus infinity to infinity of, now, when you're taking the
Dialogue: 0,00:08:36.820,00:08:41.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Fourier series, a time derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:41.200,00:08:43.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,The e to the ikx is not a function of time.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:43.580,00:08:44.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,The only function of time is the u hats.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:44.580,00:08:45.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have the time derivative of the u hat times e to the ikx.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:45.580,00:08:50.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,When you have two sides of an equality, right, two sides of equality, both represented using
Dialogue: 0,00:08:50.580,00:08:55.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,Fourier series, you know that the coefficients has to match.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:55.580,00:09:02.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the two sides of an equality, right, both represented using Fourier series, you know
Dialogue: 0,00:09:02.580,00:09:04.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,that the coefficients has to match.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:04.580,00:09:11.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you're going to do a derivative, you have to write the derivative of your derivative
Dialogue: 0,00:09:11.580,00:09:12.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,as the e to the ikx.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:12.580,00:09:19.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,has to match. This is because if you study Fourier series analysis you know
Dialogue: 0,00:09:19.900,00:09:24.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,that you can multiply both sides of the equation with e to the ikx and
Dialogue: 0,00:09:24.340,00:09:29.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,integrate and you are going to isolate only one of the terms because the inner
Dialogue: 0,00:09:29.620,00:09:34.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,product of e to the ikx with the ik prime x is going to be zero if k is not
Dialogue: 0,00:09:34.900,00:09:41.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,equal to k prime. So you can isolate the terms from each other and say that so
Dialogue: 0,00:09:41.200,00:09:53.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,so the partial derivative of u hat of k, and by the way this is I
Dialogue: 0,00:09:53.500,00:09:57.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,shouldn't write this as a partial derivative anymore because u hat is only
Dialogue: 0,00:09:57.640,00:10:07.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,a function of t, this should be a du hat dt, right? Partial derivative operates
Dialogue: 0,00:10:07.440,00:10:10.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,only on functions of two variables. So this is
Dialogue: 0,00:10:10.960,00:10:11.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,d.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:11.200,00:10:17.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,du hat dt has to equal to minus k square u hat of k.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:24.340,00:10:26.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,Does this equation ring a bell with you?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:30.880,00:10:32.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes, thank you.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:32.140,00:10:33.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,I missed a larger kappa.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:35.340,00:10:40.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Should be minus a kappa times k square u hat k.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:41.200,00:10:41.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Thank you.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:43.740,00:10:52.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,So up to this point, we get no longer a partial differential equation, but a what?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:53.220,00:10:55.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,OD, ordinary differential equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:55.400,00:10:58.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,And do you know what is the solution to this ordinary differential equation?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:02.100,00:11:04.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's an exponential function, exactly.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:04.800,00:11:11.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,So u hat of k as a function of t is equal to u hat of k at time 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:11.200,00:11:18.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Whatever it is, times exponential of minus kappa k square t, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:20.780,00:11:23.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,The behavior of this function, let me go back.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:23.900,00:11:35.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,The behavior of this function is going to be like that.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:37.980,00:11:40.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for small k, when k is equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:41.200,00:11:43.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,What does the function look like?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:45.020,00:11:45.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's constant.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:48.620,00:11:51.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,So k equal to 0 means constant term.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:52.000,00:11:56.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So e to the i 0 x, which means that term doesn't depend on x.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:57.000,00:11:58.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's a constant in space.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:58.660,00:12:02.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So a constant in space term in the Fourier series doesn't change with time.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:02.960,00:12:07.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Come on.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:08.900,00:12:09.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:11.200,00:12:13.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you can do this.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:13.000,00:12:13.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,You can do this.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:13.400,00:12:16.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you can do this.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:16.360,00:12:17.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,You can do this.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:17.120,00:12:19.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, let's look at a small k.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:19.300,00:12:26.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for small k, it's the exponential decay, because minus kappa k square is always negative.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:29.780,00:12:32.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Small k is a slow exponential decay.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:35.360,00:12:40.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,And for the larger case, for the larger case,
Dialogue: 0,00:12:40.020,00:12:43.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,it can be a very steep exponential decay.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:51.140,00:12:55.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the solution to this differential equation
Dialogue: 0,00:12:55.300,00:13:00.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,is a decay to a constant.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:00.100,00:13:04.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because at the end, as t goes to infinity, so this is t.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:04.060,00:13:10.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,As t goes to infinity, all the terms become zero
Dialogue: 0,00:13:10.180,00:13:12.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,except for the k equal to zero term.
