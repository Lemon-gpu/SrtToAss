Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:15.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Approximating second-order derivative with finite difference. So the
Dialogue: 0,00:00:15.920,00:00:25.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,approximation error we define is basically this minus this. Okay
Dialogue: 0,00:00:25.040,00:00:35.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,approximation error is ui plus 1 plus ui minus 1 minus 2 ui divided by delta x
Dialogue: 0,00:00:35.440,00:00:44.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,square minus this. And one of the very powerful way to analyze the accuracy of
Dialogue: 0,00:00:44.500,00:00:50.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,an approximation scheme is Taylor series.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:55.040,00:01:04.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,Taylor series expands the solution at a particular point as a function of the
Dialogue: 0,00:01:04.340,00:01:11.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,values and derivatives of the same function at a different point. So for
Dialogue: 0,00:01:11.060,00:01:21.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,example ui plus 1 which is defined as the solution u at i times delta x, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:21.780,00:01:25.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because each grid spacing is delta x, the i-th gradient
Dialogue: 0,00:01:25.020,00:01:34.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,point is at x equal to i times delta x. Oh not i but i plus 1 delta x. So i delta x
Dialogue: 0,00:01:34.700,00:01:44.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,plus another delta x. It can be expanded using Taylor series assuming the
Dialogue: 0,00:01:44.160,00:01:54.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,function is smooth analytic. It is equal to k goes from 0 to infinity of
Dialogue: 0,00:01:55.020,00:02:15.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,u at i delta x of the k-th derivative times delta x to the k-th power and
Dialogue: 0,00:02:15.100,00:02:25.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,times 1 over k factorial. Right so this is the Taylor series of expanding the
Dialogue: 0,00:02:25.020,00:02:32.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,solution at a particular point. So we can see that the first term k equals 0 is
Dialogue: 0,00:02:35.100,00:02:42.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,the 0-th derivative which is u itself. And the second term is the first-order
Dialogue: 0,00:02:43.020,00:02:47.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,derivative. The third term is the second-order derivative which is what we
Dialogue: 0,00:02:47.260,00:02:54.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,are trying to approximate. And the third-order derivative etc. is something
Dialogue: 0,00:02:54.260,00:03:02.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,also we don't want. So basically in this Taylor series analysis we want to also
Dialogue: 0,00:03:02.260,00:03:09.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,write down the Taylor series of ui minus 1 and use the coefficients to cancel the
Dialogue: 0,00:03:09.260,00:03:17.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,0-th term, k equal to 0 term, cancel k equal to 1 term and preserve k equal to 2 term.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:17.260,00:03:22.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,And make the k equal to 3, 4, etc terms as small as we can. That's the first term.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:22.340,00:03:23.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,Thank you.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:24.260,00:03:34.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Something we want to do right now. ui minus 1 would be equal to ui delta x minus delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:34.260,00:03:43.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,It is equal to the same summation, same 1 over k factorial. This is just a copying Taylor series.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:43.260,00:03:52.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,i delta x except for instead of plus delta x here we get a minus delta x to the k-th power.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:52.260,00:03:53.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:54.260,00:04:00.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay. So now add them up.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:00.260,00:04:07.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let me make another page. What? Okay. Let me make another page for that.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:16.260,00:04:22.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Didn't know it does that. Okay. So of course you
Dialogue: 0,00:04:24.260,00:04:27.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,can see.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:27.260,00:04:39.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Of course ui is just equal to u of k i delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:39.260,00:04:46.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right. Only one term. So let's look at the accuracy of this scheme.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:46.260,00:04:56.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the solution error is 2 over delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:56.260,00:05:00.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let me just copy them down. Not 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:00.260,00:05:12.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's 1 over delta x times ui plus 1 plus 1 over delta x times ui minus 1 minus 2 over delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:12.260,00:05:14.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,By the way, it's squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:14.260,00:05:16.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:16.260,00:05:22.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the solution error is 1 over delta x times ui and also minus.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:22.260,00:05:31.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is plus and also minus partial x squared partial x squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:33.260,00:05:42.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,And for each of these terms, we are going to expand the Taylor series.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:42.260,00:05:46.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,The first term, we look at the first order.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:46.260,00:05:53.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right. So this one is proportional to u of i, which is also u at ix, i delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:53.260,00:05:56.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is ui prime.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:56.260,00:05:58.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is ui double prime.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:58.260,00:06:00.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,ui triple prime.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:00.260,00:06:03.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,ui quad prime.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:03.260,00:06:08.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this prime, I use it as shorthand for taking derivatives.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:08.260,00:06:09.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,1 prime is first order.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:09.260,00:06:11.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Double prime is second order.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:11.260,00:06:22.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,For example, if we just expand the second order derivative, we get, of course, 0, 0, minus 1, 0, 0, etc.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:22.260,00:06:24.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:24.260,00:06:31.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is, I'm writing down minus partial square u partial x squared as a linear combination of all the derivatives.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:31.260,00:06:37.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is at xi.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:37.260,00:06:38.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,OK.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:38.260,00:06:40.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Another example is when I look at the third term.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:40.260,00:06:43.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,The third term, which is also very easy.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:43.260,00:06:48.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,The first coefficient minus 2 over delta x squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:48.260,00:06:53.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,And all the other coefficients are 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:53.260,00:06:55.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:55.260,00:06:58.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,And these two terms are a little bit more tricky.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:58.260,00:07:02.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that we need to follow this Taylor series.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:02.260,00:07:07.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,The first term is 1 over delta x squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:07.260,00:07:15.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,The second term is 1 over delta x squared times the coefficient in the Taylor series, which is k equal to 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:15.260,00:07:18.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,1 over 1 factorial is 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:18.260,00:07:20.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is the first order derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:20.260,00:07:22.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,And delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:22.260,00:07:25.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So delta x is the only thing that comes out.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:25.260,00:07:26.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:26.260,00:07:32.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then the second order derivative, we still have 1 over delta x squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:32.260,00:07:35.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,And now 2 factorial is actually 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:35.260,00:07:39.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have delta x squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:39.260,00:07:42.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,The third term, still 1 over delta x squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:42.260,00:07:48.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,We have delta x to the cubed and 3 factorial.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:48.260,00:07:54.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,And delta x fourth, 4 factorial.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:54.260,00:08:03.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,The minus 1 term, the same, except for when we multiply by delta x, we multiply by minus delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:03.260,00:08:04.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,When we multiply by delta x squared, we multiply by minus delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:04.260,00:08:07.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,When we multiply by delta x squared, we multiply by minus delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:07.260,00:08:08.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,When we multiply by delta x squared, we multiply by minus delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:08.260,00:08:10.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Which is the same as delta x squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:10.260,00:08:15.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,And here, delta x cubed, we get a minus sign again.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:15.260,00:08:20.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,And fourth, we get no minus sign.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:20.260,00:08:23.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this goes on forever.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:23.260,00:08:27.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:27.260,00:08:33.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the cool thing is, when we add them up, what happens?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:33.260,00:08:37.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,First, let's look at the first term.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:37.260,00:08:46.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,When we add all the constant terms together, what happens?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:46.260,00:08:47.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:47.260,00:08:49.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,They cancel each other.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:49.260,00:08:52.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,They cancel each other, we get 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:52.260,00:08:53.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:53.260,00:08:55.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Minus 2, 1, 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:55.260,00:08:57.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,How about the second?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:57.260,00:08:58.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,0.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:58.260,00:08:59.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:59.260,00:09:01.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's a well-constructed scheme.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:01.260,00:09:02.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,We are canceling a lot of things.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:03.260,00:09:05.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,We are canceling a lot of terms.

Dialogue: 0,00:09:11.260,00:09:12.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:12.260,00:09:14.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,This and this cancels.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:14.260,00:09:16.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,We have half, half, and minus 1.

Dialogue: 0,00:09:18.260,00:09:24.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this minus 1 here, coming from here, is the only one that, if you just look at the

Dialogue: 0,00:09:32.260,00:09:36.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now if you look at this again, the third derivative term, 0 again.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:36.260,00:09:37.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right?

Dialogue: 0,00:09:38.260,00:09:43.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,But it can go on forever.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:43.260,00:09:44.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:44.260,00:09:48.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is the first term that it actually makes a non-zero error.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:48.260,00:09:50.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,And look at how small it is.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:50.260,00:09:56.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,The delta x squared cancels with the fourth, so we get square here.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:56.260,00:10:00.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,And at the 1 over 24th, what we get is delta x squared divided by 1 over 24.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:00.260,00:10:04.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is the first derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:04.260,00:10:11.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the second derivative is delta x squared divided by 12, times the fourth order derivative

Dialogue: 0,00:10:12.260,00:10:16.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is the leading term of the approximation error.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:16.260,00:10:22.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because all the follow on terms, this term is going to be delta x cubed something.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:22.260,00:10:23.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Maybe it's even 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:23.260,00:10:26.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is delta x fourth something.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:26.260,00:10:28.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,All the other terms.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:28.260,00:10:30.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,But remember, delta x is a small thing.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:30.260,00:10:34.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,In our previous example, it's 1 hundredth.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:34.260,00:10:39.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,That means delta x squared is going to be 10 to the minus 4.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:39.260,00:10:40.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:40.260,00:10:45.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,We are dividing by 12, and that makes it 10 to the minus 5.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:45.260,00:10:51.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we multiply it by the fourth order derivative of u, which may or may not be large, depending

Dialogue: 0,00:10:55.260,00:10:57.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this scheme works well.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:57.260,00:11:01.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,But the approximation error is something small.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:01.260,00:11:09.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Something scales, something decays to 0 very fast as delta x goes to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:09.260,00:11:11.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:11.260,00:11:17.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any questions about this?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:17.260,00:11:25.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this scheme also makes it easy for us to construct approximations.
