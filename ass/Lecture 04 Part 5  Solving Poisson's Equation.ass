Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:11.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now we have the matrix and given a right hand side we can solve the equation for U.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:11.000,00:00:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's just try it. What kind of right hand side would you like to try?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:22.000,00:00:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Anybody give a suggestion?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:25.000,00:00:27.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,A sinusoidal one.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:27.000,00:00:39.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,A sinusoidal one? Okay, so you want F to be...
Dialogue: 0,00:00:39.000,00:00:45.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Sine of what?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:45.000,00:00:47.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Huh?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:47.000,00:00:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,X times Y? So we don't have any X or Y yet. So let's do this. Let's construct the X and Y.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:54.000,00:00:57.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, is mesh grid in 2D?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:57.000,00:01:05.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, okay, so let's look at... I think mesh grid is what can help you to construct X and Y.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:05.000,00:01:12.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It returns a 2D grid coordinate based on vectors X and Y.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:12.000,00:01:21.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, okay, so let's say X is equal to 1 to NX minus 1 times DX.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:21.000,00:01:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Y is equal to 1 to NY minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:24.000,00:01:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Come on, minus 1 times DX.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:26.000,00:01:27.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:27.000,00:01:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I think that's it. I think just do big X and big Y equal to mesh grid X and Y.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:36.000,00:01:39.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's see if I get the right thing.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:39.000,00:01:43.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Big X is going to be a 31 by 31 matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:43.000,00:01:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So...
Dialogue: 0,00:01:52.000,00:01:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's actually the opposite of what I wanted to get.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:56.000,00:02:03.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I want... So this is the first index. I want the first index to correspond to the X direction.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:03.000,00:02:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I want the second index to correspond to the Y direction.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:06.000,00:02:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So...
Dialogue: 0,00:02:08.000,00:02:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let me just switch them over. I will just do Y and X.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:14.000,00:02:15.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:15.000,00:02:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this index corresponds to the X direction. This corresponds to the Y direction.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:20.000,00:02:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's what we had in this indexing, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:24.000,00:02:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the first index corresponds to incrementing X.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:28.000,00:02:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The second index corresponds to incrementing Y.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:30.000,00:02:35.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you look at Y, it's the other way. It's going this way.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:35.000,00:02:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:36.000,00:02:39.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So...
Dialogue: 0,00:02:39.000,00:02:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think you wanted F equal to sine X times cosine Y or something.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:50.000,00:02:51.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:51.000,00:02:53.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we get an F that is 31 by 31.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:53.000,00:03:01.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,How do you convert the 31 to 31 matrix into this?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:01.000,00:03:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Huh?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:04.000,00:03:13.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you do mat to vac...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:13.000,00:03:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is it...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:14.000,00:03:21.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, I think reshape is the same as reshape.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:21.000,00:03:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:22.000,00:03:23.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:23.000,00:03:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:24.000,00:03:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think it's the best approach.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:25.000,00:03:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,But like, in order to reshape it to into the format of what we want, because MATLAB does it the other way, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:32.000,00:03:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we need to do...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:34.000,00:03:39.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,We need to reshape it of...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:39.000,00:03:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's actually make big F equal to sine X times cosine Y.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:48.000,00:03:51.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that big F is a matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:51.000,00:04:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we need to do small F equal to reshape of F transpose into NX minus 1 times NY minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:02.000,00:04:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:04.000,00:04:05.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:05.000,00:04:07.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's see.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:07.000,00:04:11.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Huh.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:11.000,00:04:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Actually, I don't think I can see much from that.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:14.000,00:04:15.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:15.000,00:04:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's say sine of X times cosine of Y.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:18.000,00:04:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in the beginning...
Dialogue: 0,00:04:20.000,00:04:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,In the beginning of the matrix...
Dialogue: 0,00:04:22.000,00:04:27.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Of the vector, I should have R equal to 1, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:27.000,00:04:33.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I should have R equal to 1 and J increases.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:33.000,00:04:43.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I should have a very small number because it's sine of a very small X times a slowly decaying number.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:43.000,00:04:49.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's see if that's what I get.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:49.000,00:04:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:52.000,00:04:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think that's right.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:54.000,00:04:55.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:55.000,00:05:03.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is like sine of delta X times cosine of delta X, cosine of 2 delta X, cosine of 3 delta X, etc.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:03.000,00:05:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:04.000,00:05:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So from the ICE inspection, it looks right.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:10.000,00:05:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,We can also create a surface plot of big F.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:16.000,00:05:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's do X, Y, and F.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:19.000,00:05:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's what my F looks like.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:24.000,00:05:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we can do X label X, Y label Y.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:30.000,00:05:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,That'll give me...
Dialogue: 0,00:05:32.000,00:05:37.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is X, this is Y, and the Z axis is of course my F.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:37.000,00:05:39.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:39.000,00:05:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I think it's the right trend.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:42.000,00:05:47.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,X increases, sine function increases, and cosine function decreases.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:47.000,00:05:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now I have my small F.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:50.000,00:05:58.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's do U is equal to matrix backslash F.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:58.000,00:06:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I get my U.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:00.000,00:06:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:02.000,00:06:05.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,How do I visualize my U?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:05.000,00:06:13.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I get my U, which is a 961 by 1 array.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:13.000,00:06:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I need to reshape it back to...
Dialogue: 0,00:06:16.000,00:06:19.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,a matrix before I can visualize it.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:19.000,00:06:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's say my big U is equal to reshape of small u.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:25.000,00:06:29.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And again, MATLAB, we need to do...
Dialogue: 0,00:06:29.000,00:06:31.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,We need to make it...
Dialogue: 0,00:06:31.000,00:06:33.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,NY minus 1 first.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:33.000,00:06:35.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And X minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:35.000,00:06:37.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Transpose.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:37.000,00:06:39.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:39.000,00:06:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So when we reshape that way, we transpose first, and then reshape it.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:44.000,00:06:45.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,In the reverse...
Dialogue: 0,00:06:45.000,00:06:51.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,In the inverse operation, we need to reshape it into the transposed shape of F.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:51.000,00:06:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then transpose it back.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:56.000,00:07:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's do the same serve, but now with U.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:02.000,00:07:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's what my solution looks like.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:06.000,00:07:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:08.000,00:07:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The Laplacian of this U is equal to F.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:15.000,00:07:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the Laplacian, which means the X...
Dialogue: 0,00:07:18.000,00:07:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The second order derivative of X plus the second order derivative of Y.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:22.000,00:07:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's some kind of curvature in 2D.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:26.000,00:07:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the positive Laplacian curves in a convex way.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:30.000,00:07:31.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So curves...
Dialogue: 0,00:07:31.000,00:07:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is what a positive Laplacian looks like.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:36.000,00:07:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if you rotate it a little bit...
Dialogue: 0,00:07:38.000,00:07:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's maximize and rotate it a little bit.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:40.000,00:07:43.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,You should also be able to see that...
Dialogue: 0,00:07:43.000,00:07:47.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The curvature is larger towards this side.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:47.000,00:07:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:48.000,00:07:49.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Towards the...
Dialogue: 0,00:07:49.000,00:07:53.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Towards the X equal to 1, Y equal to 0 side.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:53.000,00:07:57.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's do X label, Y label.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:57.000,00:08:01.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So X equal to 1, Y equal to 0 side.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:01.000,00:08:03.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,You see, like the...
Dialogue: 0,00:08:03.000,00:08:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The bottom of this function shifts...

Dialogue: 0,00:08:12.000,00:08:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's because the curvature is larger in this side.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:16.000,00:08:17.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if you...
