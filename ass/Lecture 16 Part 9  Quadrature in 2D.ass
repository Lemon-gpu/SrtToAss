Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay and one last thing I want to just tell you in two dimensions is how do we integrate arbitrary functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:14.000,00:00:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So how do we evaluate the integral of v and f for a known but arbitrary function f on the right hand side.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:22.000,00:00:27.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,In one dimension, how did we do that?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:27.000,00:00:45.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,We had Gauss quadrature, right? So we represented this as, approximate this as a summation of wi times vxi and fxi, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:45.000,00:00:49.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,In two dimensions, we can do exactly the same thing.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:49.000,00:00:55.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,But the Gauss quadrature points and weights are going to be adapted to the two dimensional form.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:55.000,00:00:57.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in a triangle, there are two dimensions.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:57.000,00:01:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,There are very good, very nice Gauss quadrature points.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:00.000,00:01:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in a triangle, there are points that are going to give you very accurate quadrature for like for triangle elements.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:10.000,00:01:15.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And for other elements, you can also get it.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:15.000,00:01:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And one of the actually very active and still very difficult points for further research is
Dialogue: 0,00:01:24.000,00:01:27.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,how do you come up with good quadrature points for arbitrary functions?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:27.000,00:01:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And for example, people are starting to think about how do I apply finite element to the kind of mesh we dealt with in finite volume.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:40.000,00:01:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Remember in finite volume, we can use really arbitrary types of mesh.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:46.000,00:01:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Like we looked at triangular mesh.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:48.000,00:01:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,We also looked at this kind of adaptive mesh environment where one element can interface with many different elements.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:56.000,00:02:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we can use many different, many different other neighboring elements.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:02.000,00:02:11.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,But deriving a quadrature scheme for this kind of arbitrary elements, which may shape like that, right, can be pretty difficult.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:11.000,00:02:15.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And how to do this is still quite an open question.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:15.000,00:02:21.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that completes our finite element discussion.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:21.000,00:02:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And there is going to be another project out today.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:25.000,00:02:29.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So there is also no lecture on Wednesday.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:29.000,00:02:31.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'll see you.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:31.000,00:02:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the next lecture is going to be next Monday.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:34.000,00:02:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:36.000,00:02:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any questions?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:38.000,00:02:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,What if f has a divergence in the element?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:42.000,00:02:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,How do you integrate that?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:44.000,00:02:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,What if f has a what?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:46.000,00:02:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,A divergence, like an infinite delta function.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:48.000,00:02:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,How do you integrate that?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:50.000,00:02:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,If f has a delta function, then the integration is going to be like this.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:54.000,00:02:59.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The integration of a delta function with v is going to be just the value of v at that point.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:59.000,00:03:03.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And because v is a piecewise linear function, that's actually easy to do.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:03.000,00:03:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:04.000,00:03:07.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Like you do a quaternary, you kind of, you don't know that even.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:07.000,00:03:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Exactly.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:08.000,00:03:12.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you, quadrature only works for smooth, at least continuous f's.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:12.000,00:03:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you don't have a continuous f, then you split it into continuous pieces.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:16.000,00:03:21.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you have delta functions, pull the delta function part out of the f.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:21.000,00:03:23.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then use quadrature on the continuous, single, and continuous f.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:24.000,00:03:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,On the smooth portion of f.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:26.000,00:03:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,On the non-smooth portion of f, you do something else.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:28.000,00:03:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Quadrature, don't use quadrature on delta functions or non-continuous functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:34.000,00:03:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:36.000,00:03:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:52.000,00:03:53.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Professor.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:53.000,00:03:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:54.000,00:03:58.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I found out the other day that my friend actually works for Professor Laccarino.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:58.000,00:03:59.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, Laccarino?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:59.000,00:04:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:00.000,00:04:01.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:01.000,00:04:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Isn't he your advisor?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:02.000,00:04:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, he was my co-advisor at Stanford.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:04.000,00:04:05.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:05.000,00:04:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Cool.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:06.000,00:04:07.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:07.000,00:04:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,He, I think you gave a talk.
