Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:12.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the type of numerical techniques we are going to study in this course include what's called finite difference, finite volume, finite element, boundary element.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:13.680,00:00:25.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,So these four methods, each of them are suitable for different type of partial differential equations under different geometric and environmental conditions.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:25.700,00:00:38.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,These methods are going to convert or approximate a partial differential equation with equations that we can put into and solve in computers.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:38.640,00:00:44.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So computers are good at manipulating numbers.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:46.380,00:00:55.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,And these methods convert differential equations, approximate them into equations that...
Dialogue: 0,00:00:55.700,00:01:05.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,computers can solve directly. They can, for example, solve into solutions of matrix equations, AX equal to B.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:07.000,00:01:17.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then we are also going to talk about direct and iterative solution methods for actually solving this kind of AX equal to B equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:18.240,00:01:22.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,And many of you think AX equal to B is easy.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:22.980,00:01:25.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you know MATLAB or other...
Dialogue: 0,00:01:25.700,00:01:32.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,packages, you can just solve with one line of code.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:34.020,00:01:35.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,In MATLAB, that's backslash.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:35.940,00:01:37.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,How many of you know backslash?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:38.340,00:01:39.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, that's good.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:39.840,00:01:42.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,In Python, it's linear algebra dot solve.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:42.920,00:01:44.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,How many of you know that?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:44.820,00:01:45.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so good.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:45.720,00:01:55.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,But the type of AX equal to B we may get in partial differential equations may be beyond the capability of backslash.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:55.700,00:01:57.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or linear algebra dot solve.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:57.700,00:02:03.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's because they are so large.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:03.700,00:02:15.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,They can be orders of magnitude larger than the kind of even memory requirement of just directly solving AX equal to B.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:15.700,00:02:21.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that is why we will be talking about iterative solution methods for solving these kind of equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:21.700,00:02:23.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,Which is a result of discretizing a partial differential equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:23.700,00:02:24.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that is why we will be talking about iterative solution methods for solving these kind of equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:24.260,00:02:31.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or discretizing a partial differential equation using finite difference, finite volume, finite element, or boundary element method.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:33.300,00:02:35.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this class-
Dialogue: 0,00:02:35.220,00:02:38.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,the good news is that there is no exam.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:39.380,00:02:41.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,No midterm, no final.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:43.380,00:02:45.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,But don't be happy yet.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:46.500,00:02:50.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because we have eight project sets.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:51.220,00:02:54.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,And each project set can be-
Dialogue: 0,00:02:54.260,00:03:06.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,very exhausting or very time-consuming task. So these projects, they are
Dialogue: 0,00:03:06.760,00:03:11.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,quite different from the kind of homework assignments you may be used to
Dialogue: 0,00:03:11.940,00:03:19.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,in undergraduate studies. They usually require you to take a problem that is
Dialogue: 0,00:03:19.020,00:03:26.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,not yet very well formulated. So you take a problem that may not be immediately
Dialogue: 0,00:03:26.100,00:03:33.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,obvious how to start even go to solve it. And then you need to not only apply what
Dialogue: 0,00:03:33.640,00:03:40.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,you learned in class, but also you may have to try things yourself or even go
Dialogue: 0,00:03:40.320,00:03:47.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,to the Internet, look for solutions or even look for papers and read what is
Dialogue: 0,00:03:47.220,00:03:49.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,in the literature to figure out the solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:49.000,00:03:58.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Another thing is the amount of coding and debugging you may expect to do to
Dialogue: 0,00:03:58.540,00:04:05.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,solve these projects can be pretty intensive. That aspect depends a lot on
Dialogue: 0,00:04:05.080,00:04:12.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,how much experience you have on coding. So if you have written a hundred
Dialogue: 0,00:04:12.200,00:04:15.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,thousand lines of code in your lifetime, you probably don't really worry about
Dialogue: 0,00:04:15.240,00:04:17.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,that. But if you are new to coding, you might have to do a lot of work to solve it.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:17.200,00:04:18.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you have written a hundred thousand lines of code in your lifetime, you probably don't really worry about that. But if you are new to
Dialogue: 0,00:04:18.960,00:04:24.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,programming then it may take a significant amount of time for you to
Dialogue: 0,00:04:24.820,00:04:33.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,just get familiar with being able to program a significant code starting
Dialogue: 0,00:04:33.400,00:04:43.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,from scratch to solve a problem. And on top of being able to write software,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:43.320,00:04:46.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,write code to solve problems,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:46.500,00:04:48.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,you should expect a reasonable amount of time to solve these problems. And once
Dialogue: 0,00:04:48.540,00:04:59.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,a huge difference between writing numerical code and writing regular code for other computer science applications.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:59.600,00:05:05.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this difference especially shows up in the debugging phase.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:05.040,00:05:12.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,So debugging a regular computer code is easy compared to debugging numerical code.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:12.900,00:05:23.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because debugging regular computer code, if something blows up or if something has a memory leak or something, you can procedurally, you can really...
Dialogue: 0,00:05:23.660,00:05:30.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you are a veteran programmer, you know how to trace the bug, find where it is.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:30.500,00:05:40.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,But debugging a numerical code not only requires regular computer science skills, but requires a lot of mathematical reasoning.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:40.360,00:05:42.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,If your code
Dialogue: 0,00:05:42.160,00:05:49.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,doesn't really crash, doesn't really segmentation fault, but slowly goes to infinity,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:49.260,00:05:52.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,instead of producing the answer you expect,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:52.260,00:06:00.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,how do you trace the bug? How do you find out which part of the code, which line of code is responsible for that slowly diverging to infinity?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:00.820,00:06:03.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or just producing an utterly wrong answer?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:03.720,00:06:07.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's very non-obvious.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:07.120,00:06:12.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Developing that skill is a significant portion of this class.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:12.120,00:06:19.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So especially in the beginning, expect to spend a lot of time developing that skill.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:19.120,00:06:24.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is the most...
Dialogue: 0,00:06:24.180,00:06:32.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,By talking to students who took this class before, this is probably the single most challenging part of this course.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:32.160,00:06:39.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is doing the projects and figuring out how to debug my code that doesn't produce the right answer.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:39.660,00:06:40.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,OK.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:40.920,00:06:41.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,The worst thing you can do is to use a lot of your time to develop your code.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:41.920,00:06:44.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the worst thing you can do is to start the project too late.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:44.820,00:06:50.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because you expect to write this amount of code, but the time it may take for you to debug it may be
Dialogue: 0,00:06:50.980,00:06:56.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,a lot longer than you need to write it.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:56.360,00:07:01.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the collaboration policy is unstellar, but in a nutshell,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:01.180,00:07:06.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,you are very much encouraged to discuss with each other.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:06.220,00:07:11.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that's why I have everybody introduce yourself to other people.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:11.320,00:07:17.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,So discussion, collaboration is very encouraged, but...
Dialogue: 0,00:07:17.660,00:07:22.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,The outcome of the discussion should completely be in your mind.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:22.320,00:07:27.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,You're not supposed to type down stuff during your discussion and take it home with you.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:27.860,00:07:33.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Absolutely no sharing of code or any documentation.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:33.080,00:07:37.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,OK, so any discussion you need to...
Dialogue: 0,00:07:37.920,00:07:41.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,absorb the result of the discussion in your mind.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:41.320,00:07:48.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,And code and write documentation, write the reports completely separately.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:48.820,00:07:52.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Understood?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:52.320,00:07:53.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:53.920,00:07:55.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,OK.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:55.160,00:07:57.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any questions so far?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:57.020,00:08:01.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Before we go into the technical portion of this lecture?
