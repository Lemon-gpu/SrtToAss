Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:13.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for example, there is this equation called the Berkeley-Leverett equation
Dialogue: 0,00:00:13.400,00:00:19.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,that models how oil and water flows in the porous media, for example, an oil
Dialogue: 0,00:00:19.920,00:00:27.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,reservoir. Okay, so and particularly describes the flow of oil and water
Dialogue: 0,00:00:27.300,00:00:35.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,under a constant driven flow. So think of the total volumetric flow is constant.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:35.860,00:00:43.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you have a porous media, you have a sponge or rock or something, and you have
Dialogue: 0,00:00:43.940,00:00:48.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,your injecting water on the left side and you see what comes out on the right
Dialogue: 0,00:00:48.980,00:00:56.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,side. And because oil and water have different properties, they don't really
Dialogue: 0,00:00:56.460,00:00:57.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,mix together.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:57.220,00:00:57.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the beauty of the flow is what it can merge into. So for example, if I have a
Dialogue: 0,00:00:57.280,00:01:01.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,very well but the some of them are trapping small pores and they're off
Dialogue: 0,00:01:01.720,00:01:08.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,surface tension etc if you look at the time evolution of a saturation for
Dialogue: 0,00:01:08.260,00:01:17.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,example of oil DT it is not going to be so if if oil and water they are the same
Dialogue: 0,00:01:17.380,00:01:25.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,material they are the same of the so if there is no porous media the situation
Dialogue: 0,00:01:25.540,00:01:33.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,just at bats in a pipe linearly I would have partial s o partial X equal to zero
Dialogue: 0,00:01:33.460,00:01:37.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,right so that's linear vector equation if I have a certain waveform of
Dialogue: 0,00:01:37.660,00:01:41.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,saturation in the beginning that way would shift towards the right if there
Dialogue: 0,00:01:41.900,00:01:47.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,was no porous media but the existence of porous media makes it a nonlinear
Dialogue: 0,00:01:47.500,00:01:55.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,conservation law the F actually depends on the saturation at that local point
Dialogue: 0,00:01:55.300,00:01:55.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,okay
Dialogue: 0,00:01:55.500,00:01:55.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,okay
Dialogue: 0,00:01:55.520,00:02:25.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:25.520,00:02:31.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,region the flux of oil oil is more like in the free flow is in the bigger pour
Dialogue: 0,00:02:31.280,00:02:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so that they get pushed faster and as you approach full saturation equal to
Dialogue: 0,00:02:38.000,00:02:46.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,warm everything is oil and water is now trapped into small pores that makes the
Dialogue: 0,00:02:46.280,00:02:51.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,flux of oil to be more or less independent of how much water there is
Dialogue: 0,00:02:51.320,00:03:00.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,so it's it the curve becomes flat again so this is this is a an example of a
Dialogue: 0,00:03:00.580,00:03:06.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,scalar conservation law where you can use only one variable to denote the
Dialogue: 0,00:03:06.140,00:03:14.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,state and all flux is a direct a scalar function of that one one variable more
Dialogue: 0,00:03:14.200,00:03:21.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,often we have a system of conservation laws in which my U is a vector and
Dialogue: 0,00:03:21.280,00:03:21.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,it has a function that is a value of u so if I have a function that is a state and I
Dialogue: 0,00:03:21.300,00:03:26.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,is momentum and density, for example, or momentum, density, and energy.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:27.220,00:03:33.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the flux of mass would depend on the momentum.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:34.380,00:03:37.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,The flux of momentum would depend on the density.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:37.320,00:03:40.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,The flux of energy would depend on also momentum and energy.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:40.500,00:03:43.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you have a system of conservation loss,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:43.320,00:03:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,but then always the flux, be it a vector or a scalar,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:48.000,00:03:52.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,is completely determined by the state at that local point.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:53.640,00:03:56.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,The state can be, again, a scalar or a vector.
