Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:09.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,There is a very general way to analyze numerical schemes. That is, we want to
Dialogue: 0,00:00:09.720,00:00:15.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,have convergence, which is we want to have my u hat goes to u analytic as
Dialogue: 0,00:00:15.360,00:00:24.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,delta x and delta t goes to 0. This is what I want, right? Because I want
Dialogue: 0,00:00:24.360,00:00:29.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,analytical solution, but u hat, the numerical solution, is all I can
Dialogue: 0,00:00:29.560,00:00:35.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,compute. So if I look at the difference between them, I want that to go to 0 as I
Dialogue: 0,00:00:35.200,00:00:41.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,invest more and more computational resources. But all I can know is
Dialogue: 0,00:00:41.500,00:00:47.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,consistency. So I can analyze beforehand if I'm developing a numerical scheme. All
Dialogue: 0,00:00:47.780,00:00:56.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,I know is how does tau goes to 0 as delta x and delta t goes to 0. Tau is
Dialogue: 0,00:00:56.500,00:00:59.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,the approximation of all the differential operators
Dialogue: 0,00:00:59.540,00:01:09.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,in my differential equation. So this is consistency. So what we analyzed
Dialogue: 0,00:01:09.080,00:01:16.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,beforehand is that if I in addition have stability, which in the previous example
Dialogue: 0,00:01:16.880,00:01:25.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,means just the norm of a is less than 1, a is the amplification of the solution
Dialogue: 0,00:01:25.740,00:01:29.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,error as time increases.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:29.540,00:01:38.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,That means if I have stability and I have consistency, when both is satisfied,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:38.660,00:01:46.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,I will get convergence.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:46.600,00:01:52.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So when you are solving a differential equation, you want to check consistency, yes or no.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:52.040,00:01:56.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,As I increase my mesh resolution, decrease time steps, do I have the truncation error
Dialogue: 0,00:01:56.140,00:01:57.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,go to 0?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:57.140,00:01:58.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,I want to check stability.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:58.140,00:01:59.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,I want to check the time steps. Do I have the truncation error go to 0? I want to check stability.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:59.540,00:02:06.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,If I don't have truncation error, would my solution error decay to 0 eventually?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:06.140,00:02:12.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,For example, a good case to check is when the analytical solution is 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:12.320,00:02:17.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you put up the numerical solution slightly, would it go back to 0?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:17.120,00:02:19.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then you should have convergence.
