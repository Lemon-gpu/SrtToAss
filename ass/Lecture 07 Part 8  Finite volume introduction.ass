Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:11.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,So remember in our finite difference if we draw a function we are discretizing
Dialogue: 0,00:00:11.880,00:00:19.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,the function by storing the values of the function at the grid points and then
Dialogue: 0,00:00:19.260,00:00:25.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,we use Taylor series a manipulation that is intrinsically differential to
Dialogue: 0,00:00:25.840,00:00:32.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,approximate the differential operators just using these points now you should
Dialogue: 0,00:00:32.200,00:00:43.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,understand finite volume in finite volume if I draw the same function I do
Dialogue: 0,00:00:43.000,00:00:46.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,a function like that
Dialogue: 0,00:00:53.560,00:00:55.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,if I draw a similar function
Dialogue: 0,00:00:55.840,00:01:09.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,this is what I have in the computer what I have is the average over these finite
Dialogue: 0,00:01:09.800,00:01:16.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,volumes these are intervals in 1D but they are going to be truly volumes in 3D
Dialogue: 0,00:01:16.060,00:01:21.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,they are areas in 2D they are the average values of the function inside these
Dialogue: 0,00:01:21.460,00:01:22.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,volumes
Dialogue: 0,00:01:22.460,00:01:25.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,why is that?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:25.840,00:01:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the case well two things one is that now I'm really representing the function I
Dialogue: 0,00:01:34.000,00:01:38.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,have a complete form of the function but piecewise constant and
Dialogue: 0,00:01:38.140,00:01:46.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,that form actually does respect that the function can be discontinuous
Dialogue: 0,00:01:46.240,00:01:52.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,right actually it even represents a continuous and smooth function as
Dialogue: 0,00:01:52.960,00:01:55.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,piecewise discontinuous functions
Dialogue: 0,00:01:55.840,00:02:04.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I think that is perfect in there and there we are all set thereī governed by
Dialogue: 0,00:02:04.640,00:02:17.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,linear
Dialogue: 0,00:02:17.360,00:02:18.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,series
Dialogue: 0,00:02:18.920,00:02:24.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,all right let's see if you done that
Dialogue: 0,00:02:24.040,00:02:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,did you mix them up well let's try actually show the difference I'm gonna try to show
Dialogue: 0,00:02:25.000,00:02:35.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,volume averages, how does it relate to one of the forms we discussed?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:35.760,00:02:41.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,It does relate to only the integral form.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:41.380,00:02:48.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because if you look at the integral of the value over a and b, and think of this a and
Dialogue: 0,00:02:48.400,00:02:56.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,b as the boundary of one of the intervals, how does the integral relate to the average
Dialogue: 0,00:02:56.400,00:03:03.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,over the interval?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:03.160,00:03:06.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,So how does average relate to the integral?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:06.820,00:03:11.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,What is the correct way to average a function over a continuous domain?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:11.220,00:03:12.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:12.220,00:03:16.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,Just the integral of the function over the x?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:16.500,00:03:17.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,Over the domain size, yes.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:17.900,00:03:23.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,Just the integral of the function over the size of the domain is just the value, is the
Dialogue: 0,00:03:23.140,00:03:28.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,average, is the mathematical definition of the average of the function over that small
Dialogue: 0,00:03:28.660,00:03:31.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,interval.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:31.140,00:03:37.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it is a direct representation, not even an approximation.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:37.740,00:03:47.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is exact, that the left-hand side infinite volume can be exactly written as the time
Dialogue: 0,00:03:47.740,00:03:53.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,derivative of the volume size, which is constant, times the volume average.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:53.980,00:03:56.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:56.520,00:04:12.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,So d dt of u dx is exactly equal to the size of the volume, b minus a, times d u bar a b
Dialogue: 0,00:04:12.300,00:04:13.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,dt.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:13.300,00:04:13.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this u bar over a and b is exactly what we saw.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:13.980,00:04:14.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we can write the derivative of the volume size, which is constant, times the volume
Dialogue: 0,00:04:14.980,00:04:15.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,average.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:15.980,00:04:16.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:16.900,00:04:21.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is exactly what we saw in the infinite volume.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:21.140,00:04:22.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:22.940,00:04:27.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now what are we missing to get the derivative?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:27.500,00:04:31.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is equal to flux at a minus flux of b.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:31.080,00:04:34.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:34.020,00:04:43.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,We need to somehow compute the flux of the function at the left and right of each interval,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:43.140,00:04:47.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,at the boundaries of these discrete small volumes.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:47.140,00:04:55.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we actually don't have the information here, because if you look at the continuous
Dialogue: 0,00:04:55.520,00:04:59.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,function, the value of the function is here.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:59.820,00:05:05.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the flux can be computed by evaluating the flux function, which is an analytic function,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:05.980,00:05:09.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,at this value of u, which is last.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:09.180,00:05:10.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,We only know that the value is somehow at the end of the function.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:10.180,00:05:11.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we can write the derivative of the function at the end of the function.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:11.180,00:05:12.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we can also compute the flux function at the end of the function.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:12.180,00:05:17.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's somehow in between this average and this average.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:17.420,00:05:19.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,We don't know what the value is.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:19.940,00:05:24.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is that necessary to know that the very next interval is not in between the two?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:24.940,00:05:25.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Exactly.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:25.940,00:05:30.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,That may not even be true, because over the next interval, the value of the function at
Dialogue: 0,00:05:30.240,00:05:32.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,the interval is right here.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:32.360,00:05:39.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,It lies even outside the range of the left domain average and right domain average.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:39.400,00:05:40.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the final volume involves the flux.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:40.220,00:05:41.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the final volume involves the flux.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:41.220,00:05:42.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the final volume involves the flux.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:42.180,00:05:43.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the final volume involves the flux.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:43.200,00:05:44.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the final volume involves the flux.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:44.200,00:05:45.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the final volume involves the flux.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:45.200,00:05:49.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,And it involves approximation not on the differential operator, but on the function itself.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:49.420,00:05:57.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,You have to somehow interpolate the function, not in the classical sense of interpolating
Dialogue: 0,00:05:57.540,00:06:00.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,from some points to some other points.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:00.580,00:06:06.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,It is interpolating the function from the averages of the function over domains to values
Dialogue: 0,00:06:06.420,00:06:09.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,of the function on the domain boundaries.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:09.940,00:06:10.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,To the limit, to the extension.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:10.940,00:06:11.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,OK.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:11.940,00:06:14.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,to the pointwise values is the approximation
Dialogue: 0,00:06:14.940,00:06:19.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,we need to invoke in a finite volume approximation
Dialogue: 0,00:06:19.940,00:06:21.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,for solving differential equations.
