Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:05.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,ok so let's go to MATLAB and figure out
Dialogue: 0,00:00:05.580,00:00:13.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,how to implement this. Close all. So what we
Dialogue: 0,00:00:13.600,00:00:17.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,do is let's say we construct a right hand
Dialogue: 0,00:00:17.560,00:00:26.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,side. So let's say n is equal to 16 to
Dialogue: 0,00:00:26.220,00:00:31.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,start with and let's make f equal to 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:31.140,00:00:34.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is our right hand side
Dialogue: 0,00:00:34.620,00:00:41.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,for f and let's also make the boundary
Dialogue: 0,00:00:41.340,00:00:45.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,conditions to be 0. So u of 0 is equal to
Dialogue: 0,00:00:45.660,00:00:49.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,u of n plus 1 is equal to 0. So we don't
Dialogue: 0,00:00:49.200,00:00:51.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,have these terms when we are approaching
Dialogue: 0,00:00:51.720,00:00:52.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,the boundary.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:52.800,00:00:55.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:56.220,00:01:00.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,And let's make u to be 0s and 1s.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:00.240,00:01:03.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's our initial guess. Initial guess can
Dialogue: 0,00:01:03.180,00:01:08.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,be anything and as long as our Jaccobby
Dialogue: 0,00:01:08.060,00:01:10.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,iteration matrix has less than one
Dialogue: 0,00:01:10.900,00:01:13.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,eigenvalues, then it doesn't matter what
Dialogue: 0,00:01:13.200,00:01:14.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,your initial condition is. You're going to
Dialogue: 0,00:01:14.820,00:01:17.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,converge to the right value. If your
Dialogue: 0,00:01:17.260,00:01:19.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,initial condition, if your initial guess is
Dialogue: 0,00:01:19.560,00:01:21.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,close to the true solution, you're going
Dialogue: 0,00:01:21.500,00:01:24.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,to converge a little bit faster but
Dialogue: 0,00:01:24.280,00:01:25.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,nevertheless you're going to converge.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:25.800,00:01:29.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's pretty commonplace to use a
Dialogue: 0,00:01:29.120,00:01:33.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,zero initial guess. Now our next
Dialogue: 0,00:01:33.300,00:01:36.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,is to, let's actually multiply this thing
Dialogue: 0,00:01:36.300,00:01:39.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,to the other side to make our formula a
Dialogue: 0,00:01:39.420,00:01:42.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,little bit cleaner. So this is going to be
Dialogue: 0,00:01:42.180,00:01:47.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,minus delta x squared over 2 times f of i
Dialogue: 0,00:01:47.040,00:01:53.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,and this is going to be plus half of ui
Dialogue: 0,00:01:53.280,00:01:55.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,plus 1k
Dialogue: 0,00:01:55.120,00:01:59.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,plus ui minus 1k. Both are half because
Dialogue: 0,00:01:59.220,00:02:03.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,these are 1 over delta x squared, these are 2 over
Dialogue: 0,00:02:03.180,00:02:08.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,delta x squared. Okay. So now we start,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:08.800,00:02:12.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,let's perform one iteration. Okay. So
Dialogue: 0,00:02:12.580,00:02:20.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,uk, uk plus 1 would be equal to the
Dialogue: 0,00:02:20.620,00:02:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,existing, okay so it's going to be delta x,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:25.120,00:02:26.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,I haven't completed delta x yet, so
Dialogue: 0,00:02:26.860,00:02:31.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,let's imagine our domain is 1 and in
Dialogue: 0,00:02:31.360,00:02:33.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,final difference we are dividing this
Dialogue: 0,00:02:33.640,00:02:37.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,one domain size by n plus 1, right. So
Dialogue: 0,00:02:37.720,00:02:44.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,uk plus 1 is going to be minus delta x
Dialogue: 0,00:02:44.440,00:02:53.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,squared divided by 2 times f. Alright so
Dialogue: 0,00:02:53.740,00:02:56.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,let's first make this first. So we get a
Dialogue: 0,00:02:56.980,00:03:02.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,uk plus 1 and then we add this part. So
Dialogue: 0,00:03:02.140,00:03:06.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,this part is going to be calculated like
Dialogue: 0,00:03:06.520,00:03:12.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,that. So for i goes from 1 to n. So okay
Dialogue: 0,00:03:12.500,00:03:15.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,so I first want to add the i plus 1
Dialogue: 0,00:03:15.200,00:03:20.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,part. So if i is less than n, I want to
Dialogue: 0,00:03:20.500,00:03:23.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,say uk plus 1 of i plus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:23.740,00:03:33.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay so i is equal to itself plus u of i
Dialogue: 0,00:03:33.420,00:03:38.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,plus 1 divided by 2. Okay else if i is
Dialogue: 0,00:03:38.680,00:03:46.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,greater than 1, you, oh not else, sorry. So
Dialogue: 0,00:03:46.500,00:03:50.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,so let's, okay so let's let's initialize
Dialogue: 0,00:03:50.960,00:03:53.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,zeros again. So not else if because I, you
Dialogue: 0,00:03:53.540,00:04:00.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,if i is in the middle, I both wanted to be added with i plus 1 and i minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:01.140,00:04:04.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it should be another if, not else if.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:04.660,00:04:07.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is still the same.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:07.560,00:04:08.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is the same.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:08.940,00:04:09.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is the same.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:09.960,00:04:11.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then I'll do an end.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:12.140,00:04:14.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,Another if is if i is greater than 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:16.480,00:04:23.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,u k p plus 1 i is going to be the same thing.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:23.540,00:04:28.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,And plus u of i minus 1 divided by 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:30.520,00:04:33.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,And so that completes our one iteration.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:35.100,00:04:36.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Do we want to look at it?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:37.760,00:04:39.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, let's do that.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:40.120,00:04:42.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,u k plus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:46.260,00:04:49.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's pretty much 0, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:50.600,00:04:53.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,In fact, I'm concerned it looks exactly the same.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:53.540,00:04:54.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:54.920,00:05:01.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, oh, sorry, I forgot to add this after.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:01.920,00:05:07.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I only did this u i plus 1 and u i minus 1 part.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:07.100,00:05:08.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,I forgot to add that part.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:09.140,00:05:09.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:10.000,00:05:11.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I should do it again.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:11.160,00:05:17.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,u k plus 1 is equal to the f part.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:17.800,00:05:19.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then I'm going to do the loop.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:21.300,00:05:23.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so let's look at this again.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:23.540,00:05:32.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, right, I guess it's non-zero, but it's too small for this to show.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:34.740,00:05:36.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, it is non-zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:37.080,00:05:39.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we can see that we have to be patient, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:39.520,00:05:41.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,One iteration doesn't really do much.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:42.240,00:05:45.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's make another 100 iterations.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:45.480,00:05:49.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for k goes from 1 to 100.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:50.520,00:05:53.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's first say u is equal to u k.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:53.540,00:05:55.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we can say u is equal to u k plus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:55.540,00:06:01.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then we are going to do the for loop over the indices.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:01.040,00:06:05.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,And end.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:05.040,00:06:09.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that completes 100 iterations.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:09.040,00:06:13.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,And it seems to be getting a diverging answer.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:13.040,00:06:16.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Should we have added the f?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:18.040,00:06:21.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, yes, we should have added f.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:21.040,00:06:21.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's right.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:21.540,00:06:22.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's right.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:22.040,00:06:22.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's right.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:22.540,00:06:22.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's right.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:22.780,00:06:23.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's right.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:23.080,00:06:25.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,But why am I diverging here?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:25.080,00:06:27.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Da, da, da, da.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:27.080,00:06:29.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Plus 1, minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:31.080,00:06:42.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so let's start with u is equal to 0s and 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:42.080,00:06:46.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for k goes from the loop.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:46.080,00:06:51.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So u k p plus 1 is going to be.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:51.080,00:06:52.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Uh.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:53.080,00:07:01.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this should be equal to f.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:01.080,00:07:04.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or dx.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:04.080,00:07:08.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Uh.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:08.080,00:07:09.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:09.080,00:07:13.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think I had one of these sentences before.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:13.080,00:07:14.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:14.080,00:07:15.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is equal to.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:15.080,00:07:17.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Uh.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:17.080,00:07:19.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Minus dx squared divided by 2 times f.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:19.080,00:07:20.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Uh.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:20.080,00:07:21.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Uh.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:21.080,00:07:24.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Divided by 2 times f.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:24.080,00:07:28.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then I'm going to go through the for loop.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:28.080,00:07:32.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for i goes from 1 to n.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:32.080,00:07:38.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,If i is less than k, u is added.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:38.080,00:07:41.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if it's greater than 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:41.080,00:07:44.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that is good.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:44.080,00:07:45.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:45.080,00:07:49.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,And at the end, I want to say u is equal to u k plus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:49.080,00:07:50.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Uh.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:50.080,00:07:51.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:51.080,00:07:52.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:52.080,00:07:58.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this time I did 100 loops of the Jacobi iteration.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:58.080,00:08:01.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's plot it to see what I get.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:01.080,00:08:10.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this now looks a lot better as the solution to the Poisson's equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:10.080,00:08:11.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:11.080,00:08:12.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:12.080,00:08:16.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So just to compare, let's figure out.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:16.080,00:08:17.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Uh.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:17.080,00:08:18.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:18.080,00:08:20.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's look at the analytical solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:20.080,00:08:21.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,The true solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:21.080,00:08:24.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's look at the residual to see how much the residual is.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:24.080,00:08:27.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the residual would be equal to.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:27.080,00:08:29.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Um.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:29.080,00:08:30.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Would be equal to.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:30.080,00:08:32.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let me see.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:32.080,00:08:34.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,The f.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:34.080,00:08:36.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Minus.

Dialogue: 0,00:08:37.080,00:08:38.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:38.080,00:08:42.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the residual would be equal to f.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:42.080,00:08:45.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's do that first.

Dialogue: 0,00:08:51.080,00:08:52.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the residual is going to be 3.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:52.080,00:08:53.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the residual would be equal to.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:53.080,00:08:54.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Uh.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:54.080,00:08:55.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Uh.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:55.080,00:08:56.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Uh.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:56.080,00:08:57.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because we have already had the residual.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:57.080,00:08:58.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Uh.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:58.080,00:08:59.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:59.080,00:09:00.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:00.080,00:09:01.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So just like the derivative of the residual.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:01.080,00:09:02.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,We're going to find out.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:02.080,00:09:03.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,We're going to find out.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:03.080,00:09:04.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,The residual.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:04.080,00:09:05.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,If u is equal to.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:05.080,00:09:06.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:06.080,00:09:07.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,If u is equal to 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:07.080,00:09:08.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,R i.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:08.080,00:09:09.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is going to be ri.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:09.080,00:09:10.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Uh.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:10.080,00:09:11.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Minus.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:11.080,00:09:12.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,This.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:12.080,00:09:13.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,u of.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:13.080,00:09:14.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,I minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:14.080,00:09:15.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Divided by delta.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:15.080,00:09:16.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,X squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:16.080,00:09:17.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:17.080,00:09:33.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,all right if I is less than n our eye is going to be our eye divided by minus UI
Dialogue: 0,00:09:33.640,00:09:41.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,plus 1 divided by Delta x squared and no matter what I is our eye needs to be
Dialogue: 0,00:09:41.320,00:09:49.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,added with the diagonal term so I'm looking at the right hand side minus the left hand side so
Dialogue: 0,00:09:49.060,00:10:04.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,we have a plus 2 times UI divided by Delta x squared so here is my R my R looks like point
Dialogue: 0,00:10:04.300,00:10:10.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,zero point something so we see that it is not very small yet
Dialogue: 0,00:10:11.320,00:10:18.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,right so so remember if we have a zero solution U my R would be simply F which
Dialogue: 0,00:10:18.640,00:10:24.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,is our all ones so after a hundred iterations we see that the residual has
Dialogue: 0,00:10:24.980,00:10:32.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,reduced from the magnitude of F which is equal to 1 to something like point 2 so
Dialogue: 0,00:10:32.980,00:10:38.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,it has reduced a lot but not quite yet what does that mean we need to increase
Dialogue: 0,00:10:38.200,00:10:41.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,K so let's
Dialogue: 0,00:10:41.320,00:10:49.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,do another thousand iterations okay and we are going to look up our history for
Dialogue: 0,00:10:49.360,00:11:01.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,what we had have done before so from here to here now we have done another
Dialogue: 0,00:11:01.780,00:11:10.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,thousand iterations let's hold on and the plot the U again
Dialogue: 0,00:11:11.320,00:11:17.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,so the new one is the red solution now we have seen that the blue solution
Dialogue: 0,00:11:17.100,00:11:22.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,although it qualitatively approximates the solution it's the magnitude is not
Dialogue: 0,00:11:22.780,00:11:28.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,that right yet so so the red solution has gone even lower all right so let's
Dialogue: 0,00:11:28.360,00:11:34.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,figure out what is the residual now so again let's use what we let's try to use
Dialogue: 0,00:11:34.420,00:11:41.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,our history R is equal to for I goes from 1 to n
Dialogue: 0,00:11:41.320,00:11:53.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,so the computation of R and it over here all right so with another thousand
Dialogue: 0,00:11:53.140,00:12:00.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,iterations we get something much better right so all the other residuals are 10
Dialogue: 0,00:12:00.820,00:12:10.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,to the minus 9 okay so so that means the red solution should be pretty much the
Dialogue: 0,00:12:10.300,00:12:11.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,analytical solution
Dialogue: 0,00:12:11.320,00:12:15.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,you shouldn't we shouldn't find a difference between them so let's
Dialogue: 0,00:12:15.680,00:12:19.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,confirm that so we are going to construct the matrix now explicitly
Dialogue: 0,00:12:19.600,00:12:28.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,right so a is going to be minus 2 times identity of n divided by Delta x square
Dialogue: 0,00:12:28.840,00:12:40.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,AZ equal to a plus diagonal of 1 and minus 1 1 and I'll shift it up to 1 by 1
Dialogue: 0,00:12:40.360,00:12:41.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then we have the red solution which is the negative integral of the red solution
Dialogue: 0,00:12:41.320,00:12:48.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I'll add another lower diagonal entry so I'm going to say you exact is
Dialogue: 0,00:12:48.040,00:12:59.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,equal to a backslash F now I'm allowed to use matrix solve oh yes thanks so I
Dialogue: 0,00:12:59.760,00:13:10.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,will do this and divide by Delta x square okay now I'm supposed to be right
Dialogue: 0,00:13:10.880,00:13:17.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,okay thanks for her thanks for pointing out the buck so you exact is equal to a
Dialogue: 0,00:13:17.640,00:13:27.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,backslash F and let's hold on again and plot you exact by let's do diamonds okay
Dialogue: 0,00:13:27.200,00:13:34.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,and what do we have okay we have it's very hard to see but we have the
Dialogue: 0,00:13:34.820,00:13:39.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,diamonds overlapping with circles I can see it
Dialogue: 0,00:13:39.860,00:13:40.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,okay
Dialogue: 0,00:13:40.880,00:13:47.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,yeah so so basically we get pretty much the same solution as these Jacobi
Dialogue: 0,00:13:47.000,00:13:54.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,iteration after a thousand iterations all right any questions on these
