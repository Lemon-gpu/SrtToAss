Dialogue: 0,00:00:07.640,00:00:15.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,advection equation but an advection diffusion equation exactly so why why is
Dialogue: 0,00:00:15.540,00:00:23.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,it the case let's go back to our numerical scheme and look at when we
Dialogue: 0,00:00:23.280,00:00:29.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,discretize this equation using this way we know it is a consistent
Dialogue: 0,00:00:29.600,00:00:34.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,discretization to the equation we want to discretize and consistent means as
Dialogue: 0,00:00:34.520,00:00:40.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Delta X goes to zero the the error the error in this discretization in this
Dialogue: 0,00:00:40.560,00:00:45.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,approximation goes to zero in first order this particular case but it turns
Dialogue: 0,00:00:45.780,00:00:52.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,out the same discretization may be an even better approximation to an advection
Dialogue: 0,00:00:52.560,00:00:53.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,diffusion equation
Dialogue: 0,00:00:53.280,00:01:00.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,which makes the behavior of the code like that so let's look a little bit
Dialogue: 0,00:01:00.180,00:01:07.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,into actually is that the case how do we figure out how do you think we figure out
Dialogue: 0,00:01:07.160,00:01:15.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,when we look at an accuracy of a scheme what do we do
Dialogue: 0,00:01:15.680,00:01:23.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Taylor series exactly okay so the only non-trivial Taylor series is this one
Dialogue: 0,00:01:23.040,00:01:23.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Taylor series exactly okay so the only non-trivial Taylor series is this one
Dialogue: 0,00:01:23.280,00:01:30.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,right so that's an easy case ui minus 1 is equal to ui which is you are which is
Dialogue: 0,00:01:30.940,00:01:37.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,delta x away minus delta x times ui prime so that's a shorthand for first
Dialogue: 0,00:01:37.260,00:01:47.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,derivative plus Delta x square over 2 ui double prime minus Delta x cube over 6
Dialogue: 0,00:01:47.700,00:01:53.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,ui triple prime etc right so I should just
Dialogue: 0,00:01:53.120,00:01:58.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,wrong addition salty unfiltered just a right all tidak top of just uh right o
Dialogue: 0,00:01:58.820,00:02:03.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,delta x to the fourth or here that means the rest of the terms the case at least
Dialogue: 0,00:02:03.720,00:02:07.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,as fast as Delta X to the fourth now we gave 아주 to use to find out what the

Dialogue: 0,00:02:12.360,00:02:16.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,right so we have this term we have minus delta x to the fourth over here that
Dialogue: 0,00:02:16.940,00:02:17.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,means the rest must be case at least as fast as data x to the fourth now with
Dialogue: 0,00:02:17.980,00:02:22.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,beginners along the tutorial you're
Dialogue: 0,00:02:23.120,00:02:33.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,x ui prime plus delta x prime ui double prime minus delta x cube over 6 ui
Dialogue: 0,00:02:33.320,00:02:41.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,triple prime I'll just ignore the rest so so because O Delta x fourth divided
Dialogue: 0,00:02:41.600,00:02:47.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,by Delta X how can I write this as O something so if I divide O Delta x
Dialogue: 0,00:02:47.600,00:02:57.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,fourth by Delta X it's gonna be Delta x cube right because if this is a term
Dialogue: 0,00:02:57.260,00:03:02.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,that decays as Delta x to the fourth if I divide that term by Delta x one
Dialogue: 0,00:03:02.500,00:03:10.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,Delta x cancels I get Delta x cube okay this is equal to 0 so now we look at
Dialogue: 0,00:03:10.160,00:03:17.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,this equation and factor out this Delta x oh we have a minus on the whole thing
Dialogue: 0,00:03:17.120,00:03:17.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,okay
Dialogue: 0,00:03:17.600,00:03:22.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,we have a minus on the whole thing because it's minus okay plus u Delta x
Dialogue: 0,00:03:22.760,00:03:32.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,Delta x cancels we get our dui DX let me write as partial because now we are back
Dialogue: 0,00:03:32.180,00:03:38.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,with the spatial derivatives so that's that's the term that approximates this
Dialogue: 0,00:03:38.380,00:03:46.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,equation but then we look at the next term what is it it's a minus Delta x over
Dialogue: 0,00:03:46.400,00:03:47.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,2
Dialogue: 0,00:03:47.120,00:03:58.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,of big U times partial square u partial x square right we also have a term plus
Dialogue: 0,00:03:58.220,00:04:09.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Delta x square over 6 u partial cube ui partial x cube that is equal to Delta x
Dialogue: 0,00:04:09.200,00:04:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,cube very high order so this term is like it's very small when our Delta x is 2 pi over 100
Dialogue: 0,00:04:16.000,00:04:16.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,so this term is like it's very small when our Delta x is 2 pi over 100
Dialogue: 0,00:04:17.120,00:04:25.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this discretization we are using is actually an better approximation so so
Dialogue: 0,00:04:25.260,00:04:29.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,this term is also small let's not let's ignore this term for now it's a better
Dialogue: 0,00:04:29.240,00:04:34.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,approximation to this equation which if you move this term to the right-hand side
Dialogue: 0,00:04:34.040,00:04:41.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's a diffusion term what's interesting is that it's a diffusion term so so let's
Dialogue: 0,00:04:41.900,00:04:42.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,see
Dialogue: 0,00:04:42.420,00:04:46.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,this is the diffusion
Dialogue: 0,00:04:46.100,00:04:46.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,üll
Dialogue: 0,00:04:46.180,00:04:46.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,byочку
Dialogue: 0,00:04:46.880,00:04:52.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,right or some people call it dissipation
Dialogue: 0,00:04:52.880,00:04:58.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,because it dissipates like the peak of
Dialogue: 0,00:04:58.380,00:05:04.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,any wave signals so this term is
Dialogue: 0,00:05:04.400,00:05:08.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,proportional to delta x which means if
Dialogue: 0,00:05:08.040,00:05:09.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,you have a big delta x this term is
Dialogue: 0,00:05:09.920,00:05:12.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,stronger if you have a small delta x this
Dialogue: 0,00:05:12.380,00:05:18.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,term is weaker right so let's test it to
Dialogue: 0,00:05:18.920,00:05:21.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,see if that is the case so here we used
Dialogue: 0,00:05:21.860,00:05:26.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,n equal to a hundred if you use n equal
Dialogue: 0,00:05:26.180,00:05:29.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,to 200 the dissipation is going to be
Dialogue: 0,00:05:29.720,00:05:31.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,half as strong
Dialogue: 0,00:05:31.760,00:05:40.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,let's see if that is the case so now my
Dialogue: 0,00:05:40.100,00:05:42.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,I want to say my x is equal to
Dialogue: 0,00:05:42.360,00:05:49.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,0 to 199 divided by 200 and the rest I
Dialogue: 0,00:05:49.500,00:05:53.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,think I'll just do the same u0 is the
Dialogue: 0,00:05:53.400,00:05:56.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,same I would do od45 the same now it
Dialogue: 0,00:05:56.900,00:05:59.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,discretizes a time domain using 400 and
Dialogue: 0,00:05:59.280,00:06:03.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,something time steps right and if you
Dialogue: 0,00:06:03.480,00:06:07.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,remember the CFL condition we derived in
Dialogue: 0,00:06:07.020,00:06:10.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,the last lecture the first order
Dialogue: 0,00:06:10.480,00:06:11.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,derivative
Dialogue: 0,00:06:11.400,00:06:12.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,delta x
Dialogue: 0,00:06:12.300,00:06:15.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,is divided by 2 delta t should also
Dialogue: 0,00:06:15.240,00:06:18.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,approximately be divided by 2 that's why
Dialogue: 0,00:06:18.420,00:06:21.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,you see slightly more than the doubled
Dialogue: 0,00:06:21.900,00:06:24.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,number of teeth
Dialogue: 0,00:06:24.060,00:06:29.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,we already held on and let's plot this
Dialogue: 0,00:06:29.940,00:06:34.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,solution not using red now but X you
Dialogue: 0,00:06:34.260,00:06:41.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,let's do it as green
Dialogue: 0,00:06:41.340,00:06:48.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,so less dissipation right so how do we
Dialogue: 0,00:06:48.540,00:06:52.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,know it's half as much dissipation let's
Dialogue: 0,00:06:52.080,00:06:56.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,solve it for twice that long let's solve
Dialogue: 0,00:06:56.340,00:06:58.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,it for full price so that these waves
Dialogue: 0,00:06:58.500,00:07:01.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,should be at back to through two times
Dialogue: 0,00:07:01.500,00:07:05.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,the domain and he's almost a double so
Dialogue: 0,00:07:05.220,00:07:09.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,so let's plot this using we already had
Dialogue: 0,00:07:09.540,00:07:11.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,blue green red
Dialogue: 0,00:07:11.180,00:07:17.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,let's do huh black hmm okay okay the
Dialogue: 0,00:07:17.660,00:07:20.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,black one is almost the same as the red
Dialogue: 0,00:07:20.900,00:07:23.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,which means the dissipation is almost
Dialogue: 0,00:07:23.060,00:07:29.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,half as large right yes what change did
Dialogue: 0,00:07:29.000,00:07:31.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,you make to create the green solution
Dialogue: 0,00:07:31.940,00:07:36.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,what does change between initial red I
Dialogue: 0,00:07:36.200,00:07:38.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,doubled the number of grid points so
Dialogue: 0,00:07:38.540,00:07:41.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,this is the step this is the step is that
Dialogue: 0,00:07:41.120,00:07:45.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,of 0 to 99 divided by 100 I did 0 to 199
Dialogue: 0,00:07:45.380,00:07:48.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,divided by 200 that's the only thing I
Dialogue: 0,00:07:48.140,00:07:50.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,changed and the rest is the same this
Dialogue: 0,00:07:50.900,00:07:53.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,step this step this step is the same
