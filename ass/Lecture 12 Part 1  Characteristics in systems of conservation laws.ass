Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:07.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So last lecture we discussed characteristics of systems of conservation laws.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:08.920,00:00:15.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,It turns out if we express the system of conservation laws in its primitive forms,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:16.580,00:00:28.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,we write partial u partial x plus the derivative of the flux to the solution vector u.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:28.360,00:00:31.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now everything is a vector.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:32.080,00:00:39.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is partial f partial u is the Jacobian matrix of the flux.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:39.700,00:00:44.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because the flux is a multivariate, multidimensional function.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:46.140,00:00:50.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,If we have a system of two conservation laws, there are two u's, there are two f's.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:51.460,00:00:54.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,So df du is going to be a two by two matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:55.220,00:00:55.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:56.720,00:00:58.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have this matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:58.360,00:01:02.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,Dot with the gradient of u.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:06.200,00:01:12.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is going to be equal to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:13.660,00:01:24.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if we perform eigenvalue analysis of that matrix, we get the characteristic speeds.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:29.360,00:01:30.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,And thebeing igual to right.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:32.480,00:01:38.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,As opposed to scalar conservation laws where- in which there is a single characteristic.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:39.200,00:01:48.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,In a system of conservation laws, there are multiple characteristics usually corresponding to the dimension or of that matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:49.540,00:01:56.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,If we draw t in the y axis and x in the x axis in a scalar conservation law,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:56.780,00:02:05.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,the characteristics determine the slope of the line on which the solutions are constant.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:06.980,00:02:12.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,But for system of conservation laws, for example, in shallow water equation,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:12.300,00:02:16.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,we derived two characteristic lines.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:18.560,00:02:25.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,And on each characteristic line, a particular linear combination of the solution is preserved.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:26.780,00:02:31.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that particular linear combination actually does not stay constant.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:32.520,00:02:36.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,It doesn't stay, the linear combination coefficients of the solution doesn't stay constant.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:37.820,00:02:40.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,It only stays constant for linear equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:40.760,00:02:47.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,Whenever we have a nonlinear equation, dF du changes as the solution u changes.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:48.840,00:02:56.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,Therefore, the characteristic speeds changes and the eigenvectors of the matrix changes as the solution evolves.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:56.780,00:03:03.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,So along that line, even along that single characteristic line,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:03.860,00:03:08.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,we no longer have a constant linear combination.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:09.120,00:03:11.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,The linear combination itself actually changes.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:13.080,00:03:19.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,And also, the line, the characteristic lines, at every point, we can compute its speed.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:19.700,00:03:22.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,But the speed is no longer going to be staying constant.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:23.880,00:03:26.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because the solution no longer stays constant.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:26.780,00:03:28.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:28.780,00:03:33.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,Only particular linear combination of the solution stays constant for a small range.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:33.100,00:03:35.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then the linear combination itself changes.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:35.500,00:03:38.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,And everything, the solution is going to change.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:38.400,00:03:46.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,So these characteristics, they, first of all, they are going to overlap each other because there are two characteristics.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:46.400,00:03:48.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:48.400,00:03:53.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,And also, they may curve even in smooth regions of the space.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:53.880,00:03:55.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,And,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:56.780,00:04:00.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,because the linear combination, they change its value,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:00.780,00:04:09.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,if you make a small perturbation here, the small perturbation is going to propagate not only according to the characteristic speeds,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:09.780,00:04:18.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,but also, they are going to influence every solution that is bounded by these two characteristic lines.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:18.780,00:04:25.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,The region of influence of any small perturbation is going to be like a cone.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:25.780,00:04:26.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:26.780,00:04:27.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,The region of influence of any small perturbation is going to be like a cone.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:27.780,00:04:28.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:28.780,00:04:42.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because this curve, we are going to have to take the
Dialogue: 0,00:04:42.720,00:04:44.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,portion that goes from E to 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:44.460,00:04:46.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:46.560,00:04:49.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So E to 1 is equal to E.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:50.780,00:04:51.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:51.780,00:04:53.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because of the Hmmmm.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:53.240,00:04:54.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,In this case, this Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:54.780,00:04:55.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,Correct.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:55.780,00:05:05.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,flow plus and minus square root of gh. What I was drawing corresponds to the
Dialogue: 0,00:05:05.600,00:05:12.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,situation where the absolute value of u is smaller than square root of gh and the
Dialogue: 0,00:05:12.340,00:05:17.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,other situation is when the absolute value of u exceeds square root of gh.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:17.740,00:05:24.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then both characteristics are going in one direction. If we make a small
Dialogue: 0,00:05:24.460,00:05:29.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,perturbation here, the region of influence of the perturbation is going to
Dialogue: 0,00:05:29.200,00:05:36.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,be a cone like that, which means something interesting. That is, if you
Dialogue: 0,00:05:36.580,00:05:43.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,look at a spatial point where x is smaller than the location of the
Dialogue: 0,00:05:43.180,00:05:51.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,perturbation, that spatial point has absolutely no influence by the small
Dialogue: 0,00:05:51.640,00:05:53.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,perturbation.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:53.500,00:05:56.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,No matter how long you go ahead in time.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:57.100,00:06:04.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is a supersonic situation where if you fly a supersonic airplane,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:04.420,00:06:11.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,the region of space ahead of you is never going to feel your
Dialogue: 0,00:06:11.380,00:06:12.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,influence.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:12.520,00:06:18.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,The only influence you have is on the space behind you.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:18.700,00:06:23.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's why you create shock waves. The shock wave is
Dialogue: 0,00:06:23.500,00:06:29.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,because before the shock wave hits you, the air never feels the presence of the
Dialogue: 0,00:06:29.680,00:06:37.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,airplane. Only after the shock wave sweeps through that point, the air
Dialogue: 0,00:06:37.720,00:06:43.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,feels the presence. This is the supersonic situation over here.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:43.420,00:06:51.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright, so now given these characteristics, we can now draw a new
Dialogue: 0,00:06:51.160,00:06:51.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:51.660,00:06:52.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we can draw a new equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:52.220,00:06:52.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we can draw a new equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:52.940,00:06:53.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we can draw a new equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:53.500,00:06:53.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we can draw a new equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:53.900,00:06:54.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we can draw a new equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:54.400,00:06:54.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we can draw a new equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:54.900,00:06:55.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,But as a result, we can now draw a new equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:55.400,00:07:01.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,We now start to study what is the appropriate upwind, what is the appropriate upwinding
Dialogue: 0,00:07:01.940,00:07:05.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,strategy for a system of conservation laws.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:05.260,00:07:11.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,In scalar conservation laws, we know very well what is the upwind direction because
Dialogue: 0,00:07:11.840,00:07:14.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,there is only one characteristic.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:14.940,00:07:20.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,And depending on if the characteristic species is positive or negative,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:20.240,00:07:22.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,if it's positive, we look towards the left.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:22.420,00:07:23.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,If it's negative,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:23.420,00:07:30.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,we look towards the right. Now we have multiple characteristics and in the
Dialogue: 0,00:07:30.660,00:07:35.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,supersonic regions we still know what to do, right? We still know what to do
Dialogue: 0,00:07:35.980,00:07:40.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,because there are other characteristics despite having multiple of them, the r
Dialogue: 0,00:07:40.920,00:07:47.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,goes towards the same direction. In this case if u is greater than gh we should
Dialogue: 0,00:07:47.180,00:07:53.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,all upwind towards the left. If minus u is greater than square root of gh we should
Dialogue: 0,00:07:53.260,00:07:58.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,all upwind towards the right, but in the blue case it is not obvious how to
Dialogue: 0,00:07:58.620,00:08:03.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,upwind it. It looks like depending on which characteristic are you talking
Dialogue: 0,00:08:03.620,00:08:10.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,about my upwind direction can either be left or right. How to deal with this
Dialogue: 0,00:08:10.460,00:08:16.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,situation? One very elegant way to deal with the situation where there are
Dialogue: 0,00:08:16.600,00:08:17.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,multiple characteristics is to use the upwind direction. Now the upwind direction is
Dialogue: 0,00:08:17.160,00:08:21.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,characteristics going in different directions is something is using
Dialogue: 0,00:08:21.960,00:08:28.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,something we studied before that is the equivalence of up winding scheme to
Dialogue: 0,00:08:28.560,00:08:41.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,numerical dissipation right so when we started a linear advection equation and
Dialogue: 0,00:08:41.320,00:08:50.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,discretizing the spatial operator using upwind is going to give us a equation
Dialogue: 0,00:08:50.820,00:08:57.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,that is du IDT plus in this case upwind is towards the left so you are minus ui
Dialogue: 0,00:08:57.360,00:09:04.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,minus 1 over Delta X is equal to 0 the upwind discretization although it is a
Dialogue: 0,00:09:04.740,00:09:09.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,first-order consistent discretization of the differential equation but it is
Dialogue: 0,00:09:09.080,00:09:11.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,actually a more accurate
Dialogue: 0,00:09:11.080,00:09:11.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,discretization of the differential equation but it is actually a more
Dialogue: 0,00:09:11.160,00:09:11.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,accurate
Dialogue: 0,00:09:11.300,00:09:19.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think a third order discretization of a different equation so that's so this
Dialogue: 0,00:09:19.540,00:09:25.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,is a first order discretization of the original equation but it is a higher
Dialogue: 0,00:09:25.820,00:09:36.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,order discretization of the equation with some numerical dissipation this is
Dialogue: 0,00:09:36.300,00:09:41.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,equal to Delta X times partial square u
Dialogue: 0,00:09:41.140,00:09:47.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,partial square u partial x square and this situation is the same for upwinding
Dialogue: 0,00:09:47.640,00:09:53.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,in a different direction so if we are looking at the equation that is partial
Dialogue: 0,00:09:53.520,00:10:01.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,u partial t plus any let me write C times partial u partial x equal to 0 no
Dialogue: 0,00:10:01.780,00:10:08.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,matter what the sign of C is the upwinding is going to either give you
Dialogue: 0,00:10:08.760,00:10:10.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,this scheme or
Dialogue: 0,00:10:10.980,00:10:17.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,this is going to give you the upwinding of the differential equation so if C is
Dialogue: 0,00:10:17.980,00:10:26.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,less than 0 it's going to give me du IDT plus ui plus 1 minus ui over Delta X is
Dialogue: 0,00:10:26.360,00:10:33.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,equal to 0 but no matter if we have there is a C here no matter if C is
Dialogue: 0,00:10:33.600,00:10:40.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,greater than 0 which we get the green case or C is less than 0 we get the blue case the upwind
Dialogue: 0,00:10:40.820,00:10:52.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,is equal to delta x times the absolute value of C times the second derivative
Dialogue: 0,00:10:52.940,00:11:01.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,of X of you upwinding no matter left or right is going to introduce a numerical
Dialogue: 0,00:11:01.640,00:11:06.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,dissipation proportional to the grid size delta x and to the absolute value
Dialogue: 0,00:11:06.760,00:11:09.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,of the characteristics characteristic speed
Dialogue: 0,00:11:10.820,00:11:18.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,so that gives us motivation that if we have multiple characteristics a good way
Dialogue: 0,00:11:18.980,00:11:24.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,to achieve the same effect of upwinding is by introducing a numerical
Dialogue: 0,00:11:24.800,00:11:33.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,dissipation that is proportional to Delta X and also that is big enough for
Dialogue: 0,00:11:33.380,00:11:39.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,the fastest characteristics in the system of equations
