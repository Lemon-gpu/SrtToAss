Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.880,00:00:02.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's see another equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:02.280,00:00:06.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's say we want to solve the Helmholtz equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:06.460,00:00:08.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is the equation we want to solve.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:08.340,00:00:15.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what we do next is, OK, what's the boundary condition, and then what is the template?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:15.040,00:00:16.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now this is the template.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:16.400,00:00:18.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now we just compare, OK?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:18.040,00:00:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,We're trying to fit this template with the other equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:22.000,00:00:24.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,What do we have?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:24.780,00:00:27.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,We don't have all of those terms, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:27.680,00:00:33.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,And all we have now is C is equal to the same thing.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:33.120,00:00:44.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then K, the wave number, we have that in the absorption term.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:44.140,00:00:45.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,But that's it.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:45.420,00:00:52.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,But these are now C and A and F are the only terms that we have.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:52.340,00:00:57.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now all these things in the template are just...
Dialogue: 0,00:00:57.180,00:00:57.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,OK.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:57.680,00:01:03.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is standing for some value, but for you, depending on the physics you are trying
Dialogue: 0,00:01:03.240,00:01:06.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,to solve, they could mean one thing or another.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:06.740,00:01:11.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this C, for example, for chemical problems, it's concentration.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:11.300,00:01:14.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,For heat transfer problem, I mean, it's diffusion coefficient.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:14.540,00:01:19.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,For heat transfer problems, it's convection coefficient.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:19.720,00:01:27.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you were solving a one-dimensional elasticity stress analysis problem, that's the same thing.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:27.120,00:01:32.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is a two-dimensional elasticity stress analysis problem.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:32.620,00:01:35.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,That would be your Young's modulus.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:35.440,00:01:39.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,They can stand for different things.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:39.500,00:01:44.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,But still you just find it and fill the template.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:44.660,00:01:47.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's really something like this, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:47.640,00:01:51.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,You have things you want to fit in into a template and you're like, oh, where do I fit
Dialogue: 0,00:01:51.960,00:01:53.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,in this?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:53.620,00:01:55.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Put this here.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:55.240,00:01:56.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Put this here.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:56.280,00:01:57.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,like it might not fit.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:57.840,00:01:59.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So how can now we do this?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:06.620,00:02:08.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, so for example, forget that we're working with
Dialogue: 0,00:02:08.900,00:02:09.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:09.380,00:02:13.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,I just want to fit this circle and find them which are
Dialogue: 0,00:02:13.700,00:02:18.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,upside-down rectangular into those open areas.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:18.820,00:02:20.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,You need to cut, exactly.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:20.260,00:02:21.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you need to cut.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:21.800,00:02:24.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is for the cutting.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:24.920,00:02:27.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you need to cut.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:27.320,00:02:28.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,This will fit in.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:28.360,00:02:33.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,But the other ones, you need to cut them and modify them.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:33.700,00:02:37.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's see an equation where we have to do this.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:37.280,00:02:40.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,We want to do, let's say, Voxel's equation for finance.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:40.900,00:02:44.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, this is the equation that we want to solve.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:44.280,00:02:46.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then we will compare it with a template.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:46.720,00:02:48.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is the template that we have.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:48.840,00:02:52.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, we can easily see that we don't have those terms.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:52.840,00:02:54.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,We don't have the math terms.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:54.920,00:02:58.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,We don't have a source term.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:58.000,00:03:00.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,dA is 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:00.440,00:03:07.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, what is the problem with using C is equal to half sigma
Dialogue: 0,00:03:07.500,00:03:10.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,squared x squared?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:10.260,00:03:15.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So C looks like it could be half sigma squared x squared,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:15.120,00:03:16.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:16.540,00:03:17.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Beneficial for that.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:23.160,00:03:23.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,For x, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:23.900,00:03:24.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,They're going to have a . . .
Dialogue: 0,00:03:24.920,00:03:29.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what's the derivative with respect to x out of sigma squared x squared?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:29.520,00:03:32.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because it's going to be inside the divergence.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:32.440,00:03:35.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So when that happens, what can I do?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:35.540,00:03:37.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,OK, I'm going to do this.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:37.600,00:03:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,But then, since I have this extra derivative, I will move it, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:42.000,00:03:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,This term, sigma squared x, that comes out of this term here, next to last.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:50.000,00:03:52.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,That comes out of the .
Dialogue: 0,00:03:52.060,00:03:53.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I will just move it and try to fit it somewhere else.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:53.000,00:03:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to move it.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:54.000,00:03:54.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm going to move it.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:54.920,00:03:55.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm going to move it.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:55.920,00:03:56.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm going to move it.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:56.920,00:03:57.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,And balance it so that the end of the rate is the same.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:57.920,00:04:02.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,I convert it to a form that I understand, and it's the same format.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:02.920,00:04:04.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then there are more than one ways to do this.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:04.600,00:04:11.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,I could have put it there, or I could also have moved it to the source term.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:11.040,00:04:20.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,But in any case, it is in a format that at first doesn't look like x squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:20.320,00:04:23.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,Just try to convert it into a familiar form and fit that.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:23.720,00:04:24.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,OK.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:24.920,00:04:25.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is that clear?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:25.920,00:04:26.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is that clear?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:26.920,00:04:27.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So there was this .
Dialogue: 0,00:04:27.920,00:04:32.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,I don't know if you guys heard about this, but there was this mathematician who lost
Dialogue: 0,00:04:32.920,00:04:33.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,his job.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:33.920,00:04:38.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,And he goes to the fire department to get a job.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:38.920,00:04:40.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,And he had an interview.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:40.920,00:04:46.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the first question was, assume you are working in a certain neighborhood and one
Dialogue: 0,00:04:46.920,00:04:47.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,house is on fire.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:47.920,00:04:48.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,What do you do?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:48.920,00:04:51.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,And he says, OK, I'm going to call 911.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:51.920,00:04:52.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,And until I get that number, I'm going to call 911.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:52.920,00:04:53.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I'm going to tell 911.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:53.920,00:04:58.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,And until I get help, I'm going to find a hydrant and do what I can do in the meantime.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:58.920,00:05:01.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I'm like, okay, that's a very good answer.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:01.920,00:05:02.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Second question.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:02.920,00:05:04.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,You are working in a neighborhood.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:04.920,00:05:06.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Everything is fine, no problem.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:06.920,00:05:08.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,What do you do?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:08.920,00:05:11.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,First, I put one house on fire.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:11.920,00:05:13.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,After that, it's a social problem, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:13.920,00:05:16.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,You know how to handle that question.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:16.920,00:05:20.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So a lot of times in mathematical modeling, when things look strange,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:20.920,00:05:26.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,the first thing is can I rewrite this in a form that is familiar?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:26.920,00:05:28.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then I know how to handle it.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:28.920,00:05:32.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's how these templates work.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:32.920,00:05:39.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So when you are working with this, then you need to sometimes access the derivatives of certain quantities.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:39.920,00:05:43.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So here are some operators in console to give you derivatives.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:43.920,00:05:46.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,If the solution field was u, for example,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:46.920,00:05:50.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,then ux, uy, uz will give you special derivatives.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:50.920,00:05:53.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then you can add them.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:53.920,00:05:58.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,It will give you a second derivative, mixed derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:58.920,00:06:09.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you are on surfaces, we have this solution field uppercase T special direction variable,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:09.920,00:06:13.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,which will give you a tangential derivative on boundaries.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:13.920,00:06:19.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, that only works if you are differentiating the solution field.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:19.920,00:06:20.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,But other times,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:20.920,00:06:22.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,you want to differentiate other quantities.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:22.920,00:06:25.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,For example, this would mean that for a heat transfer problem,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:25.920,00:06:29.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,these operators will work if you are differentiating temperature.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:29.920,00:06:33.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,But if you are trying to differentiate flux or another quantity, they don't work.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:33.920,00:06:38.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,But the operators which work irrespective of the quantity you are using
Dialogue: 0,00:06:38.920,00:06:45.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,are this d, quantity, comma, what you are differentiating it against with operators.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:45.920,00:06:49.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So those give you partial derivatives of any quantity with respect to x, y, z.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:49.920,00:06:54.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or r of z in a cis-emitter component.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:54.920,00:06:56.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,And time.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:56.920,00:07:00.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,In the reference manual, you can find more differentiation operators.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:00.920,00:07:04.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you will use this operator sometimes when you need access to the derivatives.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:04.920,00:07:05.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:05.920,00:07:07.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Can we get normal derivatives the same way?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:07.920,00:07:09.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is that going to happen or something?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:14.920,00:07:15.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,I have to check.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:15.920,00:07:18.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,I don't think it's available.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:18.920,00:07:20.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:20.920,00:07:30.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because mostly the way you can do is,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:30.920,00:07:34.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,the way I evaluate normal derivatives is,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:34.920,00:07:36.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,the derivative itself is available.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:36.920,00:07:41.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the unit outward normal on boundaries is also available.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:41.920,00:07:43.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you can take a dope product.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:43.920,00:07:44.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:44.920,00:07:47.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,But the tangential derivatives are important because a lot of times,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:47.920,00:07:55.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,you might want to, if you have a surface, some equation only valid on the surface.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:55.920,00:08:00.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you have surface chemistry, for example, you might want to have access to the tangential derivatives.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:00.920,00:08:06.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,But yeah, you get the derivative and you can dot multiply them with a unit outward normal.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:06.920,00:08:07.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Other questions?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:08.920,00:08:09.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is it clear so far?
