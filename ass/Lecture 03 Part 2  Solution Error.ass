Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let me write a hat just to emphasize we have a numerical solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:10.000,00:00:13.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,hat, hat, hat.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:13.000,00:00:23.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,We want to know what is the error which is u hat minus ua.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:23.000,00:00:27.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,What we know is the truncation error.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:27.000,00:00:33.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,What we know is, well we don't know exactly, but we know how it behaves.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:33.000,00:00:43.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,We know how fast it goes to zero as delta x decreases.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:43.000,00:00:45.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Actually, no.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:45.000,00:00:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Tau is equal to this, not on the numerical solution, but on the analytical solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:54.000,00:00:57.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to write a here, a here, a here.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:57.000,00:01:13.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The important thing is that the discrete operator and the continuous operator is applied to the same solution when you're looking at Taylor series analysis.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:13.000,00:01:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,All of these analyses only are true when this and this is operated on the same function as this derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:24.000,00:01:27.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,If there are different functions, it doesn't apply.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:27.000,00:01:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And they have to be analytic solution because only the analytic solution has a derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:34.000,00:01:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The discrete solutions, the ui hats, I mean they are only at discrete points.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:38.000,00:01:45.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,They don't even have a derivative, a well defined, a uniquely defined derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:45.000,00:01:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So when we do truncation error, we apply this on the analytical solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:50.000,00:01:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:52.000,00:01:55.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,But when you look at the solution error.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:55.000,00:01:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And when you.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:56.000,00:02:11.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And when you derive the evolution of the solution error by taking the analytical solution and the analytical equation and numerical solution and subtract them from each other.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:11.000,00:02:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,What you get is dui hat dt minus partial ua partial t.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:20.000,00:02:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the left hand side would be equal to something very similar to the truncation error.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:25.000,00:02:31.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,But not the truncation error.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:31.000,00:02:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's not the truncation error because the discrete operator, the finite difference operator is operated on the discrete solution, not the analytical solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:42.000,00:02:49.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the derivative, the analytical derivative is operated on the analytical operator.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:49.000,00:02:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So who remembers what we did to resolve that discrepancy?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:54.000,00:03:01.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,You summed and subtracted the same terms.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:01.000,00:03:03.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's what we get there.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:03.000,00:03:07.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Both the brain, they were subtracting and they added because.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:07.000,00:03:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Exactly.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:08.000,00:03:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I added and subtracted a term that is u analytic.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:14.000,00:03:17.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,i plus 1 plus u analytic.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:17.000,00:03:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,i minus 1 minus 2u analytic i.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:24.000,00:03:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Divided by delta x square.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:26.000,00:03:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I subtracted this term and I added the same term.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:38.000,00:03:39.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:39.000,00:03:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the term I added and subtracted which changes nothing.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:44.000,00:03:45.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:45.000,00:03:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then I copy what I have originally on this equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:54.000,00:03:58.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Also subtract derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:58.000,00:04:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now I group here.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:00.000,00:04:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I group here.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:02.000,00:04:03.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I get two terms.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:03.000,00:04:12.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,One of them, which is this term, is exactly equal to the truncation error.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:12.000,00:04:19.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this term goes like o delta x square.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:19.000,00:04:21.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The first term.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:21.000,00:04:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,They are the same operator operated on different solutions.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:25.000,00:04:31.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the difference between them is actually the discrete operator operated on what?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:31.000,00:04:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,On u hat minus u a.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:34.000,00:04:37.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Which is the error.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:37.000,00:04:45.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So here we basically derived what's called the error equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:45.000,00:04:49.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the left hand side is basically de dt.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:49.000,00:04:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,D.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:50.000,00:05:01.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,dt right this is the left hand side is equal to first of all this term is let
Dialogue: 0,00:05:01.320,00:05:19.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,me say you ei okay ei so put an i here okay is equal to ei plus 1 plus ei
Dialogue: 0,00:05:19.320,00:05:28.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,minus 1 minus 2 ei divided by Delta x squared so that's this first parenthesis
Dialogue: 0,00:05:28.780,00:05:40.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,plus tau i this is called the error equation this is how the error of our
Dialogue: 0,00:05:40.920,00:05:47.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,numerical solution evolves in time it has two terms one term is contribution
Dialogue: 0,00:05:47.340,00:05:48.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,from tau i
Dialogue: 0,00:05:49.320,00:05:58.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,the other term is a self evolution of this error okay and this is why we need
Dialogue: 0,00:05:58.980,00:06:07.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,to make sure that this discrete operator itself is stable okay it is stable in
Dialogue: 0,00:06:07.620,00:06:15.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,the sense that it has to be stable in the sense that if on the last time step
Dialogue: 0,00:06:15.680,00:06:19.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,there is a certain amount of numerical error
Dialogue: 0,00:06:19.320,00:06:24.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,if assuming we have no contribution from tau we have no contribution we have no
Dialogue: 0,00:06:24.360,00:06:28.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,truncation error even in the absence of truncation error the error should decay
Dialogue: 0,00:06:28.980,00:06:34.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,by itself at least it shouldn't amplify itself
