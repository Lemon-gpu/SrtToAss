Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:07.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,if you do Fourier series analysis to a fourth order derivative right you are
Dialogue: 0,00:00:07.440,00:00:14.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,taking ik to the fourth power what is that like
Dialogue: 0,00:00:14.520,00:00:33.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,so the first order derivative to Fourier series analysis you get a purely imaginary eigenvalue
Dialogue: 0,00:00:33.900,00:00:41.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,that that means oscillations preserving the magnitude right second order derivative you
Dialogue: 0,00:00:41.760,00:00:44.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,get minus k square that means decay
Dialogue: 0,00:00:44.520,00:00:52.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,third order derivative you get still purely imaginary but you have k cubed so it advects
Dialogue: 0,00:00:52.380,00:00:59.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,it different frequencies oscillates more differently and in in terms of advection that means different
Dialogue: 0,00:00:59.160,00:01:03.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,frequencies are advected at different speeds
Dialogue: 0,00:01:03.200,00:01:10.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,fourth order derivative you get k to the fourth and usually the sign unless you have an unstable
Dialogue: 0,00:01:10.680,00:01:13.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,scheme the sign over that k to the fourth
Dialogue: 0,00:01:13.900,00:01:14.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,the
Dialogue: 0,00:01:14.500,00:01:18.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,the error term should have a negative sign otherwise you should have you're going to
Dialogue: 0,00:01:18.640,00:01:21.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,get unstable scheme alright if you have a stable
Dialogue: 0,00:01:21.380,00:01:28.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,scheme you should have minus k to the fourth as you eigenvalue
Dialogue: 0,00:01:28.160,00:01:37.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,what is that what does that dissipation that's right and it dissipates your higher
Dialogue: 0,00:01:37.200,00:01:44.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,frequency even faster than than k square okay but the good thing is that term is you should
Dialogue: 0,00:01:44.500,00:01:52.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,scales with Delta X cubed. So with enough grid you only see the effect of that
Dialogue: 0,00:01:52.660,00:02:00.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,dissipation on very high weight numbers. That's why it's more accurate.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:00.220,00:02:01.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:01.220,00:02:16.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,If we try upwinding on this unit instead of trying it on the bump, would we have dissipation
Dialogue: 0,00:02:16.360,00:02:20.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,for higher terms which are at the corners of that shape?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:20.540,00:02:28.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Are you asking if I use the first order upwinding on this one, what do I get? Let's try it.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:28.220,00:02:29.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:29.220,00:02:30.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:30.220,00:02:47.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's do K because it looks more obvious. That. So the height, yeah, basically dissipates
Dialogue: 0,00:02:47.720,00:02:52.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,things away. All right. Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:52.720,00:02:58.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,But all those terms, they're still going to be the third order and also in this
Dialogue: 0,00:02:58.220,00:02:59.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,scheme as well.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:59.220,00:03:00.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's just far less pronounced.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:00.220,00:03:01.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:01.220,00:03:02.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,The middle one is againол
Dialogue: 0,00:03:02.820,00:03:03.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:03.720,00:03:18.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm going to measure something else, and then
Dialogue: 0,00:03:18.540,00:03:23.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,you can hedge in some ways depending on you're...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:23.220,00:03:24.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:24.220,00:03:25.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:25.300,00:03:27.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, see what I'm trying to do here, which is the fifth-placeかった-type fraternal
Dialogue: 0,00:03:27.220,00:03:28.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Disseduction.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:28.220,00:03:29.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's fine, affecting the rest of the paid.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:29.220,00:03:31.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,when you have higher wave numbers.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:31.220,00:03:36.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you almost don't see that in the black solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:36.220,00:03:38.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you really, really zoom in,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:38.220,00:03:41.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,the black solution is not going to be symmetric.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:41.220,00:03:43.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right, it has slight asymmetry,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:43.220,00:03:47.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,but it's very hard to spot.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:47.220,00:03:49.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you have an analytical solution
Dialogue: 0,00:03:49.220,00:03:52.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,of a black-trim dissipation equation,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:52.220,00:03:57.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,the black wave should be completely symmetric.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:57.220,00:04:01.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right, any other questions?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:11.220,00:04:15.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Are there formulations that avoid all of these errors?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:24.220,00:04:27.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,It'll be ideal if you can find the scheme
Dialogue: 0,00:04:27.220,00:04:31.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,that avoids any kind of errors.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:31.220,00:04:37.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,But like, unless for very simple equations,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:37.220,00:04:39.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,there is going to be numerical errors.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:39.220,00:04:41.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the dissipation and dispersion error
Dialogue: 0,00:04:41.220,00:04:45.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,is just a way we classify different types of errors.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:45.220,00:04:47.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,So dissipation error,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:47.220,00:04:53.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,both acts a lot stronger on higher wave numbers.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:53.220,00:04:56.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's just dissipation error,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:56.220,00:04:59.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,but the error artificially damps down,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:59.220,00:05:02.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,removes these higher wave number components.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:02.220,00:05:04.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,And dispersion error,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:04.220,00:05:06.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,it doesn't remove them,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:06.220,00:05:09.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,but put them in the wrong place.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:09.220,00:05:11.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's kind of, in general,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:11.220,00:05:17.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,how we classify the effect of these numerical errors.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:17.220,00:05:18.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:18.220,00:05:21.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you switch back to the analytic derivation,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:21.220,00:05:23.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,I had a question about what happened
Dialogue: 0,00:05:23.220,00:05:24.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,to one of the terms.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:24.220,00:05:25.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:26.220,00:05:29.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Can you scroll up slightly,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:29.220,00:05:31.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,going from...
Dialogue: 0,00:05:34.220,00:05:35.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:35.220,00:05:37.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Sorry, I misread the notes.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:39.220,00:05:40.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Thank you.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:40.220,00:05:41.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:42.220,00:05:44.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any other questions?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:44.220,00:05:45.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,No?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:45.220,00:05:46.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
