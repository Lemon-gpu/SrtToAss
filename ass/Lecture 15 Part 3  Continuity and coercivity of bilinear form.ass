Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:10.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,We also need conditions for A. Okay, so first of all, A also has to be
Dialogue: 0,00:00:10.460,00:00:26.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,continuous in a very similar way. So A, so continuity of A, u and v. So continuity
Dialogue: 0,00:00:26.520,00:00:32.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,of a linear functional, let's go back to here, says that there has to be a constant,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:33.060,00:00:38.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,finite constant, for which the value of the linear functional has to be less or equal to
Dialogue: 0,00:00:38.020,00:00:48.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,the norm. So again, this is not in xv because L of v is to a field. So L of v has to be less than
Dialogue: 0,00:00:48.220,00:00:56.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,the constant times the norm of that function. So continuity of this is very similar. So A of u and
Dialogue: 0,00:00:56.080,00:00:56.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,v.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:56.520,00:01:02.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,The norm of this, or absolute value, let's stick to the real number. So absolute value of this
Dialogue: 0,00:01:02.620,00:01:11.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,is less or equal to c. So there exists a c such that this has to be less or equal to c
Dialogue: 0,00:01:11.480,00:01:25.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,times the norm of u times the norm of v for all u and v. Okay, now because it's bilinear,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:25.380,00:01:26.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,we need to
Dialogue: 0,00:01:26.520,00:01:33.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,multiply. So the right-hand side, the bound is also bilinear. It's also bilinear in the sense that
Dialogue: 0,00:01:33.680,00:01:39.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's not exactly bilinear. So the right-hand side is also a product of its ingredients. So if you
Dialogue: 0,00:01:39.960,00:01:47.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,scale u by a number, by 2, the bound is also scaled by 2. If you scale v by 2, the bound is
Dialogue: 0,00:01:47.440,00:01:55.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,also scaled by 2, right? Okay, so the continuity is easy. In order for finite element to be well
Dialogue: 0,00:01:55.760,00:01:56.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,posed, we also need to multiply the number of elements. So if you scale u by 2, the number of
Dialogue: 0,00:01:56.500,00:01:57.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,elements must be well-pumped and equal to the number of elements. So if you scale u by 2, the number of
Dialogue: 0,00:01:57.000,00:01:57.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,elements must be well-pumped and equal to the number of elements. And we also need this
Dialogue: 0,00:01:57.380,00:02:03.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,coercivity. That's a word I haven't seen anywhere else, but like this is what's called about a
Dialogue: 0,00:02:03.740,00:02:20.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,bilinear functional. So coercivity is that there also exists a number b that is finite. So this
Dialogue: 0,00:02:20.600,00:02:26.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,is only has to be finite, right? The b has to be greater, strictly greater than zero. And
Dialogue: 0,00:02:26.340,00:02:26.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,that's the right-hand side. So we need this coercivity. So we need this coercivity. So we need this
Dialogue: 0,00:02:26.460,00:02:32.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,and also finite, such that the other way is true.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:32.600,00:02:42.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,So A of u and u, so that means if I plug in the same function on these two linear functionals,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:42.600,00:02:50.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,on these two arguments of the bilinear form, this has to be greater or equal to this b
Dialogue: 0,00:02:50.240,00:03:00.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,times the norm of u squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:00.080,00:03:02.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if A...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:02.380,00:03:11.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,One way to think of a bilinear form is that A is like an infinite dimensional matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:11.840,00:03:17.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So A operated on u and v is like u transpose times that infinite dimensional matrix times
Dialogue: 0,00:03:17.240,00:03:18.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,v.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:18.240,00:03:19.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean, a matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:19.240,00:03:20.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to do this.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:20.240,00:03:26.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,So a matrix is a bilinear function or a bilinear form in a finite dimensional space, finite
Dialogue: 0,00:03:26.820,00:03:28.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,dimensional linear space.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:28.180,00:03:36.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,You have a matrix A and you have v transpose times A times v, you get a number, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:36.260,00:03:46.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this continuity is really for finite dimensional matrix, continuity is automatically satisfied.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:46.520,00:03:50.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,For any finite dimensional space, you don't have the problem about continuity.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:50.240,00:03:54.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,So but co-versivity in a finite dimensional sense is basically saying that the matrix
Dialogue: 0,00:03:54.880,00:03:57.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,is positive definite.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:57.360,00:03:59.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:59.440,00:04:07.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,You cannot have u transpose A times u being negative or being zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:07.480,00:04:15.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the matrix has to be full rank and it's all the...
Dialogue: 0,00:04:15.480,00:04:19.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So u times A times u transpose A u has to be always positive.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:19.240,00:04:20.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:20.240,00:04:29.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So these are the two properties that needs to be satisfied for finite...
Dialogue: 0,00:04:29.200,00:04:31.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,For the weak form to be well-posed.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:31.680,00:04:41.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,And let's look at why under these conditions the weak form is well-posed.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:41.480,00:04:46.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,So well-posedness of weak form.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:46.440,00:04:47.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:47.440,00:04:48.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's look at this.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:48.440,00:04:49.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the weak form.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:49.440,00:04:49.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is the well-posedness.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:50.240,00:04:51.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:51.240,00:05:07.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,So well-posedness of the weak form is that if I have a u satisfying A of u, v equal to
Dialogue: 0,00:05:07.360,00:05:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,L of v for all the v's, then I can bound this u.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:18.000,00:05:19.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,I can bound this u because...
Dialogue: 0,00:05:19.440,00:05:29.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because v times the norm of u squared, okay, is less or equal to A of u and u.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:29.440,00:05:30.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:30.800,00:05:33.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this can be rewritten as this.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:33.080,00:05:42.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,It can be rewritten as the norm of u is less or equal to 1 over this b times A u u divided
Dialogue: 0,00:05:42.960,00:05:43.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,by the norm of u.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:43.960,00:05:45.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm just splitting the u norm squared into norm of u, norm of u here.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:45.440,00:05:46.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:46.440,00:05:47.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the normal view.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:47.440,00:05:48.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is the normal view.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:48.440,00:05:49.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is the normal view.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:49.440,00:05:50.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is the normal view.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:50.440,00:05:51.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is the normal view.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:51.440,00:05:58.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,But this splitting is interesting because if I substitute this A u u with L of v, and
Dialogue: 0,00:05:58.440,00:05:59.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,this is because...
Dialogue: 0,00:05:59.440,00:06:06.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is because of u satisfying the weak form, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:06.200,00:06:13.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,If u satisfies the weak form for any v, and that any v also include u itself, so what
Dialogue: 0,00:06:13.680,00:06:17.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm having is L of u divided by the norm of u.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:17.800,00:06:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And now what is this?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:25.000,00:06:28.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is like the...
Dialogue: 0,00:06:28.080,00:06:33.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is what appears in the definition of the norm of the linear functional.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:33.240,00:06:39.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,This appears in the definition of this linear functional being bounded, or being continuous.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:39.240,00:06:43.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is less or equal to 1 over b times the norm of this L.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:43.800,00:06:44.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:44.800,00:06:45.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:45.800,00:06:46.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,So...
Dialogue: 0,00:06:46.800,00:06:50.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now this is...
Dialogue: 0,00:06:50.200,00:06:57.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,The result is saying that if we have a u that satisfies the weak form, then the norm of
Dialogue: 0,00:06:57.360,00:07:02.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,the solution is less or equal to the norm of the right-hand side, the linear functional,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:02.200,00:07:10.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,divided by the coercivity coefficient of the bilinear form.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:10.080,00:07:13.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now it also guarantees...
Dialogue: 0,00:07:13.080,00:07:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,This result also guarantees the solution is unique.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:14.000,00:07:15.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:15.000,00:07:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So...
Dialogue: 0,00:07:16.000,00:07:17.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The solution is unique.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:17.000,00:07:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Why is the solution unique?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:18.000,00:07:25.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,The solution is unique because if I have u1 and u2 satisfying the same weak form, auv

Dialogue: 0,00:09:14.060,00:09:15.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,Coercivity is a property.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:15.460,00:09:24.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in order for you to define coercivity, you need a to be a function of two functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:24.320,00:09:26.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,It has to be a bilinear form.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:27.940,00:09:33.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the continuity can be defined on both bilinear form and linear functional.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:35.080,00:09:41.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the zero functional on the right-hand side is a linear functional.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:42.040,00:09:44.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,You can define continuity, but you can't define coercivity.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:44.780,00:09:49.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,Coercivity is satisfied by this A, the bilinear form.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:50.100,00:09:50.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:52.200,00:09:53.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,What is definition of L?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:53.780,00:10:00.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,Definition of L is the linear functional in the weak form of the differential equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:05.880,00:10:06.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:06.960,00:10:09.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's the same as L of V, L of V.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:09.020,00:10:14.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's just saying that we have defined the norm of this L.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:14.780,00:10:16.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,L is a map.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:16.780,00:10:21.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,L is a map from a function space to real numbers.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:22.620,00:10:22.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:23.220,00:10:33.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,So here we define the norm of that map to be the maximum ratio between L of V and the norm of V.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:33.660,00:10:35.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,For any possible V you can choose.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:36.180,00:10:37.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,That is non-zero, of course.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:38.840,00:10:39.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:40.720,00:10:41.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:41.320,00:10:41.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:41.400,00:10:46.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,Your question is, can I have a very large B?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:46.360,00:10:47.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:47.360,00:10:49.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that I can do very small.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:49.240,00:10:49.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Very small.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:50.100,00:10:50.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:52.580,00:11:01.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,If I have a large V, if I have a large B, then even a very large perturbation on the right-hand side would give me a small perturbation on the solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:02.400,00:11:06.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,If I have a small B, then the stability is less.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:07.600,00:11:09.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,I have less stability, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:09.420,00:11:11.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,A small perturbation may make me a large.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:11.400,00:11:12.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Change in the solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:12.720,00:11:13.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, that's right.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:15.120,00:11:19.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So B really determines how stable the solution is.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:23.160,00:11:25.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, the step from here to here?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:25.660,00:11:26.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:26.560,00:11:31.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is because of U satisfying the weak form for any V.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:32.360,00:11:35.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if I replace V with U, this is also satisfied.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:35.540,00:11:35.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:36.040,00:11:39.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So U is one of the possibilities of any V.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:40.560,00:11:41.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,That means A.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:41.360,00:11:43.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,A of U, U is equal to L of U.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:44.020,00:11:45.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So A of U, U is equal to L of U.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:46.220,00:11:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The others are kept the same.
