Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:02.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's look at the Burgess equation for example.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:06.160,00:00:10.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Burgess. My speed of the shock would be equal to
Dialogue: 0,00:00:10.960,00:00:24.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,ul squared over 2 minus ur squared over 2 ul minus ur.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:24.660,00:00:34.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this only works for the Burgess equation, but if you express the difference in squares
Dialogue: 0,00:00:34.340,00:00:40.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,in terms of the summation times the difference, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:40.960,00:00:48.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, we are going to get a half of ul plus ur, ul minus ur.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:48.240,00:00:56.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,And ul minus ur, that cancels out. That gives me ul plus ur over 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:58.780,00:01:03.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, again, it only works for Burgess equation. Don't generalize this.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:03.940,00:01:09.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's that the speed of the discontinuity is equal to the average between the speed
Dialogue: 0,00:01:09.840,00:01:10.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,of the shock and the speed of the shock.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:10.940,00:01:14.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, again, if you look at the characteristics on the left and the speed of the characteristics
Dialogue: 0,00:01:14.440,00:01:17.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,on the right, okay?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:18.060,00:01:28.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, for example, again, if you look at here, the merge of the two shocks, you basically
Dialogue: 0,00:01:28.060,00:01:35.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,get the speed of the shock equal to the average between the characteristics to the left and
Dialogue: 0,00:01:35.220,00:01:37.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,the characteristics to the right.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:37.460,00:01:40.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, the characteristics to the left has a positive.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:40.940,00:01:42.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,The speed goes to the right.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:43.380,00:01:47.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,The one at the right has a negative speed almost of the same magnitude.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:47.800,00:01:49.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,The result?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:50.840,00:01:54.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,The discontinuity moving at zero speed, going vertical.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:56.160,00:01:56.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:02.960,00:02:04.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, why is it curved?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:04.720,00:02:06.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,Why does it change slope?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:09.020,00:02:09.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:09.740,00:02:09.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:10.940,00:02:12.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:12.720,00:02:13.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,U and UR can change.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:13.960,00:02:23.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,For example, when you are at this segment, okay, UL is the same as over here, but UR
Dialogue: 0,00:02:23.540,00:02:24.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,has changed.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:24.960,00:02:31.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,In the lower part of this shock, UR is this value almost equal to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:32.920,00:02:37.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,But once you go up to here, UR has changed to this very negative region.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:38.380,00:02:40.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,That is why the shock...
Dialogue: 0,00:02:40.940,00:02:41.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Suddenly turned.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:41.940,00:02:49.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Over here, the slope of the speed of the shock is equal to the average between the speed
Dialogue: 0,00:02:49.080,00:02:52.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,on the left and a zero speed.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:52.800,00:02:57.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,While here, it is the average between a positive one and a negative one.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:57.180,00:02:59.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's how it changes speed.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:59.180,00:03:01.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:01.880,00:03:06.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,I can also manufacture cases that is...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:06.320,00:03:09.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,That have the shock turn continuously.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:09.520,00:03:10.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:10.940,00:03:13.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, how do I do that?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:13.840,00:03:18.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,How should I manufacture a case where the shock is going to turn continuously?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:18.260,00:03:20.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let me do that.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:20.800,00:03:24.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let me manufacture a shock that...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:24.340,00:03:25.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,I get a shock.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:25.760,00:03:26.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:26.760,00:03:35.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, this shock should move towards the right because both left and right has positive values.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:35.300,00:03:39.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,But let me do something like this.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:39.640,00:03:40.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:40.940,00:03:43.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, I can see the shock is going to turn.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:43.840,00:03:44.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:44.840,00:03:47.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,And see how the shock is going to turn.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:47.840,00:03:52.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Initially, I'm sure it is going to move towards the right because if you look at the solution
Dialogue: 0,00:03:52.840,00:03:59.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,on both on the left and right of the shock wave, it is positive, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:59.840,00:04:05.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,But you can see also these characteristics.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:05.840,00:04:08.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,They are less than the positive.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:08.840,00:04:09.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:09.840,00:04:16.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,They are less deep and they are going to run into the shock wave in no time.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:16.380,00:04:21.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,And as they run into the shock wave, the value immediately at the right of the shock
Dialogue: 0,00:04:21.980,00:04:25.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,wave is going to change.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:25.080,00:04:27.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,It is going to become higher or lower.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:27.740,00:04:28.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:28.740,00:04:33.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,Can you say it again?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:33.740,00:04:37.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,The top part is moving right.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:37.740,00:04:38.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:38.740,00:04:42.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,The bottom part is moving towards the left.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:42.680,00:04:43.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:43.680,00:04:46.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm just focusing on the discontinuity here.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:46.680,00:04:50.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, initially, I have this discontinuity that moves towards the right.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:50.680,00:04:57.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,But as these continuous characteristics run into the shock, the value immediately on the
Dialogue: 0,00:04:57.680,00:05:00.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,right of the curve is going to change almost continuously.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:00.680,00:05:04.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean, to the right of the shock is going to change almost continuously.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:04.680,00:05:05.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:05.680,00:05:06.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, if you zoom in into here.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:06.680,00:05:07.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:07.680,00:05:12.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, you see this one runs into the shock.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:12.620,00:05:14.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,Another one runs into the shock.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:14.620,00:05:18.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean, these characteristics go into the shock everywhere.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:18.620,00:05:23.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,As things run into the shock, the value at the right side of the shock changes.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:23.620,00:05:25.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,It decreases, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:25.620,00:05:28.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,Originally, this is almost yellow.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:28.620,00:05:30.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, it's almost blue.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:30.620,00:05:35.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,And as the value on the right of the shock changes, the value on the left side of the
Dialogue: 0,00:05:35.620,00:05:36.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,shock decreases.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:36.620,00:05:38.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,The speed of the shock should decrease.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:38.560,00:05:43.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, that's why you see this obvious curvature towards the left.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:43.560,00:05:45.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Does it make sense?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:45.560,00:05:51.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,And now, I don't know what's going to happen because the left side is also starting to
Dialogue: 0,00:05:51.560,00:05:52.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,decrease.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:52.560,00:05:57.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, I think both sides, so both value at the left and value at the right is decreasing.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:57.560,00:06:01.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,That makes the whole curve a little bit more difficult.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:01.560,00:06:05.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, I think both sides, so both value at the left and value at the right is decreasing.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:05.560,00:06:12.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,That makes the whole shock should curve towards the left pretty fast.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:12.500,00:06:18.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think pretty soon, so right now, the positive side is still a little bit higher than the
Dialogue: 0,00:06:18.500,00:06:19.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,negative side.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:19.500,00:06:24.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,It has a larger magnitude as the negative side, but pretty soon, we'll have a zero speed.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:24.500,00:06:26.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right now, it's probably have a zero speed now.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:26.500,00:06:28.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's almost vertical.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:28.500,00:06:33.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the shock is going to turn towards the left as the negative side wins over the positive
Dialogue: 0,00:06:33.500,00:06:34.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,side.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:35.560,00:06:37.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:37.560,00:06:39.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any questions?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:39.560,00:06:45.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, when we first derive the speed of the shock, how do we know there will be a shock
Dialogue: 0,00:06:45.560,00:06:48.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,when the UL and UR doesn't change?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:48.560,00:06:54.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think we assume they don't change value and then calculate the speed of the shock.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:54.560,00:06:55.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:55.560,00:07:02.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,We assumed the left and right doesn't change value over infinitesimal time step.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:02.560,00:07:03.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:03.560,00:07:04.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:04.560,00:07:05.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,And...
Dialogue: 0,00:07:05.560,00:07:08.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, the question is a very good question is what is...
Dialogue: 0,00:07:08.560,00:07:09.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Why is it appropriate to do that?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:09.560,00:07:18.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, let me stop the MATLAB and going to do some more analysis.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:18.560,00:07:23.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:23.560,00:07:24.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:24.560,00:07:27.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, let's go back to our original derivation.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:27.560,00:07:29.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, the question is a really good one.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:29.560,00:07:34.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, why is it appropriate to assume UL and UR doesn't change much over the...
Dialogue: 0,00:07:34.560,00:07:35.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,The delta T?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:35.560,00:07:44.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,The answer is it does change, but the magnitude of influence of that change to what I'm deriving
Dialogue: 0,00:07:44.560,00:07:52.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,here is at a higher order in terms of DT than what I've written down here.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:52.560,00:07:59.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, imagine UR and UL are also changing in a continuous fashion.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:59.560,00:08:03.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, UR instead of at this value, it changes.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:03.560,00:08:08.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,At this value, it increases to over here.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:08.560,00:08:13.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,UL instead of this value, it has maybe decreased to over here.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:13.560,00:08:22.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, the question is what is the contribution to the change of the integral from this part
Dialogue: 0,00:08:22.560,00:08:28.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,and this part compared to this original box I was drawing here?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:28.560,00:08:31.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:31.560,00:08:39.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, the contribution of this part and this part is on the order of DT times epsilon,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:39.560,00:08:40.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,where DT...
Dialogue: 0,00:08:40.560,00:08:46.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,The reason I said DT is the magnitude of this change is on the order of DT.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:46.560,00:08:50.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,And so, the vertical side of this box is on the order of DT.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:50.560,00:08:55.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,The horizontal side of the box is on the order of epsilon.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:55.560,00:08:59.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,The contribution to this is going to be epsilon times UL.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:59.560,00:09:00.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:00.560,00:09:05.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, this is going to be epsilon times DT over DT, which is epsilon.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:05.560,00:09:15.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is why I chose this interval, A and B, to be a very small interval around the shock.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:15.560,00:09:26.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Particularly how small I can choose it is determined by the fact that the shock cannot move outside of the interval.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:26.560,00:09:30.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, the size of epsilon should also be proportional to DT.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:30.560,00:09:41.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,That is why the contribution of this changing UL and UR to the difference is on the order of DT squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:41.560,00:09:46.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,And here, to the derivative is on the order of DT.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:46.560,00:09:50.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, when you choose DT to be small enough, this contribution can be safely ignored.
