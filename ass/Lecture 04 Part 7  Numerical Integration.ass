Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:06.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,And one of the things I asked you to do which actually has nothing to do with numerical PDE's per se
Dialogue: 0,00:00:06.480,00:00:11.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,but like is used a lot in numerical methods is I was asking you to
Dialogue: 0,00:00:12.720,00:00:14.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,look at how uniform
Dialogue: 0,00:00:15.920,00:00:21.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,the temperature is and I want to also minimize how much water you are using
Dialogue: 0,00:00:22.020,00:00:24.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the amount of water you're using is a integration
Dialogue: 0,00:00:24.960,00:00:33.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,from let's say 0 to T and by the way if you want to compute the average amount of water per unit time you would be
Dialogue: 0,00:00:33.940,00:00:38.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,dividing that by 1 over T times U of T dt
Dialogue: 0,00:00:39.920,00:00:43.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you have a function either analytical or numerical
Dialogue: 0,00:00:44.780,00:00:48.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,You can you should also be computing the integral
Dialogue: 0,00:00:48.800,00:00:53.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I want to I want to get a sense of how many people already know how to integrate
Dialogue: 0,00:00:53.380,00:00:54.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,numerically functions
Dialogue: 0,00:00:54.680,00:00:54.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,up
Dialogue: 0,00:00:54.940,00:00:56.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,, so I want to get a sense of how many people already know how to integrate numerically functions
Dialogue: 0,00:00:56.940,00:00:58.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,like that
Dialogue: 0,00:01:00.760,00:01:05.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's like half of the class so I'll say a little bit on that
Dialogue: 0,00:01:07.560,00:01:09.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,The I
Dialogue: 0,00:01:09.640,00:01:14.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,would only teach one way of doing numerical integration for now that is a
Dialogue: 0,00:01:16.180,00:01:22.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,trapezoidal rule so if this is UT and this is T equal to 0 this is T equal to big T
Dialogue: 0,00:01:23.360,00:01:24.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,if you use a
Dialogue: 0,00:01:24.920,00:01:29.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,Something like finite difference you have you did you can discretize the function at
Dialogue: 0,00:01:31.160,00:01:32.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,grid points
Dialogue: 0,00:01:32.820,00:01:34.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,so 2 Delta T
Dialogue: 0,00:01:34.820,00:01:38.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,etc up to T is equal to n times Delta T and
Dialogue: 0,00:01:39.360,00:01:45.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,You have a function like this and the value of the function is known at these grid points
Dialogue: 0,00:01:47.800,00:01:54.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,The trapezoidal rule is very simple it is approximating the integral of the function
Dialogue: 0,00:01:54.920,00:01:57.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is the area under this curve
Dialogue: 0,00:01:58.340,00:02:01.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,by many small trapezoids
Dialogue: 0,00:02:02.260,00:02:08.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,So basically that means linking the every pair of grid points using a straight line
Dialogue: 0,00:02:09.600,00:02:16.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, and count how much area is beneath this straight line and this straight line
Dialogue: 0,00:02:18.240,00:02:22.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for example if you have u0 and u1 and u2 here
Dialogue: 0,00:02:24.920,00:02:26.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,What is the area?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:27.200,00:02:28.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,behind
Dialogue: 0,00:02:28.480,00:02:33.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,This trapezoid where this is 0 Delta T. This is u0 u1
Dialogue: 0,00:02:36.380,00:02:38.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes
Dialogue: 0,00:02:45.100,00:02:52.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,Exactly so that's how much area is under this curve, so how much area is under the summation of all these
Dialogue: 0,00:02:53.160,00:02:54.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,all these uh all these uh all these uh
Dialogue: 0,00:02:54.860,00:02:58.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,Linear lines, what is the summation of all the areas?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:59.480,00:03:03.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's basically a summation over you can pull Delta T out
Dialogue: 0,00:03:04.280,00:03:09.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's going to be a summation of I goes from 1 to n of
Dialogue: 0,00:03:10.240,00:03:17.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ui minus 1 plus ui so that's a very good approximation of this integral
Dialogue: 0,00:03:20.120,00:03:24.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if you want you can go back and do Taylor series analysis and convince yourself
Dialogue: 0,00:03:24.860,00:03:26.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is actually
Dialogue: 0,00:03:27.640,00:03:29.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,second-order approximation
Dialogue: 0,00:03:31.380,00:03:33.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah
Dialogue: 0,00:03:33.480,00:03:39.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,At least the second-order approximation depends on how smooth the function is right so so this is a
Dialogue: 0,00:03:40.260,00:03:43.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is what you can use to do the projects. I
Dialogue: 0,00:03:44.480,00:03:51.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Don't think today. I have time to go to intuitive methods so the rest of 10 minutes. I will see if
Dialogue: 0,00:03:51.900,00:03:54.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,Anybody wants to ask additional questions on the project?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:54.860,00:04:01.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,I want to say about this one. Yeah, we just focus on continuous functions. So no impulse functions are like periodic ones.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:01.860,00:04:05.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Like as they turn the water on, then it turns off, then it turns back on.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:05.860,00:04:07.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Like you do not have like that at all.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:07.860,00:04:13.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's up to you. It's up to you. So even if you do piecewise continuous functions
Dialogue: 0,00:04:13.500,00:04:19.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's also pretty easy to use this to integrate if you let's say turn this off at this point and turn it on again
Dialogue: 0,00:04:20.680,00:04:24.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,You can just focus on integrating this part of the solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:24.640,00:04:26.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:27.260,00:04:31.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,So there is there is nothing that prevents you to do piecewise continuous functions
Dialogue: 0,00:04:31.740,00:04:35.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,And also it also allows you to do non-uniform
Dialogue: 0,00:04:36.420,00:04:41.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,spacing in time so for example if you use ODE45 to integrate your ODE
Dialogue: 0,00:04:43.040,00:04:48.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,ODE45 is going to return you an array of time steps or time points, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:48.440,00:04:52.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,And there is no guarantee it will return you a uniform array of time points
Dialogue: 0,00:04:53.080,00:04:54.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,so instead of having
Dialogue: 0,00:04:54.600,00:04:57.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,a constant delta t the modification would be
Dialogue: 0,00:04:58.780,00:05:00.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,non constant
Dialogue: 0,00:05:00.820,00:05:06.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Delta t would be summation of i goes from 1 to n of delta t i
Dialogue: 0,00:05:08.720,00:05:14.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,ui plus 1 or ui minus 1 plus ui over 2 so this would be a
Dialogue: 0,00:05:15.900,00:05:20.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,same integral with non-uniform time steps
