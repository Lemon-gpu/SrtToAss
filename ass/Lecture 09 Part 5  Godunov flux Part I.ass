Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:07.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,The way to satisfy the entropy condition is a contribution by a person called Godunov.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:08.580,00:00:14.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,So he first constructed a numerical way to calculate the flux,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:15.080,00:00:18.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is a modification to the upwind flux
Dialogue: 0,00:00:18.240,00:00:22.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,that guarantees that the solution satisfies the entropy condition.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:24.080,00:00:25.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what is his solution?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:25.800,00:00:31.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,His solution, it's still, remember like in the upwind scheme,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:32.100,00:00:35.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,we are thinking of approximating the solution as piecewise constant.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:36.520,00:00:37.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Here we still do the same.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:38.420,00:00:44.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,So here we are explicitly considering that we are storing the solution averages,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:45.580,00:00:49.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,but then we are reconstructing the solution as piecewise constants.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:50.280,00:00:52.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's say this is our numerical solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:53.560,00:00:55.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so this is my...
Dialogue: 0,00:00:56.340,00:00:59.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,domain, this is my u, and this is delta x,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:00.140,00:01:06.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,2 delta x, etc. So in between every two grid points, the solution is a constant.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:07.560,00:01:11.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Of course, that's a first-order approximation, right? So we are going to get a first-order scheme.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:12.060,00:01:14.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,But like this is going to get us at least a
Dialogue: 0,00:01:15.720,00:01:21.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,entropy satisfying solution, and then we can talk about later how to extend that to second order and higher order.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:23.480,00:01:25.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,So with that piecewise constant approximation,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:25.800,00:01:34.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,we want to compute the flux at every interface.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:36.260,00:01:37.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:37.760,00:01:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,computing the flux is an interesting question because
Dialogue: 0,00:01:42.920,00:01:47.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,previously, we are considering that if this whole thing
Dialogue: 0,00:01:49.040,00:01:51.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,stays as a shockwave,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:51.880,00:01:53.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,what is going to be the flux?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:54.100,00:01:55.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:55.380,00:02:05.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have been using upwind, and to determine which side is upwind, we are using the speed of a shockwave,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:06.060,00:02:13.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,which implicitly assumes that this discontinuity is going to stay as a discontinuity after some time.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:14.700,00:02:17.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,In reality, we just looked at it is no longer the case,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:18.680,00:02:25.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,right? In some cases, this discontinuity is going to be no longer discontinuity,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:25.380,00:02:28.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,almost immediately after you start evolving in time.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:31.260,00:02:34.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, good enough insights is really from that.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:35.340,00:02:37.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's really
Dialogue: 0,00:02:37.120,00:02:40.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,analyzing for each, every interface, analyzing
Dialogue: 0,00:02:41.320,00:02:45.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,is that discontinuity going to be, if you solve the equation exactly,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:45.840,00:02:54.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,for infinitesimal amount of time, is that discontinuity still going to be a discontinuity after a while, after this infinitesimal amount of time?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:54.080,00:02:55.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:55.180,00:02:58.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,after that analysis, you should be figuring out,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:59.300,00:03:03.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,after this infinitesimal amount of time, what is the flux over there?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:03.560,00:03:06.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm just going to give you an example of the same
Dialogue: 0,00:03:07.180,00:03:14.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,thing we did before. So that is, if we have two cells, one cell being minus one, the other cell being plus one,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:15.560,00:03:18.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,okay, and the cell interface lies over here.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:21.140,00:03:23.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,According to the upwind flux,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:23.140,00:03:31.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,the speed is equal to zero. So it's okay to either choose the flux on the right or flux at the left.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:32.140,00:03:36.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Either way, the flux is going to be half of u squared, which is equal to half.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:38.460,00:03:41.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,But, use good enough insight.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:42.360,00:03:47.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,What is going to be the flux at this point after an infinitesimal amount of time?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:48.560,00:03:50.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Think of that.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:53.140,00:03:58.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,What is the shape of the function after an infinitesimal amount of time, if you are solving the equation exactly?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:59.620,00:04:05.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you should, after infinitesimal amount of time, you should have an infinitesimal range of solutions
Dialogue: 0,00:04:05.780,00:04:11.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,between minus one and one that goes linearly. That's right. Now, what is the flux at
Dialogue: 0,00:04:12.640,00:04:14.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,the interface
Dialogue: 0,00:04:14.700,00:04:16.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,after infinitesimal amount of time?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:18.620,00:04:19.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,Zero!
Dialogue: 0,00:04:19.900,00:04:23.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's right. Why is it zero? Because the value of the function,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:23.020,00:04:26.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,at this point, is going to become zero very soon, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:27.860,00:04:29.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,It'll stay zero for a while.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:30.440,00:04:38.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,And so the correct way to say the flux at this particular interface is the flux is equal to zero, not half.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:39.620,00:04:45.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's not, you shouldn't choose either the left side flux nor the right side flux. It is zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:46.340,00:04:49.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,Zero is the right flux to choose at this point.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:51.100,00:04:53.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, of course, this is a special case.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:53.020,00:04:57.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,What is the Moore general case? The Moore general case is exactly thinking like that.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:57.620,00:04:59.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you solve, if you
Dialogue: 0,00:05:00.140,00:05:02.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,analytically solve the differential equation
Dialogue: 0,00:05:03.200,00:05:08.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,in a very tiny region around the discontinuity for a very tiny amount of time,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:09.800,00:05:17.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,what is going to be the flux value? What is going to be the solution value at that discontinuity, at that, or not discontinuity, at this
Dialogue: 0,00:05:18.060,00:05:22.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,location where the discontinuity is at t equal to zero, but maybe not
Dialogue: 0,00:05:23.020,00:05:28.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,after a small amount of time. And then figure out the flux of that u value.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:30.060,00:05:32.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:32.320,00:05:34.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,There are many different cases.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:34.600,00:05:41.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,For example, if I have a discontinuity originally like that, and it has advected towards the right,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:42.100,00:05:43.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,I become like this.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:43.660,00:05:50.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then I should choose f of u left as my flux, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:51.100,00:05:52.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,If I have the flux towards the right, I become like this. I should choose f of u left as my flux. Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:52.700,00:05:52.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,If I have the flux towards the right, I become like this. Then I should choose f of u left as my flux. Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:52.800,00:05:57.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,if I have a discontinuity like this,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:58.920,00:06:02.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,and after a while it stays as a discontinuity
Dialogue: 0,00:06:02.300,00:06:04.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,but advected towards the left,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:04.420,00:06:09.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,then my correct f at this point is f of u right.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:10.760,00:06:11.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Do we agree?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:12.820,00:06:13.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:14.240,00:06:18.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,And there are other cases if originally I have a discontinuity.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:18.300,00:06:20.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean, we always originally have a discontinuity
Dialogue: 0,00:06:20.220,00:06:23.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,if we approximate the solution as piecewise constant.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:23.800,00:06:26.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,But later on, it becomes no longer a discontinuity.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:26.820,00:06:29.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's say it goes like this.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:30.100,00:06:32.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it no longer becomes a discontinuity,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:32.360,00:06:35.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,but it goes towards the left or towards the right.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:35.800,00:06:39.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,I still should be having f of u right.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:40.200,00:06:42.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if I originally have a discontinuity
Dialogue: 0,00:06:42.820,00:06:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and it becomes no longer a discontinuity
Dialogue: 0,00:06:46.000,00:06:48.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,but advects towards the right,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:48.320,00:06:50.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,I still want to use f.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:50.220,00:06:52.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I choose f of u left.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:52.780,00:06:57.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the very last case is I have a discontinuity in the beginning
Dialogue: 0,00:06:57.180,00:07:00.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the discontinuity becomes like that.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:02.180,00:07:05.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,While the right hand side of the solution goes towards the right,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:05.180,00:07:07.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,the left side of the solution goes towards the left.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:07.580,00:07:11.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then I should choose f of u,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:11.700,00:07:15.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,the particular value of u that stays stationary.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:18.120,00:07:18.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:18.620,00:07:20.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Do we see all these cases?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:20.220,00:07:20.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:20.860,00:07:25.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,The final case is when the left and right are equal but opposite sides.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:25.600,00:07:31.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,The last case is when the left and right have different characteristic speeds
Dialogue: 0,00:07:31.600,00:07:33.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,and they go towards different directions.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:33.840,00:07:36.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,They don't have to have equal value.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:37.980,00:07:41.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,The minus 1, 1 case is a special example.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:42.140,00:07:44.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,But even if you have minus 2, 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:44.880,00:07:47.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,you're still going to have the same problem.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:47.620,00:07:49.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,You still compute the wrong flux
Dialogue: 0,00:07:49.060,00:07:50.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,if you just use r.1.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:50.220,00:07:51.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the first case is the discontinuity.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:51.960,00:07:55.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,The discontinuity crosses the horizontal axis.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:55.460,00:07:56.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, yeah, okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:56.900,00:07:58.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for Burke's equation, that's right.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:58.900,00:08:00.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,For Burke's equation,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:00.900,00:08:06.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,because my characteristic speed df is equal to u,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:06.900,00:08:08.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,yeah, that's right,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:08.220,00:08:11.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,it only changes sign when u changes sign.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:11.540,00:08:15.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for Burke's equation, this would only happen if
Dialogue: 0,00:08:15.540,00:08:19.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,the value of the solution is positive on i plus 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:20.220,00:08:24.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we just let u choose here to get the solution of way back from wherever
Dialogue: 0,00:08:24.580,00:08:26.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is fta where the one-eighth?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:26.820,00:08:27.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,We get 2, 2, 2x.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:27.420,00:08:35.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the solution, i, 0x
Dialogue: 0,00:08:37.660,00:08:43.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,equals feet at in a want and
Dialogue: 0,00:08:45.960,00:08:47.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,it can't just satisfied when it's sorry.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:48.180,00:08:49.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well, that's true.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:49.080,00:08:49.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,But this is not wholly true.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:49.920,00:08:49.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,No, that's not true.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:49.940,00:08:57.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,It should go from negative to positive as u increases, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:57.620,00:09:02.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, that's right.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:02.980,00:09:14.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,So df du has to go from, let's say 0, from negative to positive, which means f has a
Dialogue: 0,00:09:14.520,00:09:24.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,watt over here, has a local maximum over here, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:24.260,00:09:32.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you look at f, it has a local maximum over here, and the value we choose to evaluate
Dialogue: 0,00:09:32.820,00:09:42.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,in this particular u is actually the maximum of f, is the local maximum of f at this location.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:42.260,00:09:43.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Do you get it?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:43.260,00:09:44.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Like, this is actually...
Dialogue: 0,00:09:44.260,00:09:44.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:44.520,00:09:55.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is max of f for u that is greater than ul and less than ur.
