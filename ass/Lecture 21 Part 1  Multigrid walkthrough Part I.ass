Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:04.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so yesterday we worked on the multi-grid algorithm.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:04.660,00:00:13.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the algorithm started with computing the residual of the matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:14.280,00:00:19.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's go back to the code we wrote by the end of our last lecture.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:20.300,00:00:26.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what the first part is doing is to compute the residual of the matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:26.700,00:00:34.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,We initialized R to be a zero vector, and for every grid point we computed R to be the right-hand side,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:35.420,00:00:45.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,minus the action of the discretization on the vector u0.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:46.960,00:00:52.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the residual. This is b minus a times u0.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:54.960,00:00:56.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in fact...
Dialogue: 0,00:00:56.700,00:01:00.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'd like to actually put this into a function.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:02.460,00:01:08.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if we put this into a function called residual,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:11.520,00:01:15.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,that'll make the code a bit cleaner.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:15.840,00:01:20.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the residual takes a u0 and b, and it should return a R.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:21.560,00:01:25.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we can move this part.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:26.700,00:01:31.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,The whole part into the residual function.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:35.720,00:01:38.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right, so that computes the residual.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:38.640,00:01:46.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we can call this R is going to be equal to residual u0 and b.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:47.920,00:01:55.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right, so the first step of the multi-grid is to compute the residual.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:56.700,00:02:03.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,And usually in a regular multi-grid, there is a...
Dialogue: 0,00:02:03.460,00:02:10.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,Before computing the residual, we usually perform a few iterations to pre-smooth the solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:10.520,00:02:16.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,We are going to talk about why do we need to pre-smooth the solution in the general setting.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:16.740,00:02:19.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,Last lecture we didn't pre-smooth the solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:19.740,00:02:20.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,The multi-grid worked.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:20.740,00:02:25.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,But let's add this into the multi-grid to perform a few pre-smoothing.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:25.820,00:02:26.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the pre-smoothing is a very important part of the solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:26.520,00:02:31.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,So pre-smoothing is the same as what we performed here.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:31.340,00:02:35.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,So basically perform a few Gauss-Seidel iterations.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:35.880,00:02:39.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, before we compute the residual.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:39.700,00:02:49.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that is, we are going to take u0 and perform a few Gauss-Seidel iterations.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:49.200,00:02:52.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I'll call this pre-smoothing.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:52.820,00:02:56.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then after pre-smoothing, we compute the residual.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:56.520,00:03:00.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, I don't need any comments here.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:00.040,00:03:05.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then we interpolate the residual to the cost grid.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:05.880,00:03:08.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,So because we made a...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:08.020,00:03:13.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's make it 5 and 5 to keep the computation cost exactly the same as before.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:13.700,00:03:14.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:14.700,00:03:15.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:15.700,00:03:18.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,After we interpolate...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:18.880,00:03:19.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:19.880,00:03:25.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,These two lines, line 10 and 11, are interpolation of R to the cost grid.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:25.240,00:03:26.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,In this case...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:26.520,00:03:32.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,The cost grid actually has grid points that lies exactly on every other grid point of
Dialogue: 0,00:03:32.520,00:03:33.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,the fine grid.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:33.520,00:03:36.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,Therefore, the interpolation is a trivial interpolation.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:36.660,00:03:41.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,We just take the value at these grid points.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:41.460,00:03:42.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:42.460,00:03:46.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,Not perform iterations.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:46.460,00:03:47.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,Iterations.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:47.460,00:03:51.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then we perform iterations on the cost grid.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:51.160,00:03:52.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:52.420,00:03:54.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,We performed smoothing on the fine grid.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:54.760,00:03:56.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,We computed the residual.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:56.520,00:03:59.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,We interpolated the residual onto the cost grid.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:59.420,00:04:01.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,In multi-grid, this is...
Dialogue: 0,00:04:01.320,00:04:02.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,This has a special name.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:02.920,00:04:03.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Going...
Dialogue: 0,00:04:03.920,00:04:07.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Interpolating the residual from the cost grid to fine grid...
Dialogue: 0,00:04:07.920,00:04:10.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,From fine grid to cost grid is called restriction.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:10.920,00:04:14.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this restriction operator is actually...
Dialogue: 0,00:04:14.760,00:04:18.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is interpolation.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:18.520,00:04:21.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:21.800,00:04:23.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,And now we are at the cost grid.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:23.520,00:04:24.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,At the cost grid...
Dialogue: 0,00:04:24.520,00:04:25.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,At the next cost grid...
Dialogue: 0,00:04:25.520,00:04:26.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,At the next cost grid...
Dialogue: 0,00:04:26.520,00:04:29.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,We perform another smoothing operation.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:29.420,00:04:30.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:30.420,00:04:33.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is when this didn't happen.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:33.420,00:04:40.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is when we are at the cost grid.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:40.280,00:04:43.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then we perform Gauss-Seidel iterations.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:43.220,00:04:49.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,But otherwise, we go into another multi-grid call.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:49.980,00:04:53.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the other multi-grid call, we go back to here.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:53.320,00:04:55.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we would be performing the pre-smoothing again.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:55.320,00:04:56.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:56.320,00:04:57.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:57.320,00:05:06.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's actually make a few breakpoints on this.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:06.220,00:05:08.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we'll take a look at...
Dialogue: 0,00:05:08.220,00:05:12.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we'll make a breakpoint before the pre-smoothing.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:12.220,00:05:15.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,After the pre-smoothing.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:15.220,00:05:16.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:16.220,00:05:20.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then after we compute...
Dialogue: 0,00:05:20.220,00:05:23.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,After we go into the cost grid.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:23.220,00:05:25.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we'll come over here.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:25.220,00:05:27.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,The interpolation...
Dialogue: 0,00:05:27.620,00:05:29.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,Before the interpolation.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:29.020,00:05:34.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,After the interpolation.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:34.120,00:05:38.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,And after the post-smoothing.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:38.120,00:05:39.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:39.120,00:05:40.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we will make a few breakpoints.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:40.120,00:05:46.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we will step through the multi-grid algorithm to see how it works.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:46.120,00:05:52.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So again, we are going to load the same B matrix we loaded in our last lecture.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:52.120,00:05:54.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So B is going to be here.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:54.120,00:05:58.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,Here we are going to make u equal to zeros the size of b.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:59.620,00:06:01.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, and let's start.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:02.020,00:06:05.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So u is equal to multi-grid of u and b.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:09.880,00:06:12.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the breakpoints didn't work.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:16.760,00:06:19.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, okay, so I think I opened the wrong file.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:20.080,00:06:20.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let me see.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:21.100,00:06:22.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let me save this.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:24.120,00:06:26.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think I opened the file from the last lecture.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:27.100,00:06:29.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's save it to the current lecture.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:30.520,00:06:32.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, replace it.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:33.760,00:06:36.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so let me make the breakpoints again.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:37.380,00:06:41.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,Before pre-smoothing, after pre-smoothing,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:41.780,00:06:43.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,and after interpolation,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:44.600,00:06:46.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,after the coarse-grid solution,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:53.000,00:06:53.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,and
Dialogue: 0,00:06:53.560,00:06:53.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,after
Dialogue: 0,00:06:54.120,00:06:56.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,interpolating to the fine-grid,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:56.120,00:06:58.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,and at the end of the iteration.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:58.120,00:07:01.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so let's make u equal to the zeros again,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:01.800,00:07:03.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,and do our multi-grid.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:03.800,00:07:06.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is in the beginning of the multi-grid,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:06.800,00:07:10.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,and our u0 should be completely zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:10.120,00:07:13.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if I do imshow of u0,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:13.120,00:07:17.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,I get a blank black image.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:17.120,00:07:19.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is my initial guess.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:20.120,00:07:23.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now let me continue.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:23.120,00:07:24.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:24.120,00:07:27.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,we performed a few pre-smoothing operations,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:27.120,00:07:28.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,only five, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:28.120,00:07:31.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now, when I perform imshow,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:31.120,00:07:33.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,what am I expected to get?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:35.120,00:07:36.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,I get,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:36.120,00:07:41.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,do you see a very faint white lines appearing on the screen?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:42.120,00:07:43.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:43.120,00:07:45.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, what this does,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:45.120,00:07:48.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,the five iterations of Gauss-Seidel,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:49.120,00:07:51.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,has smoothed,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:52.120,00:07:53.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,not the solution a little bit,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:53.120,00:07:55.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,but the solution error a little bit.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:55.120,00:07:56.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:56.120,00:07:59.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the effect of the smoothing.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:59.120,00:08:04.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,It reduces the solution error a little bit,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:04.120,00:08:09.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,and especially it reduces the high-frequency content of the solution error.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:09.120,00:08:13.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Remember, the solution error is the difference between the true solution
Dialogue: 0,00:08:13.120,00:08:16.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the solution we are getting right now.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:16.120,00:08:19.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,And therefore, by reducing the very smooth,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:19.120,00:08:22.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,by smoothing the solution error a little bit,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:22.120,00:08:24.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,what I'm doing is,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:24.120,00:08:31.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,the very sharp content of the solution is going to appear on my screen.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:31.120,00:08:32.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:32.120,00:08:33.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:33.120,00:08:37.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, now my solution error is a little bit smoother.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:37.120,00:08:40.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,That also, in this context,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:40.120,00:08:43.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,means the residual is a bit smoother.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:43.120,00:08:45.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, what I can do is,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:45.120,00:08:48.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,I can then compute the residual and,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:48.120,00:08:50.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,and interpret it.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:50.120,00:08:55.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,And interpolate the residual to my Gauss grid.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:55.120,00:08:58.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, come over here.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:58.120,00:09:01.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,My residual is now on my Gauss grid.

Dialogue: 0,00:10:36.120,00:10:37.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, it's a,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:37.120,00:10:39.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,you get the high frequency content of the solution,

Dialogue: 0,00:10:42.120,00:10:44.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:44.120,00:10:47.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, I computed the residual and interpolated again.

Dialogue: 0,00:10:48.120,00:10:49.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, now, I have to do the same thing

Dialogue: 0,00:10:56.120,00:10:58.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, of course, my U0 is again going to be 0,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:58.120,00:11:00.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,because now I'm solving the error equation

Dialogue: 0,00:11:05.120,00:11:09.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, now, I am at 256 by 256 grid.

Dialogue: 0,00:11:20.120,00:11:24.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,But remember, these very sharp contours on the small image,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:24.120,00:11:28.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,when I go back and interpolate to the coarser grid,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:28.120,00:11:32.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,it'll be the smooth portion of the solution on the,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:32.120,00:11:34.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,so, go back to the finer grid,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:34.120,00:11:37.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,it'll be a smooth features on the finer grid.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:37.120,00:11:39.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:39.120,00:11:40.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:40.120,00:11:42.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, keep going.

Dialogue: 0,00:11:57.120,00:12:00.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if I keep going,

Dialogue: 0,00:12:09.120,00:12:12.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Here.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:12.120,00:12:14.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,And now,
Dialogue: 0,00:12:14.120,00:12:15.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm at 8 by 8.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:16.120,00:12:22.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, here, if we look at the solution on the 8 by 8 grid,
Dialogue: 0,00:12:22.120,00:12:26.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,we get something that is,

Dialogue: 0,00:12:27.120,00:12:30.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, it's very hard to,
Dialogue: 0,00:12:30.120,00:12:35.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,basically we get like almost the most smooth portion,
Dialogue: 0,00:12:35.120,00:12:36.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,like that.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:36.120,00:12:37.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:37.120,00:12:39.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, we get the very smooth portion of the solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:39.120,00:12:44.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,And finally, when we,
Dialogue: 0,00:12:44.120,00:12:47.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,when we are at a coarser enough grid,
Dialogue: 0,00:12:47.120,00:12:49.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think we are at four,
Dialogue: 0,00:12:49.120,00:12:52.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,we are at four now.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:52.120,00:12:55.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, we'll still go through.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:55.120,00:12:56.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:56.120,00:12:58.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, when, so here, right.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:58.120,00:13:00.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, N on the finer grid,
Dialogue: 0,00:13:00.120,00:13:02.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,my size is equal to four on the coarser grid,
Dialogue: 0,00:13:02.120,00:13:03.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's even smaller.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:03.120,00:13:07.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, here, what I did is I performed a 10 Gauss-Seidel iterations
Dialogue: 0,00:13:07.120,00:13:09.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,on the coarser grid.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:09.120,00:13:11.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I come over to here.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:11.120,00:13:14.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, now, I'm interpolating my DU.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:14.120,00:13:16.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,To the finer grid.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:16.120,00:13:20.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, my DU,
Dialogue: 0,00:13:20.120,00:13:24.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,my DU here is,
Dialogue: 0,00:13:24.120,00:13:26.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,let me just type DU.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:26.120,00:13:29.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, my DU here is going to be a three by three matrix,
Dialogue: 0,00:13:29.120,00:13:31.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,three by three array.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:31.120,00:13:32.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:32.120,00:13:33.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, the boundaries are zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:33.120,00:13:36.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is the only solution I get.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:36.120,00:13:41.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, I'm basically solving a matrix equation with how many unknowns,
Dialogue: 0,00:13:41.120,00:13:43.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,in this case.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:44.120,00:13:47.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,With just a single unknown.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:47.120,00:13:48.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:48.120,00:13:52.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, this is probably an exact solution after 10 Gauss-Seidel.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:52.120,00:13:54.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean, this is, this must be an exact solution,
Dialogue: 0,00:13:54.120,00:13:56.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,even with one Gauss-Seidel iteration.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:56.120,00:14:02.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because I'm solving an equation with only one unknown.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:02.120,00:14:05.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then, I'm interpolating this to the finer grid.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:05.120,00:14:12.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,And adding the solution to the previous,
Dialogue: 0,00:14:12.120,00:14:14.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,previous solution after,
Dialogue: 0,00:14:14.120,00:14:16.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,after the pre-smooth.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:16.120,00:14:18.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, what I have gone is,
Dialogue: 0,00:14:18.120,00:14:20.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,I have gone through here.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:20.120,00:14:24.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,And sometimes, people use a direct solver on the Causs-Seidel grid.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:24.120,00:14:26.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because on the Causs-Seidel grid,
Dialogue: 0,00:14:26.120,00:14:31.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,the matrix is so small that usually a direct solver beats an iterative solver.
