Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:03.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,f has a negative slope.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:03.160,00:00:04.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, yeah, it's a minimum.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:04.540,00:00:04.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Sorry.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:05.500,00:00:06.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's a minimum.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:09.180,00:00:12.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right, so because df du is negative,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:12.380,00:00:17.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,so it has a negative slope at the left
Dialogue: 0,00:00:17.320,00:00:19.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,and a positive slope on the right.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:19.840,00:00:25.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So these are corresponding to u u f.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:26.920,00:00:27.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:28.440,00:00:29.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any questions about this?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:30.540,00:00:35.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if the characteristic of u changes sign,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:37.780,00:00:39.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,which means, in this case,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:39.900,00:00:44.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,f has a local minimum in the range of ul and ur,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:45.540,00:00:48.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,then I need to choose that minimum as my flux.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:49.540,00:00:52.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,Neither f of left nor f of right.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:53.340,00:00:58.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well, if f is monotonically increasing or decreasing,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:58.520,00:00:59.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,then, yeah, that would never happen.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:00.540,00:01:05.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right, so for example, for linear action equation
Dialogue: 0,00:01:05.060,00:01:09.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,where f is just proportional to u,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:10.720,00:01:12.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,you don't need to use this.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:12.240,00:01:14.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,You can just do upwinding or, yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:15.740,00:01:23.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, OK, so let's say this formula is also
Dialogue: 0,00:01:23.860,00:01:27.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,applicable to all the cases where u r
Dialogue: 0,00:01:27.280,00:01:27.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,is just a linear action equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:27.580,00:01:27.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:27.780,00:01:28.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, OK, so let's say this formula is also applicable to all the cases where u r is,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:28.980,00:01:29.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,is, is, is, is non-negotiable.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:29.020,00:01:29.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:29.540,00:01:32.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,is greater than ul.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:32.740,00:01:36.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for example, in this case, the entire short wave
Dialogue: 0,00:01:36.520,00:01:57.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,propagates towards the left, which means f of ur
Dialogue: 0,00:01:57.680,00:02:03.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,minus f of ul divided by bur minus ul is less than 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:11.560,00:02:21.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this means f has a negative slope in this range.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:21.280,00:02:27.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,And taking c.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:27.300,00:02:27.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's c.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:27.680,00:02:32.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the ur minus ul is.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:34.260,00:02:37.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So taking the minimum would be taking.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:39.920,00:02:44.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the denominator is greater than 0,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:44.460,00:02:47.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,which means the numerator is less than 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:47.520,00:02:53.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that means ul is greater than ur, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:54.860,00:02:56.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ul is greater than ur.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:56.440,00:02:56.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:57.680,00:03:00.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Taking the minimum over that range, what would I get?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:02.680,00:03:04.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,I would get ur, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:05.800,00:03:09.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So whenever ur is greater than ul,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:09.840,00:03:14.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,I want to take the minimum of the flux over this range.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:16.440,00:03:20.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the other case is also is the opposite.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:20.860,00:03:26.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So when ur is less than ul, I should be taking the maximum over this range.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:27.680,00:03:32.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for example, that would never happen in.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:32.680,00:03:36.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this kind of reverse scenario would never happen in Berger's equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:36.660,00:03:39.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,But you can think of if the flux is minus of u squared over 2
Dialogue: 0,00:03:39.980,00:03:44.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,instead of positive u squared over 2, then the scenario would happen.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:46.920,00:03:52.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the kind of shock wave would diffuse into expansion
Dialogue: 0,00:03:52.500,00:03:56.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,after infinitesimal amount of time.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:56.420,00:03:57.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the solution would be.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:57.560,00:03:59.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,The solution would go towards the left on the left side.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:59.600,00:04:02.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,The solution would go towards the right on the right side.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:02.900,00:04:03.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:04.160,00:04:08.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the case where ur is less than ul.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:09.680,00:04:17.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,And in this case, the derivative of f to u at ur,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:17.660,00:04:22.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is higher, is positive.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:24.360,00:04:25.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So at u.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:25.680,00:04:26.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So at ul.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:26.680,00:04:26.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,At u.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:26.920,00:04:27.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,At u.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:27.160,00:04:27.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,At u.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:27.460,00:04:27.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,At u.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:27.560,00:04:29.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,At ur is positive, sorry.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:29.660,00:04:31.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let me draw.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:31.460,00:04:32.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let me draw.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:32.820,00:04:36.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let me actually draw this case in the next page.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:38.140,00:04:42.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have a discontinuity that evolves into an expansion.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:43.280,00:04:46.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,We have ul greater than ur.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:47.000,00:04:49.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,And ur is over here.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:53.700,00:04:56.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So my df.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:56.760,00:04:57.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:57.400,00:04:57.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,dt.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:57.440,00:04:57.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,dt.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:57.480,00:04:57.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,dt.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:57.560,00:05:08.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,u over the range of u r which is less than u l is going to be like that so u r is positive
Dialogue: 0,00:05:09.960,00:05:16.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,the the uh the solution u r goes towards the right which means the characteristics is positive over
Dialogue: 0,00:05:16.120,00:05:21.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,here and this negative over here so the characteristics is going to going to cross
Dialogue: 0,00:05:21.080,00:05:29.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,zero over here which means on the function value of f we have a positive slope
Dialogue: 0,00:05:29.880,00:05:34.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then the negative slope and this point
Dialogue: 0,00:05:34.780,00:05:42.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,is the local arg max of f
Dialogue: 0,00:05:44.680,00:05:50.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,and at that point the characteristics has zero speed which exactly corresponds
Dialogue: 0,00:05:51.080,00:05:57.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,to the value where you should be evaluating the flux after infinitesimal amount of time
Dialogue: 0,00:05:58.920,00:06:12.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,so this case arg max of f u is greater than u r greater than less than u l is what should be
Dialogue: 0,00:06:12.600,00:06:19.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,choosing here so in in summary the flux at i plus half
Dialogue: 0,00:06:21.080,00:06:31.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,let's just say godunov scheme is equal to two cases one is equal to the maximum
Dialogue: 0,00:06:33.480,00:06:36.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,of f over
Dialogue: 0,00:06:38.840,00:06:39.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,over a region
Dialogue: 0,00:06:42.280,00:06:49.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,u r less than u less than u l if
Dialogue: 0,00:06:51.080,00:06:53.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,u l is greater than u r
Dialogue: 0,00:06:57.880,00:07:04.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,so left in this case is i r in this case is i plus one i should say that
Dialogue: 0,00:07:05.880,00:07:10.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,left is i right is i plus one
Dialogue: 0,00:07:12.440,00:07:20.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,and other case is the minimum of f over u i less than u less than u i plus one
Dialogue: 0,00:07:21.320,00:07:30.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,if u r is less than u r plus 1 and of course if u r is equal to us plus 1 F is just f of that u
Dialogue: 0,00:07:32.520,00:07:39.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,so this method is looking at a discontinuous solution at the interface evolve that solution
Dialogue: 0,00:07:39.800,00:07:46.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,analytically for absolute amount of time and look at what is the flux i should be using after that
Dialogue: 0,00:07:46.760,00:07:47.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,absolute amount of time all right this was all theFT regularly assume you're interested in my famous
Dialogue: 0,00:07:47.740,00:07:59.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright, and there is an analytical formula for that flux over here.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:59.920,00:08:09.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is a very elegant result, and unfortunately this only works for a scalar conservation
Dialogue: 0,00:08:09.360,00:08:10.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,law.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:10.680,00:08:16.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for a system of conservation laws, the same argument actually applies.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:16.720,00:08:23.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you can look at this continuous interface, solve that equation for epsilon amount of
Dialogue: 0,00:08:23.920,00:08:27.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,time and look at what flux you should be using there.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:27.580,00:08:33.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,But then we no longer have this very elegant formula.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:33.660,00:08:36.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,It becomes an equation-dependent problem.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:36.520,00:08:42.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,And there were entire PhDs that worked out for a particular system of equations what
Dialogue: 0,00:08:42.440,00:08:45.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,is the correct flux to use over here.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:45.600,00:08:46.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:46.600,00:08:51.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,there is also different ways to approximate, not exactly solve this problem of evolving
Dialogue: 0,00:08:51.900,00:08:54.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,for epsilon amount of time and computing the flux.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:54.600,00:08:58.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,There are also many methods developed to approximate that.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:58.900,00:09:04.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,But for scalar conservation laws, this is a very nice formula we can use.
