Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:11.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,very good and now let's try to use this to solve the Poisson's equation okay so
Dialogue: 0,00:00:11.200,00:00:18.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,so now we have these basis functions and remember in Poisson's equation we have
Dialogue: 0,00:00:18.840,00:00:28.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,the AIJ's being the integration of the derivative of a pair of basis functions
Dialogue: 0,00:00:28.600,00:00:41.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,plus a boundary term right and in particular we are if we have the zero
Dialogue: 0,00:00:41.980,00:00:51.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,delicious boundary condition so if we know you and zero is equal to u at 1
Dialogue: 0,00:00:51.880,00:00:58.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,equal to 0 what do we know about these linear combination coefficients
Dialogue: 0,00:00:58.600,00:01:11.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,so if we want to if we want to represent a u of X equal to summation of I goes
Dialogue: 0,00:01:11.200,00:01:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,from 0 to n ui of phi i of X we know that the first term can be 0 can be
Dialogue: 0,00:01:22.000,00:01:26.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,removed from this linear combination and the last term can be removed from the
Dialogue: 0,00:01:26.220,00:01:28.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,linear combination right
Dialogue: 0,00:01:28.600,00:01:36.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,so essentially the effect of the this particular boundary condition is
Dialogue: 0,00:01:36.060,00:01:44.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,reducing the dimensionality of the linear space it reduces the first and
Dialogue: 0,00:01:44.280,00:01:51.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,last basis to be redundant right you don't need any contribution from the
Dialogue: 0,00:01:51.160,00:01:54.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,base first basis and you don't need any contribution from the last basis or
Dialogue: 0,00:01:54.820,00:01:58.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,equivalently you can eliminate these two functions from the linear combination
Dialogue: 0,00:01:58.600,00:02:05.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,so basically we have the basic set so then we basically instead of I goes from
Dialogue: 0,00:02:05.360,00:02:15.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,0 we have I goes from 1 to n minus 1 right so that removes two basis functions
Dialogue: 0,00:02:15.000,00:02:27.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,two basis functions
Dialogue: 0,00:02:28.600,00:02:32.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,ok now why not
Dialogue: 0,00:02:32.980,00:02:35.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,we remove theses basis functions we only
Dialogue: 0,00:02:35.660,00:02:42.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,have the interior head functions whose whose values are 0 at both X and
Dialogue: 0,00:02:42.240,00:02:52.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,x equal to 0 and x equal to 1 so so the so the boundary terms the boundary terms
Dialogue: 0,00:02:52.460,00:02:57.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,we have phi j times the derivative of phi i at 0 and 1 is equal to 0 and 1 hier boat
Dialogue: 0,00:02:57.420,00:02:57.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,okay so here we are finding the MAS EST Nash V if we let the variation go from 0 to n you will see that the derivative fromostic解 from 0 and it can play off to the term with the difference in and if the asking which branch row average is equal to 1 and x which one mimic whose values represent the finals whose values are at 0 andasion equals to zero and x equals 1 so we now set a boundary conditions to equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:57.940,00:03:02.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,is equal to 0 for all the interior points for the all the interior basis
Dialogue: 0,00:03:02.420,00:03:14.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,functions right for for J equal to 1 all the way to M minus 1 C J times the
Dialogue: 0,00:03:14.800,00:03:26.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,derivative of C I to X is equal to 0 so we have a I J is equal to integration of
Dialogue: 0,00:03:26.440,00:03:39.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,V I DX and the derivative of V J DX so we only have a I J equal to that we also
Dialogue: 0,00:03:39.260,00:03:55.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,have B J equal to no derivative just the P J times F DX okay so let's figure out
Dialogue: 0,00:03:55.980,00:03:56.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,what the derivative of V I is equal to 0 for all the interior points for the all the
Dialogue: 0,00:03:56.420,00:04:04.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,interior points for the all the interior points for the all the interior points for the
Dialogue: 0,00:04:04.700,00:04:11.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,so for the matrix we are looking at the integral of the derivative of the
Dialogue: 0,00:04:11.100,00:04:16.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,product now the pro the integral of the product of the derivative of two basis
Dialogue: 0,00:04:16.760,00:04:25.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,functions and because of the locality of the basis functions so both VI and VJ
Dialogue: 0,00:04:25.140,00:04:26.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,are nonzero only zero so we can see that the derivative of the product of the
Dialogue: 0,00:04:26.420,00:04:45.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,monetary duty SSD complete using no linear Fish I
Dialogue: 0,00:04:45.820,00:04:50.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,this stoichiometric passion of this say pattern so now the D and the relative
Dialogue: 0,00:04:50.840,00:04:54.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,molar of their premiums is equal to zero we show the hermit Europeans are general
Dialogue: 0,00:04:54.940,00:04:56.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Association and I D viewer k
Dialogue: 0,00:04:56.220,00:05:02.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,or their support, the region in which they are non-zero, has no overlap,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:04.140,00:05:08.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,then their product is going to stay zero over the entire domain.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:09.980,00:05:22.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right, so remember we have, if this is x i, this is x j, we have many subintervals.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:22.320,00:05:32.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because x i, if you think of the derivative of x i, phi x, so this is phi i, this is phi j,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:32.940,00:05:34.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,they are both hat functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:35.100,00:05:42.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,The derivative of phi i and phi j are like what?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:44.560,00:05:50.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,The derivative of phi i is a constant positive value here and a constant negative here,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:50.200,00:05:51.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,and zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:51.240,00:05:53.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Everywhere else.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:53.040,00:05:58.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the derivative of phi j is positive here, negative here, and zero everywhere else.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:58.360,00:06:03.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you multiply the derivative of phi i with the derivative of phi j,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:03.660,00:06:07.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,the product is zero in the entire domain,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:07.660,00:06:12.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,because there is no interval in which both of the derivatives are non-zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:12.960,00:06:18.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for most of pairs of i and j, aij is going to be zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:21.240,00:06:28.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,aij is only non-zero when i and j are close enough.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:29.820,00:06:36.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,How close do they need to be for this entry to be non-zero?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:40.420,00:06:41.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well, of course, yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:43.180,00:06:46.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,They have to be immediate neighbors in this case, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:46.860,00:06:50.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if they are immediate neighbors,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:51.240,00:06:54.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,one of phi i is like that,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:55.320,00:06:57.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,phi j is going to be like that.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:57.740,00:07:01.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So they have one element of overlap
Dialogue: 0,00:07:01.260,00:07:06.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,in which the product of the derivatives are going to be non-zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:07.700,00:07:11.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or if i is equal to j, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:11.460,00:07:13.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,If i and j are equal,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:13.320,00:07:16.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,then the derivative are the same,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:16.640,00:07:19.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,and they are non-zero in two adjacent intervals.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:21.240,00:07:33.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,So aij non-zero if i minus j absolute value less or equal to 1, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:33.340,00:07:37.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,They are either immediate neighbors or they are the same.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:39.620,00:07:47.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if a matrix is non-zero only for absolute value of i minus j less or equal to 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:47.440,00:07:50.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,how does the sparsity pattern of the matrix look like?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:51.240,00:07:55.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's going to be a tri-diagonal matrix, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:56.840,00:07:57.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so good.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:57.680,00:08:07.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's try to construct this tri-diagonal matrix for one-dimensional space.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:07.900,00:08:14.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:14.700,00:08:14.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:21.240,00:08:28.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,, so here again, let's use the interval x to be a link space,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:28.740,00:08:31.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,0, 1, and n.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:31.740,00:08:37.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's choose n to be just a 10 to start with, n equal to 10.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:38.540,00:08:40.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so we have,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:41.940,00:08:44.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,we actually only have nine intervals in this case, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:44.940,00:08:50.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because x goes from 0 to 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:50.040,00:08:51.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,and there are nine intervals in this case.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:51.240,00:08:52.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have to put n in between.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:52.740,00:08:56.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's choose n equal to 9, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:56.740,00:08:57.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:57.740,00:09:03.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,So on that space, we have nine basis functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:03.740,00:09:06.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,If we know the solution has zero boundary conditions.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:06.740,00:09:09.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,If we know the solution has non-zero boundary conditions,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:09.740,00:09:11.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,we need more basis functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:11.740,00:09:14.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now we have nine basis functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:14.740,00:09:20.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,We want to construct the matrix A, which is, let's set 0, 9.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:20.740,00:09:22.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,In the beginning, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:22.240,00:09:26.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we know most of the entries are 0, so we set it to be 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:26.240,00:09:30.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's first construct the diagonal entries.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:31.240,00:09:38.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So how big are the diagonal entries of this matrix,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:40.240,00:09:43.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,which corresponds to i equals to j?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:44.240,00:09:49.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the diagonal entries are entries corresponding to
Dialogue: 0,00:09:50.740,00:09:55.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,aii is equal to integration from 0 to 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:55.240,00:10:00.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,The derivative of phi i squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:00.240,00:10:08.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we know it is non-zero only in two intervals.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:08.240,00:10:14.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Either the interval from xi minus 1 to xi,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:14.240,00:10:18.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the interval xi to xi.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:18.240,00:10:19.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the interval xi to xi.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:19.240,00:10:20.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the interval xi to xi.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:20.740,00:10:21.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,What's go on?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:21.740,00:10:22.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's all linear.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:22.740,00:10:23.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the all- punches.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:23.740,00:10:24.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then i equals O are from 1 to 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:24.740,00:10:26.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,So when we compute, y equals 1,

Dialogue: 0,00:10:46.740,00:10:56.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,x i plus 1 minus x i right so in this case all our axes are the same but we're
Dialogue: 0,00:10:56.580,00:11:03.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,going to evaluate to the X anyway so it's X 2 to n minus X 1 to n minus 1 and
Dialogue: 0,00:11:03.220,00:11:12.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,now we have the squared values in both domains and we also want to multiply
Dialogue: 0,00:11:12.720,00:11:18.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,this by the length of this integral so after multiplying by the interval
Dialogue: 0,00:11:18.300,00:11:22.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is X i minus X i minus 1 the square is gone again and once we
Dialogue: 0,00:11:22.920,00:11:28.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,multiply by this interval the minus 1 is gone and the square is gone so this
Dialogue: 0,00:11:28.880,00:11:39.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,a ii is equal to X i minus X i minus 1 plus 1 over X i plus 1 minus X i right
Dialogue: 0,00:11:39.900,00:11:41.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,so this is a ii
Dialogue: 0,00:11:42.720,00:12:00.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,so our DX right now is the length of the right so so this is a a ii is going to
Dialogue: 0,00:12:00.180,00:12:11.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,be a summation between two adjacent intervals so I think let me see
Dialogue: 0,00:12:12.720,00:12:21.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,right okay so I I made a mistake here when I'm constructing the matrix a so so
Dialogue: 0,00:12:21.800,00:12:29.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,should the matrix a be a length be a 9 by 9 matrix or 8x8 matrix should be 8x8
Dialogue: 0,00:12:29.880,00:12:42.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,matrix right because I only have oops I only have n minus 1 interior grid points
Dialogue: 0,00:12:42.720,00:13:04.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so it's an 8x8 matrix, and so the diagonal entries of A are, I should be making, so diagonal is a function that constructs a diagonal matrix from a vector,
Dialogue: 0,00:13:04.520,00:13:13.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,should be dx, so 1 over dx, 2 to n, plus 1 over dx, 1 to n minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:19.600,00:13:26.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So A has its diagonal entries assigned, right, so they are all 18.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:26.860,00:13:30.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now let's figure out the off-diagonal entries of A.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:31.780,00:13:32.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:33.180,00:13:34.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,The off-diagonal entries of A.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:34.520,00:13:43.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,The off-diagonal entries of A, A i, i plus 1, is going to be equal to an integration from 0 to 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:13:46.100,00:13:56.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,the derivative of phi i times the derivative of phi j, which is i plus 1, partial x dx.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:56.080,00:14:04.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this, because phi i is non-diagonal,
Dialogue: 0,00:14:04.520,00:14:10.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,is non-zero at interval between x i minus 1 and x i plus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:11.100,00:14:16.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,And phi i plus 1 is non-zero in the interval between phi i and phi i plus 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:17.060,00:14:23.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So their product is only non-zero between x i and x i plus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:28.540,00:14:32.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,And their derivatives are what?
Dialogue: 0,00:14:34.520,00:14:41.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,This derivative in between x i and x i, i minus 1, is something we derived before,
Dialogue: 0,00:14:42.600,00:14:48.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,minus 1 over x i plus 1 minus x i.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:48.840,00:14:53.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now this derivative is positive, because it's on the left of the basis.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:54.640,00:14:59.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,But the value is the same, it's also 1 over the same interval length.
