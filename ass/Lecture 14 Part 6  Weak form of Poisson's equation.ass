Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:12.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the reason we are defining the sub-left space is because it's the kind of sub-left space that we can define the weak form of the differential equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:12.260,00:00:27.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for example, in our previous Poisson's equation, we derived the equivalent form of the Poisson's equation,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:27.120,00:00:35.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,that is, integration of the product between the derivative of a test function and a solution,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:36.460,00:00:42.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,plus the integration of the test function times the right-hand side, is equal to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:42.260,00:00:43.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that was an example.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:45.320,00:00:50.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,And in order to say this is equivalent to the differential equation in some sense,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:50.600,00:00:55.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,we need to restrict both u and v into a space.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:56.920,00:01:01.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,And in our previous example, we directly went to a finite dimensional space.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:02.900,00:01:06.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,But of course, going to a finite dimensional space makes an approximation.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:07.260,00:01:10.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,It makes an approximation to the differential equation,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:10.120,00:01:12.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,and through this...
Dialogue: 0,00:01:12.260,00:01:13.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,this weak form.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:13.260,00:01:17.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,But if we don't restrict the u and v to a finite dimensional space,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:17.260,00:01:22.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,but restrict it to a sub-left space, which is infinite dimensional,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:23.260,00:01:27.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,we can say that the solution recovers the solution of the differential equation exactly.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:29.260,00:01:30.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:31.260,00:01:32.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So...
Dialogue: 0,00:01:35.260,00:01:39.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the weak form of the equation is to...
Dialogue: 0,00:01:42.260,00:01:52.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,the weak form of the Poisson's equation is the following.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:53.260,00:02:01.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So find a solution u in H1 of A and B.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:01.260,00:02:04.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,H1 is the sub-left space we defined earlier.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:05.260,00:02:06.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Such that...
Dialogue: 0,00:02:07.260,00:02:10.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,for all v,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:10.260,00:02:11.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,we call it test function,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:11.260,00:02:14.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,we call it test function within the same space.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:16.260,00:02:17.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:21.260,00:02:24.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,This box is true.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:27.260,00:02:28.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:28.260,00:02:32.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Which is like the integral plus the integral equal to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:32.260,00:02:34.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this box is the same as this box.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:34.260,00:02:38.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the weak form of the Poisson's equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:39.260,00:02:40.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,And it's a weak form because...
Dialogue: 0,00:02:40.260,00:02:42.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,if...
Dialogue: 0,00:02:42.260,00:02:47.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,if f is regular enough,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:47.260,00:02:51.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,so if f is a smooth function, let's say, or continuous function,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:53.260,00:02:56.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,then we have a twice-differentiable u, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:56.260,00:03:00.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because if f is a function,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:00.260,00:03:02.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,actually any function,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:02.260,00:03:06.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,then the second-order derivative of u has to be equal to that function,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:06.260,00:03:09.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,which means, of course, that u is twice-differentiable.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:10.260,00:03:12.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,If that is the case,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:12.260,00:03:14.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,then the solution of the weak form
Dialogue: 0,00:03:14.260,00:03:19.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,is equivalent to the solution of the strong form of the differential equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:20.260,00:03:23.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,But it is weaker in the sense that...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:24.260,00:03:27.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,if f is not a function,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:28.260,00:03:30.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,so it holds,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:30.260,00:03:33.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,even if f is not a function,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:36.260,00:03:39.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,even if f is a distribution,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:40.260,00:03:42.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,it is a function instead of a function.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:42.260,00:03:44.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,And...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:44.260,00:03:48.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,for example, what is an example of a distribution that is not a function?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:48.260,00:03:50.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Hm?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:50.260,00:03:51.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Sorry?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:51.260,00:03:55.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,A Dirac, right, or a delta function, a Dirac delta function.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:55.260,00:03:57.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for example,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:57.260,00:04:03.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,let's say f of x is equal to a Dirac delta function x minus 0.5,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:03.260,00:04:07.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,and our domain is in 0 and 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:07.260,00:04:08.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:08.260,00:04:11.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,We can see that it doesn't make sense to say
Dialogue: 0,00:04:11.260,00:04:15.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,the second-order derivative of u plus a delta function is equal to 0,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:15.260,00:04:18.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,but it does make a lot of sense to say
Dialogue: 0,00:04:18.260,00:04:21.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,this integral is always equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:21.260,00:04:25.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because if f is a Dirac function,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:25.260,00:04:29.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,then what is the integral of f times v?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:31.260,00:04:34.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's just the value of v, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:34.260,00:04:37.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's just the value of v at 0.5.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:38.260,00:04:43.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's perfectly well-defined, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:43.260,00:04:45.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so in this case,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:45.260,00:04:47.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,what we are going to get,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:47.260,00:04:50.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,so let's figure out what we are going to get here.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:50.260,00:04:52.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what we get is that
Dialogue: 0,00:04:52.260,00:04:56.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,the integration of a and b of any v times,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:56.260,00:04:58.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,not any v, partial v partial x,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:58.260,00:05:01.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,partial u partial x dx,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:01.260,00:05:04.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,has to be equal to v at 0.5.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:08.260,00:05:12.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so what does this tell us?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:14.260,00:05:17.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,It tells us that the u,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:19.260,00:05:23.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,so it tells us that u is not twice differentiable.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:23.260,00:05:25.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,We are going to solve it later.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:25.260,00:05:27.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,We haven't defined the boundary conditions yet.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:27.260,00:05:31.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,But it tells me that u has to be a piecewise linear function
Dialogue: 0,00:05:31.260,00:05:37.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,and this derivative has to be discontinuous at 0.5.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:38.260,00:05:40.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,To see this,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:40.260,00:05:46.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,let's define a boundary condition for this equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:46.260,00:05:48.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,For example, let's define
Dialogue: 0,00:05:48.260,00:05:54.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,with u equal to u equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:54.260,00:05:58.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's define a most trivial boundary condition.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:58.260,00:06:00.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,And what we need to do is,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:00.260,00:06:02.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,this boundary condition is,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:02.260,00:06:03.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,we are going to talk about later,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:03.260,00:06:06.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,is an essential boundary condition that restricts
Dialogue: 0,00:06:06.260,00:06:07.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,this,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:08.260,00:06:11.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,that shrinks the space.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:11.260,00:06:14.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we call it h1 0
Dialogue: 0,00:06:14.260,00:06:20.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,because this is equal to all the f within h1,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:20.260,00:06:22.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,a and b,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:22.260,00:06:27.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,such that f0 is equal to f1 is equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:27.260,00:06:31.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So all the functions that satisfy a certain boundary condition.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:31.260,00:06:34.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right, so it's even a smaller space.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:34.260,00:06:37.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So then for all the v in the same space,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:37.260,00:06:41.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is also have to be satisfying the boundary condition,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:41.260,00:06:43.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,we have the,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:43.260,00:06:48.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,we have the weak form to be true.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:48.260,00:06:59.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so now if we know both u and v satisfy the boundary condition.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:59.260,00:07:05.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, and so here what we can see is that
Dialogue: 0,00:07:05.260,00:07:11.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,one way for this to be always true is for u to be a linear function
Dialogue: 0,00:07:11.260,00:07:13.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,in both.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:13.260,00:07:16.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, so for this to be true,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:16.260,00:07:27.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,u has to be linear in 0 and 0.5 and 0.5 and 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:27.260,00:07:32.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because a linear function means the derivative is going to be a constant.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:32.260,00:07:33.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:33.260,00:07:39.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,A constant times the derivative of v integrated between 0 and 0.5
Dialogue: 0,00:07:39.260,00:07:43.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,is going to give me the value of v at 0.5.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:43.260,00:07:51.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,And so let's do this.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:51.260,00:07:59.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the integral of a and b of these is going to be equal to,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:59.260,00:08:01.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,so let's say a is equal to 0, b is equal to 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:01.260,00:08:02.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:02.260,00:08:07.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So b is equal to 1 is going to be equal to from 0 to 0.5
Dialogue: 0,00:08:07.260,00:08:22.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,of du dx left times dv dx times dx plus du dx right.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:22.260,00:08:26.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, so u is going to be split into two halves.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:26.260,00:08:31.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So u is going to be like that.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:31.260,00:08:32.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:32.260,00:08:36.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,And it has to satisfy the boundary conditions.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:36.260,00:08:46.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,And you get partial v partial x dx 0.5 to 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:46.260,00:08:49.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what we ended up getting is that,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:49.260,00:08:57.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,so du dx,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:57.260,00:09:01.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,so du dx at the left is basically 2.5.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:01.260,00:09:07.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So basically 2 times u, u at 0.5, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:07.260,00:09:14.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because this is 0.5, this is 1, and this is u at 0.5.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:14.260,00:09:21.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you divide by 0.5, you get the slope at the left times v at 0.5.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:21.260,00:09:26.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the other quantity is the slope of u is negative.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:26.260,00:09:29.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So minus u times 0.5.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:31.260,00:09:38.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the integral of v dv dx over the second half of the domain,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:38.260,00:09:41.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,because v is also satisfied the boundary condition 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:41.260,00:09:45.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's going to be minus v at 0.5.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:45.260,00:09:59.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,And with that summed together, we have 4 times u at 0.5 times v at 0.5.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:59.260,00:10:00.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:00.260,00:10:07.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what we are doing is that we have constructed a u that is in H1.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:07.260,00:10:08.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:08.260,00:10:13.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,u is in H1 because u is a hat function.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:13.260,00:10:15.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's continuous.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:15.260,00:10:17.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,The square is integrable.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:17.260,00:10:19.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,The derivative of u is also integrable.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:19.260,00:10:21.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's no longer continuous at 0.5.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:21.260,00:10:23.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's piecewise constant.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:23.260,00:10:26.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,But the square of that is still integrable.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:26.260,00:10:29.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we constructed a u that is not twice differentiable,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:29.260,00:10:32.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,but in H1.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:32.260,00:10:39.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,That satisfies the weak form for a right-hand side being a delta function.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:39.260,00:10:40.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:40.260,00:10:45.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So to get the u, this is equal to v at 0.5.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:45.260,00:10:52.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,That basically means u at 0.5, this has to be 1 fourth.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:52.260,00:10:54.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:54.260,00:10:57.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So with u equal to 1 fourth,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:57.260,00:10:59.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,this is going to be equal to v at 0.5,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:59.260,00:11:01.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is the right-hand side we want.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:01.260,00:11:05.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we constructed a v that goes from 0 to 1 fourth
Dialogue: 0,00:11:05.260,00:11:08.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,when x goes from 0 to 0.5 and then goes down to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:08.260,00:11:11.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,That satisfies the boundary condition.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:11.260,00:11:17.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,It satisfies the weak form for f.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:17.260,00:11:20.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,That is a distribution.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:20.260,00:11:22.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,That is not a function.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:22.260,00:11:25.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the weak form is weaker in that sense.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:25.260,00:11:28.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's somewhat...
Dialogue: 0,00:11:28.260,00:11:33.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,The sense of that is similar to how we change the strong form,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:33.260,00:11:37.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,the differential form, to the integral form in finite volume.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:37.260,00:11:38.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:38.260,00:11:39.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,In finite difference...
Dialogue: 0,00:11:39.260,00:11:43.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,In finite element, we also transform the equation to a weak form
Dialogue: 0,00:11:43.260,00:11:45.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,using integration by parts like that.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:45.260,00:11:48.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the weak form is weaker in the sense that
Dialogue: 0,00:11:48.260,00:11:52.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,the exact equation, differential form,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:52.260,00:11:54.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,does not have to make any sense.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:54.260,00:11:56.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Make any sense, even.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:56.260,00:11:59.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,For right-hand sides that are not even a function.
