Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:04.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,How to analyze stability. So last time we touched a little bit on how to do
Dialogue: 0,00:00:04.680,00:00:12.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,stability analysis looking at the norm of a matrix. Today we'll learn the
Dialogue: 0,00:00:12.400,00:00:18.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,most powerful method of doing stability analysis for PDEs. It's called the
Dialogue: 0,00:00:18.280,00:00:25.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,von Neumann stability analysis. I'm gonna start with a very simple example.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:25.120,00:00:30.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Still we are solving this equation partial u partial t equal to a kappa
Dialogue: 0,00:00:30.320,00:00:37.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,times partial square u partial x square. And von Neumann stability analysis is
Dialogue: 0,00:00:37.400,00:00:44.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,not just for any domain. It's for domains without a boundary. So what does that
Dialogue: 0,00:00:44.160,00:00:52.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,mean? It means von Neumann stability analysis cannot analyze the effect of
Dialogue: 0,00:00:52.080,00:00:54.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,complex boundary conditions.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:54.120,00:00:55.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,It doesn't mean that the boundary conditions are not
Dialogue: 0,00:00:55.100,00:01:00.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,stable. It can only analyze the stability of your discretization
Dialogue: 0,00:01:00.160,00:01:05.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,itself. The discretization of the differential equation itself instead of
Dialogue: 0,00:01:05.180,00:01:11.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,the boundary. So when you look at the differential equation and you want
Dialogue: 0,00:01:11.340,00:01:17.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,to know if it's stable or not, you want to both make sure the discretization of
Dialogue: 0,00:01:17.480,00:01:22.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,the PDE is stable and also the boundary condition is well-posed.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:22.020,00:01:24.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,The discrete boundary condition is well posed. So for von Neumann stability analysis
Dialogue: 0,00:01:24.900,00:01:32.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,analysis takes care of the first part. Alright, so remember in our first lecture
Dialogue: 0,00:01:32.940,00:01:41.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,we did Fourier analysis, right? We split u into a summation of different
Dialogue: 0,00:01:41.880,00:01:51.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,Fourier modes. k goes from minus infinity to infinity. u hat of k times e to the j
Dialogue: 0,00:01:51.360,00:02:06.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is the square root of minus 1 times k times x. Alright, so this is, this
Dialogue: 0,00:02:06.300,00:02:19.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,can be done for periodic domain of x goes from 0 to 2 pi, right? So domains
Dialogue: 0,00:02:19.560,00:02:20.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,without a boundary means
Dialogue: 0,00:02:20.980,00:02:27.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,the best way to think of a domain without boundary is periodic. So if you
Dialogue: 0,00:02:27.460,00:02:32.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,go out of one end you come back to the other. In two dimensions you can do a
Dialogue: 0,00:02:32.920,00:02:37.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,doubly periodic domain. It's like a computer screen. If you go out of the
Dialogue: 0,00:02:37.160,00:02:40.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,right hand side you come back from the left hand side like playing a video game.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:40.180,00:02:47.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Mathematically that domain, periodic domain in two dimensions is officially
Dialogue: 0,00:02:47.920,00:02:49.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,called a torus.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:49.480,00:02:50.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,Why?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:50.980,00:02:57.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because a one dimensional periodic domain is like a circle, right? So you go out
Dialogue: 0,00:02:57.440,00:03:10.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,of one end, you come back from the other. A torus is like, it's like, it's
Dialogue: 0,00:03:10.460,00:03:15.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,like, it's like that. So, so it's, there are two periodic dimensions one periodic
Dialogue: 0,00:03:15.680,00:03:20.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,is along the ring and the other periodic is around it's a wrong, it's like a dot.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:20.980,00:03:22.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,so you have a double periodic domain.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:23.680,00:03:24.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,But in this case,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:25.640,00:03:30.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,the Newman stability analysis applies both to 1D, 2D, and 3D.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:30.620,00:03:33.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's first look at this problem in 1D.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:34.220,00:03:38.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So when we express a function on the periodic domain
Dialogue: 0,00:03:38.320,00:03:40.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,as a Fourier series,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:41.460,00:03:43.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,that essentially decouples
Dialogue: 0,00:03:43.640,00:03:47.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,the different Fourier modes for a linear PDE.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:47.920,00:03:52.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because when I plug this into the equation,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:53.240,00:03:55.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,we get the left-hand side becomes a summation of
Dialogue: 0,00:03:55.960,00:03:58.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,d u hat k dt
Dialogue: 0,00:03:58.740,00:04:02.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,e to the ijx.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:03.260,00:04:06.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that is the left-hand side.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:06.520,00:04:08.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the right-hand side becomes
Dialogue: 0,00:04:08.980,00:04:13.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,kappa times summation of u hat k
Dialogue: 0,00:04:13.080,00:04:16.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,when you take twice derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:17.920,00:04:21.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,The jk comes out of the exponential two times.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:21.880,00:04:25.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So jk squared is minus k squared
Dialogue: 0,00:04:25.240,00:04:28.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,times e to the jkx.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:31.700,00:04:34.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,Both are summation over k
Dialogue: 0,00:04:34.100,00:04:35.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,goes from minus infinity to infinity.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:36.500,00:04:38.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you match the coefficients,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:39.840,00:04:44.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,the coefficients on this side is this,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:44.860,00:04:46.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,on that side is this.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:46.880,00:04:47.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,What you get is,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:47.920,00:04:50.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,d u hat k dt
Dialogue: 0,00:04:50.240,00:04:52.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,equal to kappa
Dialogue: 0,00:04:52.240,00:04:55.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,times minus k squared
Dialogue: 0,00:04:55.380,00:04:56.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,times u hat of k.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:57.380,00:05:00.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you know all the coefficients are decaying
Dialogue: 0,00:05:00.620,00:05:02.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,except for the k equal to 0, 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:03.500,00:05:04.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the bigger the k is,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:05.620,00:05:07.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,the bigger the magnitude of k is,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:07.540,00:05:09.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,the faster the coefficient decays.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:11.020,00:05:13.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,That is voluminous stability analysis
Dialogue: 0,00:05:13.460,00:05:15.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,for the continuous differential equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:17.920,00:05:20.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,But we can apply exactly the same thing
Dialogue: 0,00:05:20.860,00:05:24.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,for the discrete differential equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:25.160,00:05:25.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:25.900,00:05:29.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's look at after discretization.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:30.180,00:05:32.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So after discretization,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:32.480,00:05:33.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,we have...
