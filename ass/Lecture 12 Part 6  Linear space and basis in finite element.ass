Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:08.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,When we are performing a minimization, we are performing it over all possible functions that satisfies a certain criterion.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:08.660,00:00:12.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,And these all possible functions is what we call the space.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:14.340,00:00:20.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,And here I'm going to give two examples of that space over here.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:22.360,00:00:28.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the first example is x is the space.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:28.080,00:00:31.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the space is a set of functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:32.080,00:00:35.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's a collection of functions that satisfy a certain criterion.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:35.440,00:00:53.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,For example, is f of x between 0 and 1 such that for all i.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:53.920,00:00:54.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:55.180,00:00:58.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for all the i.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:58.080,00:01:07.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,We are still representing the space using a finite number of intervals.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:07.040,00:01:10.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,And these intervals are now what we call elements.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:12.040,00:01:19.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,And for reasons I'm going to discuss a little bit later, let's now, instead of labeling the elements as integers,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:20.080,00:01:22.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,let's label the element boundaries as integers.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:22.980,00:01:25.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,1, 2, 3, 4, etc.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:25.780,00:01:28.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for all the i's.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:28.080,00:01:30.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's see.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:31.660,00:01:42.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,fx is linear in x in xi minus 1 and xi.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:44.960,00:01:45.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:45.880,00:01:49.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is one class of functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:50.960,00:01:55.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,So can somebody tell me does this correspond to this case or the previous case?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:56.680,00:01:57.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,This one, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:57.840,00:01:58.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:58.080,00:02:02.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because I'm no longer requiring my x to be continuous.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:04.080,00:02:04.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,So.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:05.960,00:02:13.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for example, when i is equal to 1, when x is in x0 and x1, the function is linear like this.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:14.080,00:02:16.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,In between 1 and 2, the function can be like that.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:16.880,00:02:17.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:17.280,00:02:22.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I can have a function that is like that to approximate whatever function I want to approximate.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:23.760,00:02:27.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,The second case, which is the case we're going to discuss in this lecture.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:27.880,00:02:33.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is putting an additional constraint on the function.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:37.880,00:02:40.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,And f is continuous.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:45.480,00:02:46.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Continuous.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:48.040,00:02:54.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,And for all the i, fx is linear.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:56.380,00:02:56.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,In x.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:56.880,00:02:58.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,x.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:59.280,00:03:00.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,i minus 1 and xi.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:03.680,00:03:09.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is a space that I require the function to be not only piecewise linear but continuous.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:10.080,00:03:16.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So these are these kind of piecewise lines that I can draw with one stroke.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:17.440,00:03:17.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:20.360,00:03:20.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:21.680,00:03:26.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,What I claim is that this space of x satisfies a particular.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:26.280,00:03:30.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Particularly nice properties called linearity.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:30.280,00:03:32.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what does linearity mean?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:32.280,00:03:40.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Linearity means that if I have x1 and x2 both in the space x.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:40.280,00:03:42.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:42.280,00:03:44.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,So linearity.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:44.280,00:03:50.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is not linearity of the function but linearity of the function space.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:50.280,00:03:51.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:51.280,00:03:53.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's different from the linearity of the function f.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:53.280,00:03:55.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Linearity of the function f just says like f is a straight line.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:55.280,00:03:56.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you put it like this.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:56.280,00:03:57.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,You plot it.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:57.280,00:04:00.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,But linearity of the function space is something different.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:00.280,00:04:06.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's saying that for any pair of f1 and f2 in that linear space.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:06.280,00:04:20.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,a1 times f1 plus a2 times f2 is also in the space for any real numbers a1 and a2.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:20.280,00:04:21.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:21.280,00:04:22.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,So.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:22.280,00:04:31.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any linear combination of any two elements in the space also belongs to the same space.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:31.280,00:04:33.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,That is linearity.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:35.280,00:04:37.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in this case why is the case?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:37.280,00:04:40.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Why is this particular space linear?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:40.280,00:04:42.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's check it.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:43.280,00:04:45.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,First of all if I have a function like that.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:45.280,00:04:48.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,If I scale the function by a real number.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:48.280,00:04:50.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,The scaled function.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:50.280,00:04:53.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's say if I scale it to a little bigger.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:53.280,00:04:56.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,The scaled function would look like that.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:56.280,00:04:58.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Of course it's still continuous.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:58.280,00:05:03.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,And of course for every interval the scaled function is also linear.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:03.280,00:05:04.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:04.280,00:05:08.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if I have f1 in x.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:08.280,00:05:11.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,a1 times f1 is also in x.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:11.280,00:05:14.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Again if I have f2 in x.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:14.280,00:05:16.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,a2 times f2 is also in x.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:16.280,00:05:17.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is pretty much linear.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:17.280,00:05:22.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is because scaling is invariant.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:22.280,00:05:24.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Scaling is.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:24.280,00:05:27.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean the x is invariant to scaling.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:27.280,00:05:33.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,And also if I have both a1 f1 and a2 f2 in the space.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:33.280,00:05:39.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Adding them together the sum of two continuous functions is continuous.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:39.280,00:05:43.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the sum of two linear functions is linear.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:43.280,00:05:44.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,So.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:44.280,00:05:47.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,a1 f1 plus a2 f2 is also.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:47.280,00:05:50.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Continuous and piecewise linear.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:50.280,00:05:53.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Therefore we can prove that x is a linear space.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:53.280,00:05:57.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,By simply arguing about the properties of the functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:57.280,00:06:00.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,It has to satisfy.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:00.280,00:06:01.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:01.280,00:06:07.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any questions so far?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:07.280,00:06:09.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:09.280,00:06:10.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:10.280,00:06:12.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,We need to introduce the concept.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:12.280,00:06:14.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Once we have a linear space.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:14.280,00:06:16.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,A linear space is particularly nice.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:16.280,00:06:26.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,That it has this thing called a basis.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:26.280,00:06:27.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:27.280,00:06:33.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,A basis in a linear space.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:33.280,00:06:37.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,x1 x2 all the way to xn for example.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:37.280,00:06:41.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is a basis.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:41.280,00:06:43.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is a basis.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:46.280,00:06:56.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Of x.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:56.280,00:06:57.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,If and only if.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:57.280,00:06:58.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,The following properties are satisfied.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:58.280,00:06:59.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,So first of all.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:59.280,00:07:00.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,For any x.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:00.280,00:07:01.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,In that linear space.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:01.280,00:07:02.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,X can be represented as a linear combination.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:02.280,00:07:03.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Of these basis.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:03.280,00:07:04.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:04.280,00:07:05.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the first property.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:05.280,00:07:06.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,But that's not the case.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:06.280,00:07:07.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:07.280,00:07:08.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,The first property.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:08.280,00:07:09.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is the linear space.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:09.280,00:07:10.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the second property.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:10.280,00:07:11.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is the linear space.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:11.280,00:07:12.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the third property.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:12.280,00:07:13.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is the linear space.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:13.280,00:07:14.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the fourth property.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:14.280,00:07:15.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is the linear space.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:15.280,00:07:16.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the first property.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:16.280,00:07:17.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,But that's not enough.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:17.280,00:07:18.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Another property is that.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:18.280,00:07:19.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,For any.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:19.280,00:07:20.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Another property.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:20.280,00:07:21.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let me just say like this.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:21.280,00:07:22.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Another property is that.

Dialogue: 0,00:08:13.280,00:08:14.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Different.

Dialogue: 0,00:08:15.280,00:08:21.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,clues you from having a basis in which xn can be represented as a linear
Dialogue: 0,00:08:21.900,00:08:30.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,combination of x1 x2 to xn-1. Because if you can do that, xn is of course a
Dialogue: 0,00:08:30.440,00:08:39.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,member of x, right? And then xn has two different representations. One
Dialogue: 0,00:08:39.280,00:08:44.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,representation is that xn is equal to a summation where all the a i's are zero
Dialogue: 0,00:08:44.760,00:08:51.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,except for a n which is 1. So xn is equal to xn. And also it has a different
Dialogue: 0,00:08:51.300,00:08:56.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,representation using only the values x1 to xn-1. So the
Dialogue: 0,00:08:56.640,00:09:03.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,representation of a summation of a i is not unique, right? So basically if we
Dialogue: 0,00:09:03.020,00:09:08.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,have property 2 that means any members of the basis cannot be represented as a
Dialogue: 0,00:09:08.520,00:09:12.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,linear combination of the other members.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:13.040,00:09:14.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:14.760,00:09:25.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,Also it means if we have a basis we cannot add anything onto the basis. So if
Dialogue: 0,00:09:25.180,00:09:30.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,we add any other members of x onto the basis it becomes no longer a basis.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:30.140,00:09:37.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because if we add another member that that additional member would be able to
Dialogue: 0,00:09:37.760,00:09:41.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,be represented either just as a linear combination of itself or as a linear
Dialogue: 0,00:09:41.600,00:09:44.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,combination of the previous set of basis.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:44.760,00:09:47.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:47.760,00:09:54.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any questions so far?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:54.760,00:10:02.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the basis is very useful because it reduces an optimization problem. It reduces a least
Dialogue: 0,00:10:02.980,00:10:09.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,squares problem just like what we saw before. From a least squares problem in the abstract
Dialogue: 0,00:10:09.520,00:10:10.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,function space to a least squares problem that a computer can solve.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:10.680,00:10:11.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:11.680,00:10:12.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's the basic.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:12.680,00:10:13.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Thank you.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:13.680,00:10:14.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Thank you.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:14.680,00:10:16.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Thank you.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:16.560,00:10:22.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So but we'll have to think about how to solve a least squares problem in a bunch of
Dialogue: 0,00:10:22.640,00:10:29.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,numbers. So for example if I want to say I want to minimize the distance. We're going
Dialogue: 0,00:10:29.140,00:10:34.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,to define what the distance should be before or a little bit later. Between the distance
Dialogue: 0,00:10:34.560,00:10:41.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,between any function f and x for all x in the linear space, x. Right so if we want to solve that minimization problem.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:41.680,00:10:42.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right so if we want to solve that minimization problem.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:42.680,00:10:43.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:43.680,00:10:52.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,minimization problem. It's pretty tricky because I'm minimizing over a function space that I don't
Dialogue: 0,00:10:52.800,00:11:02.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,know how to choose. But I can transform that minimization problem because any x in x can be
Dialogue: 0,00:11:02.560,00:11:10.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,represented as a linear combination. I can minimize over all the possible a's that is in Rn,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:10.040,00:11:21.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,right? So if the basis has n entries, the distance between f and that linear combination
Dialogue: 0,00:11:21.000,00:11:32.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,of xi. So I know I'm minimizing over a space of n numbers, and that is something I can solve
Dialogue: 0,00:11:32.500,00:11:39.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,with the computer. So that's why basis is useful, okay?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:40.040,00:11:45.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now let's discuss... Yeah?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:45.720,00:12:02.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's a good question. What if the basis is not finite? Actually, for some function spaces,
Dialogue: 0,00:12:02.360,00:12:09.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,the basis is infinite. For example, you can simply choose x to be all functions that are
Dialogue: 0,00:12:09.560,00:12:10.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,continuous. So if you have a function space that is infinite, and you want to write it as a linear
Dialogue: 0,00:12:10.020,00:12:15.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,continuous, it don't require x to be piecewise linear or anything. In that case, you actually
Dialogue: 0,00:12:15.100,00:12:20.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,cannot find a finite set of basis. You can still have a basis, but the basis is going to be an
Dialogue: 0,00:12:20.880,00:12:27.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,infinite set. It's not a finite set. And in that case, this particular problem cannot be transformed
Dialogue: 0,00:12:27.580,00:12:34.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,into a finite dimensional optimization problem. That is why in finite element, there is this word
Dialogue: 0,00:12:34.340,00:12:39.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,finite, okay? We need to construct...
Dialogue: 0,00:12:40.020,00:12:47.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because the space of functions, as you can see, it's of my choice. I can choose what function space
Dialogue: 0,00:12:47.460,00:12:56.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,I want to operate in. Therefore, I need to choose a function space that I can actually construct
Dialogue: 0,00:12:56.060,00:13:03.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,a finite set of basis. And that enables me to transform any minimization problem. So this is
Dialogue: 0,00:13:03.520,00:13:09.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,just for approximating a function, a known function. I'm going to tell you a little bit later, like,
Dialogue: 0,00:13:09.500,00:13:15.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,how to do the same for approximating an unknown function, which is a solution for PDE using the same
Dialogue: 0,00:13:15.800,00:13:21.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,framework. We are also going to be able to translate that into a finite dimensional optimization problem.
