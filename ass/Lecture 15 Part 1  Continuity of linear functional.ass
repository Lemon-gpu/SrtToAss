Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:04.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Last lecture we put finite element in a more general and rigorous footing.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:06.040,00:00:13.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,We defined finite element as a formulation completely removed from the differential equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:14.880,00:00:21.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,A finite element starts with the weak form of a differential equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:21.180,00:00:37.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,And a weak form is defined by a bilinear functional A equal to a linear functional L for all the possible Vs in the test space XV.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:39.120,00:00:44.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we are finding a solution to this weak form.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:45.620,00:00:51.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,The solution U has to lie in a potentially different space, X.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:51.180,00:00:56.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is generally a weak form of a differential equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:57.480,00:01:04.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we derived the weak form for the Poisson's equation, a second order derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:04.860,00:01:09.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we also derived for an equation with a fourth order derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:10.220,00:01:20.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in both cases, the bilinear functional is the integral of the product of certain derivatives of U and certain derivatives of V.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:21.180,00:01:27.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the linear functional is the integral of the product between the test function V and a known function F.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:28.960,00:01:38.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in this lecture, we'll start from this weak form and analyze some properties of our finite element solutions.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:39.900,00:01:46.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So first of all, we want to analyze the weak form actually is stable and has a unique solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:47.820,00:01:50.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we will derive conditions for this.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:51.180,00:01:55.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we will derive conditions for the weak form that is going to give us a unique solution that is stable.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:55.860,00:02:05.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then we know on the what assumptions we can continue to discuss our finite element to look at how much error our finite element is making.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:06.780,00:02:14.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,The error analysis we are studying in this lecture is quite different from the kind of error analysis we are studying finite difference and finite volume.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:14.920,00:02:19.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because instead of studying the Taylor series analysis, looking at the error in the Taylor series analysis,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:19.360,00:02:20.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,we are studying the Taylor series analysis, looking at the error in the Taylor series analysis,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:20.960,00:02:21.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,we are studying the Taylor series expansion.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:22.760,00:02:32.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,We are now looking at errors in functional spaces that is removed from like the local type of analysis we have been doing before.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:35.060,00:02:42.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So first of all, let's define the situations in which the finite element, the weak form is actually well defined.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:44.960,00:02:50.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,So a weak form is first of all well defined for the when the functional on the right hand side has two functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:50.340,00:02:50.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So a weak form is first of all well defined for the when the functional on the right hand side has two functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:50.840,00:02:53.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So a weak form is first of all well defined for the when the functional on the right hand side has two functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:53.440,00:02:57.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,So l of v is continuous.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:01.160,00:03:06.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,If and only if, which is the definition of the continuity is that,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:09.020,00:03:16.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,l of v if I take the norm, whatever norm we have on this x v.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:17.560,00:03:20.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Divided by the norm of the v,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:20.840,00:03:32.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,is bounded. So the maximum or supremum of this over the entire space xv has to be less than
Dialogue: 0,00:03:32.380,00:03:40.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,infinity. So the supremum is basically a notion of maximum over infinite possible
Dialogue: 0,00:03:40.700,00:03:48.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,candidates, right? So because the space of xv has infinitely many members,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:48.060,00:03:57.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,so supremum is basically taking the maximum over that space. Or it says that, or equivalently,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:58.620,00:04:12.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,equivalently, there exists a maximum, let's say c, such that the ratio between l of v
Dialogue: 0,00:04:14.220,00:04:18.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the norm of v is less than that c.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:18.060,00:04:23.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,For all the possible v's, right? These two are equivalent.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:26.160,00:04:29.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so this is what we mean by continuity of a linear functional.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:30.180,00:04:37.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's also called bounded, right? So it's bounded because this supremum is actually,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:37.420,00:04:47.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,can be defined as the norm of this l, right? This l have a norm, it's called the induced norm.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:48.060,00:04:57.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's induced because it's induced by the norm of the vector it operates on, right? And the l of v,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:57.160,00:05:03.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,oh sorry, l of v is a number. So the norm it takes is just the norm of the number. So it can be just
Dialogue: 0,00:05:03.780,00:05:09.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,an absolute value. If the result of l of v is a real number, then it's just an absolute value.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:10.080,00:05:16.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let me make this a bit clearer. So l of v is just going to be
Dialogue: 0,00:05:18.060,00:05:27.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,a number. So it's the ratio between the magnitude of l of v divided by the norm of the v, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:27.140,00:05:38.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so let's say, for example, a delta function. A delta function is a linear functional, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:40.080,00:05:44.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's linear because, let's say, example.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:48.060,00:05:59.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,A delta function of x is a linear functional in the sense that
Dialogue: 0,00:05:59.080,00:06:16.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,I can define l of v being integration over a domain, let's say, minus 1 to 1, delta x times v of x dx.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:18.060,00:06:24.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is this linear functional a bounded or continuous linear functional?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:26.080,00:06:30.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,No, we have different answers and all the answers can be correct.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:31.960,00:06:36.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because we haven't defined what space, what this norm is, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:38.240,00:06:44.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you can only answer is it a linear function, is it bounded or not, once you define a space,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:44.880,00:06:48.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,define a space of v. And if you define different spaces, you can only define a space of v.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:48.060,00:06:50.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you define different spaces, the norm on the space is going to be different.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:51.360,00:06:57.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if we are in l2 space, the norm of a function is the integral of the squared function.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:57.940,00:07:03.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,If we are in the sub left space, h1, for example, the norm of the same function becomes different.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:03.780,00:07:08.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,You have to add the integral of the derivative squared into the norm.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:09.140,00:07:17.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's take the simpler case first. If in the l2 space, is this linear functional or bounded?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:18.060,00:07:20.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is this linear functional or bounded?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:20.060,00:07:24.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So somebody answered yes and no, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:24.060,00:07:26.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Who answered yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:26.060,00:07:32.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,And in l2 space, do you still hold your yes answer?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:32.060,00:07:36.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,You think so, okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:36.060,00:07:43.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,And can you give me, so what c do you think can you derive? How would you derive this c?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:43.060,00:07:47.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,The integral of v times x squared of c.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:47.060,00:07:48.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is that right?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:48.060,00:07:51.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So c is equal to v at x equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:51.060,00:07:55.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, but this is for any v, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:55.060,00:08:02.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,We have to get a c, get a bound that holds for any v.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:02.060,00:08:04.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,c equal to 1?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:04.060,00:08:09.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so why do you think c equal to 1 work?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:09.060,00:08:13.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Hmm?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:13.060,00:08:17.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,By Cauchy-Schwarz inequality?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:17.060,00:08:24.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, this is a dot product of two functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:24.060,00:08:33.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,And so if you use Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, you would get less or equal to the same integral of delta x squared dx,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:33.060,00:08:37.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,which I don't know what it is, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:37.060,00:08:39.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Times something else.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:39.060,00:08:41.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I don't think that works.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:41.060,00:08:46.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Actually, if you really look at the square of the delta function integrated,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:46.060,00:08:48.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think you get infinity.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:48.060,00:08:51.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right, think of you get a spike, narrower and narrower,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:51.060,00:08:55.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,whose integral is equal to 1, and you square it.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:55.060,00:09:00.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,You make it like a lot larger than, you make the integral a lot larger than 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:00.060,00:09:03.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:03.060,00:09:07.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Who said no?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:07.060,00:09:09.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Who said no just now?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:09.060,00:09:11.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Did you say no?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:11.060,00:09:14.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So who said this is not a bounded linear function?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:14.060,00:09:15.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,No.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:16.060,00:09:20.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Nobody?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:20.060,00:09:24.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, this is not a bounded linear function of L2.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:24.060,00:09:28.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Why is that the case?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:28.060,00:09:37.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Why is the case is because the value of this linear functional can be arbitrarily large
Dialogue: 0,00:09:37.060,00:09:41.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,for a V whose L2 norm is equal to 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:41.060,00:09:44.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so let me construct this kind of V.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:46.060,00:09:53.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So X, V, okay, I was looking at from minus 1 to 1, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:53.060,00:10:00.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Of course, I can have a function that is equal to,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:00.060,00:10:09.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,let me construct a function that is equal to 1 between minus half and half.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:09.060,00:10:14.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,This function, of course, has, if you square it, it will be the same function,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:14.060,00:10:16.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,and if you integrate it, you get 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:16.060,00:10:20.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the L2 norm of this function is 1, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:20.060,00:10:27.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the linear functional evaluated on this function is going to be the value of this function at 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:27.060,00:10:30.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the linear function is 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:30.060,00:10:33.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,But I can do some tricks.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:33.060,00:10:38.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,What I can do is I can make the value at 0 equal to 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:38.060,00:10:42.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,And just by shrinking,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:42.060,00:10:45.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,by shrinking the area on which it is non-zero to,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:45.060,00:10:50.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,instead of minus half, I have 1 minus 1 eighth and plus 1 eighth.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:50.060,00:10:52.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this function, if you square it,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:52.060,00:10:57.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,you get a value of 4 integrated over a length of 1 fourth.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:57.060,00:10:59.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,You still get the L2 norm of 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:59.060,00:11:02.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,but now I can make the value of the linear functional higher.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:02.060,00:11:04.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I can keep doing this.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:04.060,00:11:09.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I can keep increasing the magnitude of the function at X equal to 0
Dialogue: 0,00:11:09.060,00:11:12.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,and shrink the support,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:12.060,00:11:15.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,shrink the area over which the function is non-zero to,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:15.060,00:11:17.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,so the function is non-zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:17.060,00:11:20.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,But...
Dialogue: 0,00:11:20.060,00:11:25.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, V equal to delta of X is not a proper function, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:25.060,00:11:29.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So basically, you can keep shrinking the support
Dialogue: 0,00:11:29.060,00:11:34.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,so that the V goes closer and closer to something like a delta function.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:34.060,00:11:36.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,And by doing that,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:36.060,00:11:43.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,we are going to get the ratio of L of V over the L2 norm of V
Dialogue: 0,00:11:43.060,00:11:45.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,that is going unbounded,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:45.060,00:11:47.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,and L2 goes to infinity.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:47.060,00:11:49.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have no bound.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:49.060,00:11:55.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,The delta function is not a bounded linear functional in L2.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:55.060,00:12:03.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,But it turns out the delta function is a bounded linear functional in H1.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:03.060,00:12:06.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you define...
Dialogue: 0,00:12:06.060,00:12:13.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So L of V is not continuous
Dialogue: 0,00:12:13.060,00:12:15.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,and bounded and continuous
Dialogue: 0,00:12:15.060,00:12:18.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,for linear functional is the same
Dialogue: 0,00:12:18.060,00:12:20.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,in L2,
Dialogue: 0,00:12:20.060,00:12:22.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,but
Dialogue: 0,00:12:22.060,00:12:26.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,is continuous
Dialogue: 0,00:12:26.060,00:12:29.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,in H1.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:29.060,00:12:32.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay?
Dialogue: 0,00:12:32.060,00:12:35.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the reason is that
Dialogue: 0,00:12:35.060,00:12:37.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,all of these functions I constructed,
Dialogue: 0,00:12:37.060,00:12:39.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,they are not...
Dialogue: 0,00:12:39.060,00:12:41.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you look at...
Dialogue: 0,00:12:41.060,00:12:44.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So first of all, they are not in H1, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:12:44.060,00:12:47.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because they don't have bounded derivatives.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:47.060,00:12:49.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,And even if you try to...
Dialogue: 0,00:12:49.060,00:12:54.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, what if I construct a function that is continuous?
Dialogue: 0,00:12:54.060,00:12:58.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Instead of going from minus 1 to 1 in a sharp way,
Dialogue: 0,00:12:58.060,00:13:00.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,we can go to minus 1 that way,
Dialogue: 0,00:13:00.060,00:13:02.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I can shrink it, go like this.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:02.060,00:13:06.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,But the problem is we have derivatives that is going larger and larger
Dialogue: 0,00:13:06.060,00:13:11.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,when you make the spike going higher and higher.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:11.060,00:13:12.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:13:12.060,00:13:17.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So there is no way you can construct a...
Dialogue: 0,00:13:17.060,00:13:19.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,construct a V
Dialogue: 0,00:13:19.060,00:13:23.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,whose derivatives are still square integrable
Dialogue: 0,00:13:23.060,00:13:29.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,while the value at 0 goes higher and higher.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:29.060,00:13:31.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay?
Dialogue: 0,00:13:31.060,00:13:35.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the proof is a little bit time consuming,
Dialogue: 0,00:13:35.060,00:13:40.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,but you can still get a sense of that by the following.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:40.060,00:13:41.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So first of all,
Dialogue: 0,00:13:41.060,00:13:43.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Lv is...
Dialogue: 0,00:13:43.060,00:13:48.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the H1 norm of V
Dialogue: 0,00:13:48.060,00:13:55.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,is the integral from minus 1 to 1 V square plus dV dx square, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:13:55.060,00:13:57.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,dx.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:57.060,00:13:58.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:13:58.060,00:14:01.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So first of all, the V square term cannot be too large.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:01.060,00:14:03.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So V has to be...
Dialogue: 0,00:14:03.060,00:14:07.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,The mean value of V cannot exceed, let's say, 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:07.060,00:14:09.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:14:09.060,00:14:10.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:10.060,00:14:13.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,The value of V is not going to be too large.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:13.060,00:14:14.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if I...
Dialogue: 0,00:14:14.060,00:14:18.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what I'm saying is if I have a V that is equal to...
Dialogue: 0,00:14:18.060,00:14:20.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,The norm of V is equal to 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:14:20.060,00:14:25.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,okay, I want to show that the value of Lv cannot be...
Dialogue: 0,00:14:25.060,00:14:26.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,go to infinity.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:26.060,00:14:27.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right? So, okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:27.060,00:14:30.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if I have this to be 1, then the mean value of V,
Dialogue: 0,00:14:30.060,00:14:33.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,so this term, has to be less or equal to 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:33.060,00:14:36.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this term also has to be less or equal to 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:36.060,00:14:38.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if this term is less or equal to 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:14:38.060,00:14:40.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,then the slope cannot be too large.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:40.060,00:14:43.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you have a function whose mean value cannot be too large
Dialogue: 0,00:14:43.060,00:14:45.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,and slope cannot be too large.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:45.060,00:14:47.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the point...
Dialogue: 0,00:14:47.060,00:14:50.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the value of the function at 0 also cannot be too large.
