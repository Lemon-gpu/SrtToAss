Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:05.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,If we use a lambda that is greater than 1, what's going to happen?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:06.120,00:00:08.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,What do you think is going to happen to the iteration?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:11.800,00:00:17.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,It'll diverge exactly because I get an eigenvalue that has magnitude greater than 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:18.340,00:00:24.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, very, very close to 1, if you exceed 1 even by a little bit, the iteration is going to diverge.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:24.460,00:00:24.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,Not good.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:24.980,00:00:32.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,But if you make lambda to be smaller than 1, let's say 0.6, if you make it 0.5,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:32.360,00:00:40.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,it'll be the slow converging negative eigenvalue is now going to be the fastest converging eigenvalue, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:41.440,00:00:46.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, it gets rid of the slow convergence of the oscillatory modes.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:48.540,00:00:51.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, what does it do to this one?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:52.940,00:00:54.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,What does under-relaxation...
Dialogue: 0,00:00:54.980,00:01:00.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,What does under-relaxation do to the slowly converging smooth eigenmode?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:02.040,00:01:02.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:02.800,00:01:03.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,Pretty much nothing.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:04.520,00:01:05.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Pretty much nothing?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:06.720,00:01:10.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, I mean, it puts it closer to 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:10.820,00:01:13.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes, it puts it closer to 1, that's right.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:13.860,00:01:16.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,And what's the effect of putting it closer to 1?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:17.300,00:01:20.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, yeah, at 1, it's about 0.98.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:20.640,00:01:23.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,At 0.5, it'll be 0.99, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:24.760,00:01:24.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:24.900,00:01:24.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:25.100,00:01:28.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,And it'll be even slower convergence, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:30.520,00:01:39.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, if you just apply Jacobi iteration without multigrid, it's smarter to just use lambda equal to 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:39.540,00:01:41.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Just use the original Jacobi iteration.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:42.100,00:01:48.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,But with multigrid, because this mode, we shouldn't really worry about this mode,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:48.820,00:01:51.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,because this mode is handled by the cosigrids.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:51.500,00:01:54.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, it's a lot smarter to use a lambda.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:55.080,00:01:58.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,That is less than 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:59.980,00:02:04.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, let's see it again.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:05.480,00:02:15.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, if I am close, I'm sure of you, that's the solution we get if we don't do any under-relaxation on Jacobi.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:16.260,00:02:16.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:18.900,00:02:21.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,And now, let's do an under-relaxation on Jacobi.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:24.960,00:02:28.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,On the paper, it looks pretty complicated, but here, it's pretty easy.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:28.840,00:02:35.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, I do 0.5 times U0 plus 0.5 times Jacobi, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:36.440,00:02:40.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, under-relaxation factor lambda equal to 0.5 is just that easy to implement.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:41.760,00:02:45.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I'll also do it on the post-smoothing.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:49.780,00:02:51.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'll paste it here.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:51.960,00:02:54.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, this is the under-relaxation factor of 0.5.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:54.880,00:03:00.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,If I want to do it as 0.7, I'll just make 0.7 here, and what will be here?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:01.660,00:03:02.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,0.3, yes.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:04.920,00:03:05.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Hmm?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:07.200,00:03:08.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, it should be U1. Thank you.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:09.520,00:03:09.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:10.660,00:03:11.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,We are done.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:13.180,00:03:18.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, let's initialize this to 0 again.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:20.040,00:03:21.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,Multi-grid of U.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:21.180,00:03:24.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,Those, I'm sure of you.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:24.880,00:03:26.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:26.680,00:03:30.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,We get what solution we got yesterday.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:31.820,00:03:32.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:33.240,00:03:41.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, basically, by doing under-relaxation, we can fix the problem of Jacobi iteration of not being a good smoother.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:43.660,00:03:50.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,The reason Gauss-Seidel didn't have this problem and did not require under-relaxation is because
Dialogue: 0,00:03:50.520,00:03:54.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,Gauss-Seidel actually didn't have this very close to minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:54.880,00:03:57.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,What is this?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:57.180,00:04:01.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,This one in the manual is ve x e x e .
Dialogue: 0,00:04:01.640,00:04:03.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,z and t.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:03.880,00:04:05.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is the median.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:05.380,00:04:06.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, we're trying to simplify this somewhere.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:06.820,00:04:08.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Hopefully, this is the formula as shown.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:08.260,00:04:09.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,No.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:09.580,00:04:14.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,All that's missing is the larger's unit, which was in the entry value, but also inside.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:14.980,00:04:17.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, we are done.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:17.100,00:04:19.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, then we have a next edge objet�로
Dialogue: 0,00:04:21.360,00:04:22.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,A白 dot comma r吃 j q.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:22.660,00:04:23.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,aka k last x 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:23.700,00:04:24.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:24.240,00:04:24.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:24.580,00:04:29.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,instead of looking at these two it will be looking at this red one and these two
Dialogue: 0,00:04:29.200,00:04:33.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,so it'll be draw a straight line over here the second one is gonna be here
Dialogue: 0,00:04:33.520,00:04:39.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,instead of drawing a straight line between these two grid points it'll draw
Dialogue: 0,00:04:39.120,00:04:41.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,a straight line between these two because it's using the most up-to-date
Dialogue: 0,00:04:41.760,00:04:47.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,value so it'll be here and it'll be here so this mode that converges very slowly
Dialogue: 0,00:04:47.320,00:04:54.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,for Jacobi is not converging very slowly for Gauss-Seidel right and we Gauss-Seidel
Dialogue: 0,00:04:54.400,00:05:00.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,does not have an under-relaxation, that does not have an eigenvalue close to
Dialogue: 0,00:05:00.700,00:05:08.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,minus 1 and for Gauss-Seidel we can even apply the over relaxation so
Dialogue: 0,00:05:08.200,00:05:17.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,for example if we do Gauss-Seidel here we can even do a 1.2 here and make it
Dialogue: 0,00:05:17.080,00:05:24.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,minus two point minus 0.2 on the on the one minus lambda
Dialogue: 0,00:05:24.300,00:05:32.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,part so this is lambda if lambda is equal to 1.2 then 1 minus lambda is equal to minus 0.2 right so
Dialogue: 0,00:05:32.500,00:05:33.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,that'll still work
Dialogue: 0,00:05:33.880,00:05:44.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,so it still gives us a good solution even if we do
Dialogue: 0,00:05:45.660,00:05:51.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,over relaxation on gauss-seidel because the the smallest eigenvalue it's very tricky to analyze
Dialogue: 0,00:05:51.620,00:05:57.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,but like you show it is the smallest eigenvalue it's still a little bit away from minus 1
Dialogue: 0,00:05:57.980,00:06:04.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,so it's okay to to use the over relaxation to push it even further towards minus 1
Dialogue: 0,00:06:04.860,00:06:12.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,with the benefit of perhaps moving the largest eigenvalue a little bit further away from 1
Dialogue: 0,00:06:12.680,00:06:16.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,so the convergence is a little bit faster all right
Dialogue: 0,00:06:16.840,00:06:21.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,okay any questions on the
Dialogue: 0,00:06:21.280,00:06:21.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,you
Dialogue: 0,00:06:21.620,00:06:25.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,effect of iterations on smoothing
Dialogue: 0,00:06:25.260,00:06:32.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,and if you apply multigrade to your own problem for example
Dialogue: 0,00:06:32.200,00:06:40.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,and you find it not converging very well or diverging even it's probably the the smoothing
Dialogue: 0,00:06:40.340,00:06:49.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,is a very is is you should look at the smoothing and especially pre-smoothing if you if you make
Dialogue: 0,00:06:49.720,00:06:51.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,this uh uh
Dialogue: 0,00:06:51.280,00:07:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so so for some very tough problems you five pre-smoothing iterations may not be enough you may have to do 10 even 20
Dialogue: 0,00:07:00.000,00:07:16.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,basically to make the residual you compute to be smooth enough so that this interpolation you are doing here is not going to give you a completely bogus uh residual right
Dialogue: 0,00:07:16.940,00:07:20.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,okay so so if you
Dialogue: 0,00:07:21.280,00:07:30.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,If your total residual hole rod is not actually paling above the final Celsius then you just model the w strip so you are 두ゆžiöng

Dialogue: 0,00:07:57.640,00:07:59.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,It may lead to divergence of multigrid
Dialogue: 0,00:07:59.880,00:08:05.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,if the smoothing didn't make the residual to be smooth.
