Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:05.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now we finished defining physics number one, I can move on to the mesh node.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:05.500,00:00:10.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,There is always going to be a default mesh. If I click on build all, it will build me a mesh.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:10.300,00:00:15.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I could actually look at the details by right-click and edit physics-induced sequence.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:15.500,00:00:23.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in this case, this particular free tetrahedral mesh was generated with the sequence with some predefined level of normal.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:23.000,00:00:27.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,You could, you know, further refine it or make it coarser.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:27.000,00:00:35.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,You could also more accurately control it via the custom option and define what's the maximum, minimum mesh size,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:35.000,00:00:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and also what is the growth rate and curvature.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:38.000,00:00:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,If there's narrow region, how many layers on average you want to have in terms of mesh in that narrow region.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:44.000,00:00:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in this case, it's a uniform size everywhere in the entire domain.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:48.000,00:00:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,But of course, we know that's not always the most effective way or efficient way of meshing.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:54.000,00:00:57.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,For example, if you do have a high gradient close to a certain,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:57.000,00:01:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,surface, we know that there is a lot of say like electric double layer in that region and the concentration gradient is really high.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:04.000,00:01:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then what happens is you do want to further refine the mesh close to that particular surface.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:10.000,00:01:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in that case, I could add a size node under the free tetrahedral and choose the size node to control on the boundary level.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:18.000,00:01:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the levels here are domain 3D boundary, in this case is 2D and 1D and 0D for the adjunct point.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:25.000,00:01:27.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Of course, you have a different definition.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:27.000,00:01:29.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you can have a different definition of domain where you have a 2D geometry.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:29.000,00:01:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then the boundary is actually an edge.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:32.000,00:01:37.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in this case, we're going to say I want to refine the mesh close to this boundary number 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:37.000,00:01:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I want to use the extra fine mesh here.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:40.000,00:01:45.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you see that the mesh around the surface is actually refined.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:45.000,00:01:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Of course, you can see even better with the further refine.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:48.000,00:01:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then you can change that to mesh size node as well.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:52.000,00:01:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is the mesh number 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:54.000,00:01:55.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you do say,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:55.000,00:01:57.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I know this geometry is actually,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:57.000,00:01:58.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,extrusion geometry,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:58.000,00:02:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so it has the same thickness everywhere.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:00.000,00:02:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,What if I want to use a different mesh type?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:02.000,00:02:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you can right click on a component 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:04.000,00:02:05.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,add a different mesh.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:05.000,00:02:07.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now you have mesh number 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:07.000,00:02:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Say I actually want to use a free,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:10.000,00:02:15.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,let's do a free triangular mesh on the side surface.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:15.000,00:02:21.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then I could add a swept mesh for the domain.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:21.000,00:02:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And for the sweeping,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:22.000,00:02:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I want a distribution of 10 layers.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:25.000,00:02:27.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So why is this useful?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:27.000,00:02:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you do have a high gradient in the y direction,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:30.000,00:02:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and less gradient in the x and z direction,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:32.000,00:02:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so this way it allows the mesh to be,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:34.000,00:02:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,element to be still very reasonable,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:36.000,00:02:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,only, you know, 480 domain elements.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:38.000,00:02:41.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,But meanwhile, you have much better resolution in the y direction.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:41.000,00:02:43.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if there is a high gradient,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:43.000,00:02:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,you can resolve it.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:44.000,00:02:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And also, when you have a very thin structure,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:46.000,00:02:49.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,then you do not want to use too fine a mesh that's combined,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:49.000,00:02:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,confined by the,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:50.000,00:02:51.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:51.000,00:02:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:52.000,00:02:53.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:53.000,00:02:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:54.000,00:02:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,confined by the smallest dimension you have.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:56.000,00:02:57.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,In this way,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:57.000,00:03:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,you can actually match the thin structure fairly well.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:00.000,00:03:03.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And meanwhile, keep the mesh element size
Dialogue: 0,00:03:03.000,00:03:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,on the other dimensions reasonable.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:06.000,00:03:07.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:07.000,00:03:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So just the,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:08.000,00:03:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the other mesh options,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:10.000,00:03:13.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,of course, are available through the right click of the mesh as well.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:13.000,00:03:15.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you see, for fluid flow,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:15.000,00:03:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,one of the very useful features is a boundary layer mesh.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:18.000,00:03:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So especially when turbulence happens,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:20.000,00:03:21.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,you do want to resolve the wall regions,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:21.000,00:03:23.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the close to the wall,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:23.000,00:03:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,you know,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:24.000,00:03:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the boundary layer mesh.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:25.000,00:03:27.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And you can also use the boundary layer mesh to
Dialogue: 0,00:03:27.000,00:03:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,find the boundary layer mesh.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:28.000,00:03:31.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's where you can define the boundary layer mesh and specify how many layers you want,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:31.000,00:03:33.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,how much do they stretch per layer,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:33.000,00:03:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,adjacent layer,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:34.000,00:03:37.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then what is the initial layer thickness.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:37.000,00:03:39.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it is actually a default option.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:39.000,00:03:45.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,We have a fluid flow physics and the default mesh controlled physics would have the boundary layer added already.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:45.000,00:03:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:46.000,00:03:47.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's about the mesh.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:47.000,00:03:49.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then we can look at a study.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:49.000,00:03:51.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So right now there is a study,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:51.000,00:03:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,step one,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:52.000,00:03:53.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,stationary,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:53.000,00:03:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and stationary solver.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:54.000,00:03:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you do want to look at a solver settings,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:56.000,00:03:58.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,you can show default solver.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:58.000,00:04:01.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,We can expand it and see that's the dependent variable we're solving for.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:01.000,00:04:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,We know that in the model wizard,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:04.000,00:04:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the component one dot V,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:06.000,00:04:07.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,uppercase V,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:07.000,00:04:09.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we're just directly uppercase V.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:09.000,00:04:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's the actual potential.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:10.000,00:04:12.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's a stationary solver we're using.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:12.000,00:04:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,There is a relative tolerance that's been specified here.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:16.000,00:04:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,There is,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:18.000,00:04:19.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,you can,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:19.000,00:04:21.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,whether to show the results while the solver is moving.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:21.000,00:04:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's actually useful
Dialogue: 0,00:04:22.000,00:04:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,when you have a longer computational time
Dialogue: 0,00:04:25.000,00:04:27.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and you can see what's the current solution
Dialogue: 0,00:04:27.000,00:04:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,without waiting until the end.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:30.000,00:04:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,There is a,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:32.000,00:04:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,let's see what other things you need to know.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:34.000,00:04:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The fully coupled solver is the one that's being used right now.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:38.000,00:04:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's using a linear solver of iterative solver
Dialogue: 0,00:04:42.000,00:04:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and more iterative solver details right here.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:44.000,00:04:47.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's a multigrid solver with some pre-smoother,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:47.000,00:04:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,post-smoother,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:48.000,00:04:49.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and core-smoother.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:49.000,00:04:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So most of the time you don't have to change the default solver.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:52.000,00:04:53.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Especially so far as you know,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:53.000,00:04:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,this is a linear problem.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:54.000,00:04:57.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we know already that it's going to solve in one iteration.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:57.000,00:04:59.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,All linear problems solving in one iteration
Dialogue: 0,00:04:59.000,00:05:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,because you go down a tangent
Dialogue: 0,00:05:00.000,00:05:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and you go through the straight line
Dialogue: 0,00:05:02.000,00:05:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and you find that solution
Dialogue: 0,00:05:04.000,00:05:07.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,or error estimates to the minimum
Dialogue: 0,00:05:07.000,00:05:09.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,directly through that one iteration.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:09.000,00:05:11.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's a mump solver that's being used now.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:11.000,00:05:13.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The other direct solver includes the
Dialogue: 0,00:05:13.000,00:05:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Parisol, Spools, and Dense Matrix solvers.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:16.000,00:05:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And let's see what else.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:18.000,00:05:21.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So basically a lot of times you do want to,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:21.000,00:05:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the nonlinear method is a Newton-Raphson iteration.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:25.000,00:05:27.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you already know that.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:27.000,00:05:29.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's see.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:29.000,00:05:31.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I would say the tolerance,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:31.000,00:05:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the termination technique right now is by default
Dialogue: 0,00:05:34.000,00:05:35.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,is set to be tolerance.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:35.000,00:05:39.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So basically you can choose between tolerance or iterations.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:39.000,00:05:43.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So either, for example, terminates after 25 iterations
Dialogue: 0,00:05:43.000,00:05:47.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,or when the tolerance criteria is met.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:47.000,00:05:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the two concepts here is the relative tolerance
Dialogue: 0,00:05:50.000,00:05:51.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the nonlinear.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:51.000,00:05:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then the absolute tolerance.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:52.000,00:05:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the loser of the two is going to be in effect.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:54.000,00:05:57.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then when you do want to refine the solution,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:57.000,00:05:59.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,you do want to refine, for example,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:59.000,00:06:01.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,type of extra zero here,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:01.000,00:06:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,you know, to tighten the tolerances.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:04.000,00:06:07.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,But of course that comes at a cost of
Dialogue: 0,00:06:07.000,00:06:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,more computational cost.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:10.000,00:06:13.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's always a balance between the two.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:13.000,00:06:15.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in this case we all know it's going to solve.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:15.000,00:06:19.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we're going to right click on study one and hit compute.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:19.000,00:06:21.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So here it shows the program.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:21.000,00:06:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And here it shows how much physical memory
Dialogue: 0,00:06:24.000,00:06:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the virtual memory that's in use.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:26.000,00:06:29.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And now we solve for the potential, how it disputes.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:29.000,00:06:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,By default comes already generated a plot group for me.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:32.000,00:06:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Just to show you how this works,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:34.000,00:06:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,you can always right click on results,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:36.000,00:06:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,add a 3D plot group.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:38.000,00:06:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And in the 3D plot group,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:40.000,00:06:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,you can add any type of a plot
Dialogue: 0,00:06:42.000,00:06:45.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,that you think would be able to nicely visualize this.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:45.000,00:06:47.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,For example, instead of the slice plots,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:47.000,00:06:49.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the multi-slice plot,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:49.000,00:06:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I could do a single slice.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:50.000,00:06:55.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,In the, let's do a xy plane.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:55.000,00:06:57.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Actually a yz plane.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:57.000,00:06:59.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And just one slice.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:59.000,00:07:01.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is how the potential looks like
Dialogue: 0,00:07:01.000,00:07:03.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,in the cross-section.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:03.000,00:07:05.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I could make the slice interactive
Dialogue: 0,00:07:05.000,00:07:07.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and basically just scan through the geometry
Dialogue: 0,00:07:07.000,00:07:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,to see what is the local potential distribution.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:10.000,00:07:13.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,You could also do like a,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:13.000,00:07:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,just a cross-section xz plane
Dialogue: 0,00:07:16.000,00:07:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,of one slice.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:18.000,00:07:19.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that shows the total.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:19.000,00:07:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that shows you where the potential goes from 0
Dialogue: 0,00:07:22.000,00:07:23.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,to the other end,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:23.000,00:07:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the higher end, 0.2 volts.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:25.000,00:07:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,On top of the slice plot,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:26.000,00:07:29.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,you could also add, for example, an arrow volume.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:29.000,00:07:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to use the arrows to show how the current flows.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:32.000,00:07:37.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to use maybe 20 points in the x direction,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:37.000,00:07:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,just one point in the y direction,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:40.000,00:07:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and 10 points in the z direction.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:42.000,00:07:45.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now I have the arrows flowing from the high potential end
Dialogue: 0,00:07:45.000,00:07:47.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,to the low potential end.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:47.000,00:07:49.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The direction of the arrow, of course,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:49.000,00:07:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,is where the density goes, the current flows.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:52.000,00:07:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then the length of the arrow
Dialogue: 0,00:07:54.000,00:07:57.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,is actually proportional to what is the local density.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:57.000,00:07:59.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,There is some singularity around the shoulders
Dialogue: 0,00:07:59.000,00:08:01.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,because of the sharp transition.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:01.000,00:08:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The electric currents cannot make a perfect sharp turn
Dialogue: 0,00:08:04.000,00:08:07.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,because the divergence has to equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:07.000,00:08:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you can also, for example,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:10.000,00:08:13.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,add on top of the arrow volume a color expression.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:13.000,00:08:17.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Say use the color to represent what's the current density.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:17.000,00:08:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you can type in a replace expression
Dialogue: 0,00:08:20.000,00:08:23.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and find the current density norm.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:23.000,00:08:27.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now the color actually shows what's the magnitude.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:27.000,00:08:29.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,You can change the color table
Dialogue: 0,00:08:29.000,00:08:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so that it doesn't mix with the other one.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:32.000,00:08:35.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So different visualizations you can do.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:35.000,00:08:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any questions?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:38.000,00:08:41.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,What we have done so far with the single physics problem?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:41.000,00:08:45.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
