Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:05.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so the third limiting case is hyperbolic equations. So that is when
Dialogue: 0,00:00:05.800,00:00:14.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,Kappa, what we take as the primary driver for the spatial derivative to 0, we also
Dialogue: 0,00:00:14.520,00:00:21.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,take f equal to 0. We have the equation partial u partial t plus a big U
Dialogue: 0,00:00:21.420,00:00:31.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,partial u partial x equal to 0. This equation has a very interesting
Dialogue: 0,00:00:31.660,00:00:41.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,analytical solution and let's just draw it from MATLAB. So if I, for example, if I
Dialogue: 0,00:00:41.220,00:00:49.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,take Kappa equal to 0 and big U equal to 1. So I'd like to have somebody again to
Dialogue: 0,00:00:49.340,00:00:51.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,draw an initial condition and see how the solution
Dialogue: 0,00:00:51.400,00:00:59.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,evolves. Can we have somebody to draw an initial condition again?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:05.680,00:01:08.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, please.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:17.680,00:01:21.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right, thanks. So this is the solution to
Dialogue: 0,00:01:21.380,00:01:29.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,the case where U is equal to 1 and Kappa is equal to 0. What we see is a linear
Dialogue: 0,00:01:29.300,00:01:35.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,translation. The solution keeps the original shape but just translates
Dialogue: 0,00:01:35.960,00:01:47.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,towards the right. Can we analyze that also from the differential equation itself?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:51.380,00:02:01.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,We can put Fourier analysis again. That's right. So let's express U again as a function
Dialogue: 0,00:02:01.380,00:02:10.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,of x and t using a summation. I'm going to not write K. It goes from minus infinity to
Dialogue: 0,00:02:10.940,00:02:17.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,infinity. And then the spatial derivative is going to be operated on. So this is the
Dialogue: 0,00:02:17.660,00:02:18.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:18.660,00:02:19.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:19.660,00:02:20.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:20.660,00:02:21.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:21.660,00:02:22.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:22.660,00:02:23.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then the spatial derivative is going to be operated on U .
Dialogue: 0,00:02:23.660,00:02:34.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we get an i k in front of this. And the time derivative is going to be operated on
Dialogue: 0,00:02:34.920,00:02:41.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,U only. And we get this.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:41.100,00:02:44.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:44.340,00:02:48.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the solution we get is d U hat of K d t.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:48.940,00:03:13.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,d t plus i k big U times U hat of K is equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:13.940,00:03:16.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:16.940,00:03:17.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Also...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:17.940,00:03:18.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:18.940,00:03:19.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,This equation has the same...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:19.940,00:03:24.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is another ordinary differential equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:24.440,00:03:29.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the form of this equation is exactly the same as what we have been seeing before.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:29.940,00:03:40.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,It is U hat of K is equal to U hat of K at time 0 times e to the minus i k t...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:40.940,00:03:42.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,i k t...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:42.940,00:03:43.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,i k u t.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:43.940,00:03:44.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, i k u t.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:44.940,00:03:45.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, i k u t.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:45.940,00:03:46.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, i k u t.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:46.940,00:03:47.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, i k u t.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:47.940,00:03:48.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, i k u t.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:48.940,00:03:49.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, i k u t.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:49.940,00:03:50.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, i k u t.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:50.940,00:03:51.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, I k u t.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:51.940,00:03:52.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, I k u t.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:52.940,00:03:53.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, i k u t.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:53.940,00:03:54.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, i k u t.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:54.940,00:03:55.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, i k u t.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:56.940,00:04:01.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,So how does this solution look like?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:01.940,00:04:08.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's a sinusoidal oscillation.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:08.140,00:04:09.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:09.440,00:04:12.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the solution for every component oscillates in a sinusoidal way.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:12.940,00:04:14.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,We will have several thousand ways, two ways to swinging parall uniforms.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:14.940,00:04:15.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,And so it's in sin��릴 Agriculture.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:15.940,00:04:16.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's shaftics.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:16.940,00:04:29.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the period of the oscillation is going to be it's going to be 2 pi over
Dialogue: 0,00:04:29.980,00:04:41.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,uk right so the higher the k the smaller the period is and if you can decompose
Dialogue: 0,00:04:41.340,00:04:45.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,the solution into different Fourier modes the different Fourier modes would
Dialogue: 0,00:04:45.020,00:04:54.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,oscillate periodically in different rates and the higher the the slower variation in space is going
Dialogue: 0,00:04:54.780,00:05:03.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,to also oscillate with slower frequencies in time and the composition of all these oscillations
Dialogue: 0,00:05:04.780,00:05:07.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,forms a linear translation in space
Dialogue: 0,00:05:10.700,00:05:13.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,so in fact you can another way to analyze this
Dialogue: 0,00:05:14.540,00:05:14.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,is
Dialogue: 0,00:05:15.020,00:05:31.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,is the fact that this u of x and k x and t can always be written as a function of g of x minus u
Dialogue: 0,00:05:31.820,00:05:41.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,times t when you take the derivative of this function with respect with respect to time
Dialogue: 0,00:05:41.020,00:05:44.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,so
Dialogue: 0,00:05:44.540,00:05:49.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,you get minus u times g prime the derivative of g
Dialogue: 0,00:05:49.660,00:05:55.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,you take the same derivative to x you get just a g prime the summation of these two
Dialogue: 0,00:05:55.260,00:06:03.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,where the space derivative is multiplied by u is going to give you zero so this kind of solution is
Dialogue: 0,00:06:03.260,00:06:09.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,exactly a linear translation in time okay so now we're going to look at the next step
Dialogue: 0,00:06:09.420,00:06:11.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is the derivative of g prime
Dialogue: 0,00:06:11.740,00:06:14.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,so we're going to look at the next step which is the derivative of g prime
Dialogue: 0,00:06:14.540,00:06:21.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,so these are the three Leibniz cases of this convection diffusion equation
Dialogue: 0,00:06:22.940,00:06:29.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,and all of these cases can be analyzed pretty easily using analytical methods
Dialogue: 0,00:06:31.260,00:06:35.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the combination of them becomes quite interesting for example
Dialogue: 0,00:06:35.020,00:06:43.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,if i put a big u of one and cup of point one what do you think you're going to see when i do an initial condition
Dialogue: 0,00:06:44.540,00:06:52.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,if i put a big u of one and cup of point one what do you think you're going to see when i do an initial condition
Dialogue: 0,00:06:52.940,00:06:57.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,so it'll be a translation and gradually becomes a constant let's see that
Dialogue: 0,00:07:01.260,00:07:09.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,okay that's perfectly right there is a advection towards the right but during that action
Dialogue: 0,00:07:09.100,00:07:13.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,it becomes smoother and smoother and ultimately becomes a constant
Dialogue: 0,00:07:14.540,00:07:24.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we can try different things we can put it as 0.01 and we should see the same speed of translation but
Dialogue: 0,00:07:26.220,00:07:30.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,the speed where it goes to a constant should be decreased
Dialogue: 0,00:07:31.900,00:07:37.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,so we can see that now it maintains this oscillatory wave for a bit longer
Dialogue: 0,00:07:39.740,00:07:43.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,and when we draw a different u
Dialogue: 0,00:07:44.540,00:07:52.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,a u of equal to 10 for example what should we see in this case
Dialogue: 0,00:07:52.140,00:08:01.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,i'm trying to draw the same initial condition we see the translation becomes a lot faster right
Dialogue: 0,00:08:03.260,00:08:05.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,what if we draw a negative u in this case
Dialogue: 0,00:08:07.980,00:08:11.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,minus two what do you think is going to happen
Dialogue: 0,00:08:14.540,00:08:19.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,so we can see that the translation goes towards the left
Dialogue: 0,00:08:19.260,00:08:21.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,so we can see that the translation goes towards the left
Dialogue: 0,00:08:21.420,00:08:25.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,okay and i think you had a question what if we put a negative kappa
Dialogue: 0,00:08:25.740,00:08:29.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,let's try that minus 0.1
Dialogue: 0,00:08:32.700,00:08:38.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,huh oh didn't even allow me to draw this that shouldn't happen
Dialogue: 0,00:08:38.220,00:08:40.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,let me see
Dialogue: 0,00:08:40.220,00:08:42.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,okay
Dialogue: 0,00:08:44.540,00:08:46.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,let's try this
Dialogue: 0,00:08:46.540,00:08:48.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,okay
Dialogue: 0,00:08:48.540,00:08:50.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,uh oh
Dialogue: 0,00:08:50.540,00:08:59.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,that's what happens when you have a instability okay so so things becomes
Dialogue: 0,00:08:59.100,00:09:05.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,okay so let's try that
Dialogue: 0,00:09:05.100,00:09:09.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,like that
Dialogue: 0,00:09:09.100,00:09:14.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,i never tried it so let's see how it goes
Dialogue: 0,00:09:14.540,00:09:18.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,so i do see something before it goes
Dialogue: 0,00:09:18.540,00:09:22.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,before it goes to infinity so okay the thing to remember is that
Dialogue: 0,00:09:22.540,00:09:26.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,this minus point whatever how many zeros one is multiplied by k
Dialogue: 0,00:09:26.540,00:09:30.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,square and k when you discretize
Dialogue: 0,00:09:30.540,00:09:34.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,when you discretize a condition of k
Dialogue: 0,00:09:34.540,00:09:38.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,you can see that the function of k is the same as the function of k
Dialogue: 0,00:09:38.540,00:09:42.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,so if you have a condition of k and you have a condition of k
Dialogue: 0,00:09:42.540,00:09:48.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,then you discretize a continuous signal using fourier series
Dialogue: 0,00:09:48.940,00:09:56.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,but the largest k can be pretty large right so so let's say if you have if you
Dialogue: 0,00:09:56.620,00:09:59.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,have a thousand grid points distributed across the spatial domain
Dialogue: 0,00:09:59.100,00:10:01.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,from zero to two pi
Dialogue: 0,00:10:01.100,00:10:05.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,then the largest k can be on the order of like a thousand
Dialogue: 0,00:10:05.820,00:10:06.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,and this thing no matter how small is multiplied by k square and for the
Dialogue: 0,00:10:06.540,00:10:12.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,mean- 언�straight lines this thing no matter how small is multiplied by k square and for the
Dialogue: 0,00:10:12.140,00:10:12.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,mean- 언�estraight lines this thing no matter how small is multiplied by k square and for the
Dialogue: 0,00:10:12.540,00:10:17.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,the largest k even though this one is small you should expect to have a very
Dialogue: 0,00:10:17.160,00:10:22.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,fast divergence to infinity.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:25.580,00:10:34.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's a good point if we have a very smooth initial signal. Oh I think I may
Dialogue: 0,00:10:34.340,00:10:42.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,not be able to draw it smoothly exactly at the boundaries. Sorry I think
Dialogue: 0,00:10:42.220,00:10:48.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,because it's periodic so usually the discontinuity at the boundary is going
Dialogue: 0,00:10:48.580,00:10:52.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,to introduce some high frequency components even though I draw it very
Dialogue: 0,00:10:52.180,00:10:56.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,very carefully so it's pretty difficult.
