Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:12.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,and what happens next is a is the interpolation of the solution of the
Dialogue: 0,00:00:12.260,00:00:17.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,solution which is the correction I should have on the final grid solution
Dialogue: 0,00:00:17.240,00:00:22.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,back to the final grid so that's what we are doing here we complete the solution
Dialogue: 0,00:00:22.500,00:00:29.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we add the correction to the previous solution you 0 so let's see
Dialogue: 0,00:00:29.640,00:00:36.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,what the addition is previously my u 0
Dialogue: 0,00:00:37.460,00:00:46.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,my u 0 is an array like that and the D u F is an array like that so adding them
Dialogue: 0,00:00:46.440,00:00:52.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,together my u 1 is going to be basically this plus this so so
Dialogue: 0,00:00:52.500,00:00:57.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,this array has the smoother features and this array has the less smooth
Dialogue: 0,00:00:57.540,00:01:03.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,features of the solution so adding them together I have the u 1 and after a few
Dialogue: 0,00:01:03.960,00:01:10.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,post smoothing iterations my u 1 is going to be even more improved right so
Dialogue: 0,00:01:10.820,00:01:16.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,it basically what this post smoothing iteration do is it it removes the error
Dialogue: 0,00:01:16.920,00:01:21.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,that comes from interpolating the D u from the causal grid to the final grid
Dialogue: 0,00:01:21.500,00:01:22.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,the interpolation of the solution so that's what we are doing here so this
Dialogue: 0,00:01:22.480,00:01:29.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,interpolation is going to make an error all right okay so if we continue my next
Dialogue: 0,00:01:29.240,00:01:37.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,time I'm going to come back to line 22 okay here is
Dialogue: 0,00:01:43.240,00:01:51.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,what happened oh because it's doing the iterations I shouldn't put it here okay
Dialogue: 0,00:01:51.600,00:01:52.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,continue I
Dialogue: 0,00:01:52.480,00:01:57.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm going to come back to line 22 on the on the course on the final grade so let
Dialogue: 0,00:01:57.200,00:02:06.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,me go back a few times to see how the image is going to change so now we are
Dialogue: 0,00:02:06.080,00:02:12.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,at an interval equal to 16 let's go back to and let's go to a more final
Dialogue: 0,00:02:12.520,00:02:21.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,grid okay 128 okay so let's stop over here and look at what's the effect of the
Dialogue: 0,00:02:21.240,00:02:27.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,little line hours over here so what's the effect of the interpolated iteration
Dialogue: 0,00:02:27.780,00:02:30.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,I left in the horizontal line and I left it to the horizontal line for the first
Dialogue: 0,00:02:30.960,00:02:34.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,example okay you can see here with that this is actually our partial uncial
Dialogue: 0,00:02:34.480,00:02:37.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,요 and I didn't show it but the salvation has capped its error to Kang
Dialogue: 0,00:02:37.440,00:02:39.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,okay so now we're done with our interpolation and our isolations so
Dialogue: 0,00:02:39.740,00:02:42.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to change something um let me
Dialogue: 0,00:02:42.720,00:02:47.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,show you how that looks like okay so this is my initial beautification this is
Dialogue: 0,00:02:47.380,00:02:50.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,you can see here's the ghost Oddland where we are in our Π user and this you
Dialogue: 0,00:02:50.680,00:02:52.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,solutions, which is DU.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:55.080,00:02:57.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is my DU.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:57.260,00:02:59.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let me compare these.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:59.620,00:03:05.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,So my final grid solution is very sharp, but only,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:05.480,00:03:08.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's bigger, but only contains the very sharp features,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:08.620,00:03:10.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,the high frequency contents.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:10.180,00:03:13.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,My cost grid solution is actually a lot better,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:13.720,00:03:15.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,but it's smaller.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:15.820,00:03:21.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Therefore, what I do is I perform this interpolation.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:21.120,00:03:24.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's go here, and we have the DUF.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:24.220,00:03:30.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now let's look at, I am sure, of what is DUF.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:30.260,00:03:32.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is DUF.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:32.960,00:03:39.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you compare this, this is my original U0.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:39.700,00:03:43.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is my DUF.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:43.060,00:03:44.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,So U0, DUF.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:44.500,00:03:45.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,You can see that.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:45.660,00:03:49.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,DUF is blurred, right, because it's interpolated
Dialogue: 0,00:03:49.260,00:03:51.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,from the cost grid.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:51.280,00:03:55.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well, if you add this up to DU, let's do that.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:55.960,00:03:59.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's step so that we have U1.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:59.580,00:04:05.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,We figure, I am sure, of U1, which is the summation of U0
Dialogue: 0,00:04:05.940,00:04:06.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,and DUF.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:09.820,00:04:15.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Get a solution that is, of course, much better than U0.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:15.660,00:04:21.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,But it's also better than the interpolated cost grid solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:21.040,00:04:26.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is interpolated cost grid solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:26.820,00:04:28.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is the summation of these two.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:28.840,00:04:30.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,Cost solution, summation, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:30.420,00:04:32.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,You can see the solution has improved.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:32.460,00:04:37.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,It has the sharp features on top of it.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:37.220,00:04:40.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,OK, let's keep going through the code.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:40.460,00:04:44.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,And now we are at an even final grid.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:44.860,00:04:45.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,OK.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:45.660,00:04:52.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,So 1024, so that's at our finest grid, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:52.480,00:04:55.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we can see the same thing here.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:55.900,00:04:59.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm going to close it.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:59.780,00:05:02.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm going to show the U0.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:02.640,00:05:08.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,The U0 has the very sharp contents of this airplane.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:08.960,00:05:15.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,And DUF has almost the entire solution, but it's probably
Dialogue: 0,00:05:15.060,00:05:18.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,missing the most high frequency contents.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:18.960,00:05:24.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,And now if I step over, I have U1.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:28.120,00:05:30.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's our funnel.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:30.040,00:05:33.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's our summation of the cost grid solution
Dialogue: 0,00:05:33.760,00:05:38.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the smoothing I have performed in my finest grid.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:38.800,00:05:39.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,OK.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:39.900,00:05:41.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,And continue.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:41.380,00:05:44.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm done with one multi-grid cycle, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:44.480,00:05:53.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I have stepped going down from the finest grid
Dialogue: 0,00:05:53.760,00:05:57.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,to the closest grid and then back to the finest grid.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:57.840,00:06:02.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,So one iteration, I have solutions of all frequency
Dialogue: 0,00:06:02.600,00:06:03.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,added together.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:03.800,00:06:07.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that's still not fully converged,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:07.480,00:06:10.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,because I have performed only one cycle.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:10.540,00:06:13.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if you keep performing these multi-grid cycles, you're going to converge.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:13.520,00:06:14.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,OK.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:14.020,00:06:14.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,OK.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:14.480,00:06:16.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to go back to the solution.
