Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:05.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And as we know, nobody can integrate time exactly.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:05.000,00:00:15.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So from your project, if you use OD45, I know some people see weird oscillations that can be reduced if you set the tolerance of OD45 to smaller.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:15.000,00:00:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right? So that's because OD45 also don't know how to integrate things exactly.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:24.000,00:00:33.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,But if now we don't know how to integrate things exactly, we may not have a stable solution, even with that good numerical scheme.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:33.000,00:00:35.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes, question?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:37.000,00:00:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,To take a Fourier transform, does the system have to be stable in the first place?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:42.000,00:00:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The answer is no.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:44.000,00:00:51.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because we are only taking Fourier transform to the function, to the solution at a particular time.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:51.000,00:00:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you draw y-axis as time, x-axis as time.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:54.000,00:00:55.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And y-axis as space.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:55.000,00:01:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,We are only doing Fourier series to every horizontal slice of the solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:02.000,00:01:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And stability means as you go up in the time domain, does things blow up or does things not blow up?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:10.000,00:01:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the Fourier series and the stability is analyzed on two different axes.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:16.000,00:01:21.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,They commute. They don't interfere with each other.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:21.000,00:01:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:22.000,00:01:23.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So yes, if I'm taking Fourier series on the x-axis, I can't do anything.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:23.000,00:01:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:24.000,00:01:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,But if I'm taking Fourier series on t, then I do have to make sure it is stable.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:28.000,00:01:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's a good question.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:30.000,00:01:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any other questions?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:32.000,00:01:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:36.000,00:01:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Space-time discretization.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:40.000,00:01:43.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's what we said.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:43.000,00:01:53.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now if we further discretize the differential equation in time, then what we have is the system is no longer stable.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:53.000,00:01:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Always.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:54.000,00:01:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Always.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:56.000,00:01:57.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Always.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:57.000,00:02:03.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So how many people knows stability analysis of ODE solvers?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:03.000,00:02:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Like, forward Euler is stable if, anybody can answer the question?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:16.000,00:02:19.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Forward Euler is basically solving a differential equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:19.000,00:02:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's say x at k plus one over t.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:22.000,00:02:23.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:23.000,00:02:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So k plus one minus x k divided by delta t.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:28.000,00:02:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,No delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:30.000,00:02:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's say equal to lambda x k.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:32.000,00:02:33.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:33.000,00:02:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's for solving a scalar ODE.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:36.000,00:02:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It is stable if what?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:40.000,00:02:43.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Delta t is less than something.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:43.000,00:02:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:46.000,00:02:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's look at this equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:48.000,00:02:49.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:49.000,00:02:51.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the way to analyze stability of ODE solvers is to look at the following.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:51.000,00:02:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's say here of ODE solver, explicit ODE solvers doing this.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:56.000,00:02:59.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's moving all the known.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:59.000,00:03:03.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's imagine we are solving this at time step k.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:03.000,00:03:05.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,What are the known numbers?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:05.000,00:03:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,What are the unknown numbers?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:10.000,00:03:11.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,x k is known.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:11.000,00:03:13.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,x at k plus one is unknown.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:13.000,00:03:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:14.000,00:03:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,We solve for x k plus one.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:16.000,00:03:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then k plus one becomes my k.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:18.000,00:03:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we go forward to solve for k plus two.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:20.000,00:03:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to use red to specify the unknown and blue to specify the known.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:32.000,00:03:39.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the way to analyze the stability is move all the unknowns to the left-hand side.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:39.000,00:03:43.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And move all the known to the right-hand side.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:43.000,00:03:47.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So x k over delta t is moved to here.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:47.000,00:03:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Bless you.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:48.000,00:03:49.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:49.000,00:03:53.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And lambda x k is over here.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:53.000,00:03:58.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Which is combined into one over delta t plus lambda times x k.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:58.000,00:04:01.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And imagine.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:01.000,00:04:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And also multiply the delta t on both sides.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:04.000,00:04:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we get x k plus one is equal to one plus delta t lambda times x k.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:10.000,00:04:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And you can do this exercise for all kinds of ODE solvers.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:16.000,00:04:19.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Including the schemes used in ODE 45.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:19.000,00:04:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean ODE 45 uses two schemes.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:20.000,00:04:23.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,A fourth order scheme and a fifth order scheme.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:23.000,00:04:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's why it is called 4-5.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:25.000,00:04:31.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And it adapts its time step by comparing the error, the difference between the fourth order
Dialogue: 0,00:04:31.000,00:04:33.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,scheme and the fifth order scheme.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:33.000,00:04:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,If they agree pretty well, it thinks the solution is accurate enough and keeps going.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:38.000,00:04:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Otherwise it tries to reduce delta t to make it better.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:42.000,00:04:43.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:43.000,00:04:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you can do the same thing for there.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:44.000,00:04:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Just to move all the unknowns to the left-hand side.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:46.000,00:04:47.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Move all the knowns to the right-hand side.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:47.000,00:04:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:48.000,00:04:49.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you can do the same thing for there.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:49.000,00:04:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Just to move all the unknowns to the left-hand side.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:50.000,00:04:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And remember here lambda can be complex.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:52.000,00:05:01.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for what values of lambda delta t would this equation be stable?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:01.000,00:05:07.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,If I draw a complex plan for delta t lambda.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:07.000,00:05:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the real part.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:08.000,00:05:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is imaginary part.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:10.000,00:05:13.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Delta t lambda.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:13.000,00:05:17.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Which part of the complex domain is this iteration.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:17.000,00:05:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Stable.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:18.000,00:05:19.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Meaning not going to infinity.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:19.000,00:05:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right part.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:20.000,00:05:21.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Huh?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:21.000,00:05:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right part of the domain.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:22.000,00:05:23.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right part of the domain.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:23.000,00:05:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if my lambda delta t is for example 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:24.000,00:05:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is the iteration going to be stable?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:25.000,00:05:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,If lambda delta t is equal to 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:26.000,00:05:27.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,1 plus 1 is going to be 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:27.000,00:05:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,That means xk plus 1 is equal to 2.

Dialogue: 0,00:06:57.100,00:07:02.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,then 1 plus delta t lambda is going to be in this dashed circle.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:03.100,00:07:03.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:04.260,00:07:10.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the dashed circle has a modulus less than 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:11.040,00:07:13.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the modulus less than 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:13.560,00:07:16.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,is what we need for this iteration to be stable.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:17.260,00:07:17.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,To not grow.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:19.220,00:07:24.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,The magnitude of xk plus 1 is equal to the modulus of this complex number
Dialogue: 0,00:07:24.820,00:07:26.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,times the magnitude of xk.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:27.000,00:07:29.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you need something that is less than unity
Dialogue: 0,00:07:29.600,00:07:32.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,for the iteration to be stable.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:32.680,00:07:34.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:34.220,00:07:36.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's for this scalar equation.
