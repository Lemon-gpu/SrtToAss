Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:13.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have integration from a to b phi j times f minus summation of i goes from 1 to n, a i phi i dx equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:13.320,00:00:15.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's pull these things out.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:16.220,00:00:19.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the first term is phi j f times dx.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:20.060,00:00:24.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then the summation can be pulled out of the integral.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:24.640,00:00:28.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,a i's are not a function of x, so it can be pulled out of the integral.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:28.640,00:00:35.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the integral becomes integration from a to b phi j phi i dx is equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:37.560,00:00:38.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:39.980,00:00:41.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,f is a known function.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:43.560,00:00:55.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,If we can construct an explicit set of faces, phi 1, phi 2, etc.,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:55.640,00:00:58.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,then we can compute this integration.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:58.640,00:01:00.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we can write the integral for any f.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:02.480,00:01:14.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right, so let's define a vector b that is equal to integration of a to b phi 1 f dx,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:14.480,00:01:22.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,integration a to b phi 2 f dx, all the way to integration of phi n f dx.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:23.480,00:01:24.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:25.480,00:01:27.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,Also, if we can construct an explicit form of phi,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:27.480,00:01:28.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,we can write the integral for any f.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:28.640,00:01:30.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,So integration of phi 1, phi 2, etc.,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:30.480,00:01:32.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,we can also define a matrix A.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:32.640,00:01:43.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,That is the integral of pairwise products of these basis functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:43.520,00:01:50.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Integration of phi 1, phi 1 dx, integration of phi 1, phi 2 dx,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:50.080,00:01:53.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,integration of phi 1, phi n dx.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:53.200,00:01:54.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Da da da.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:54.680,00:01:57.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is integration of phi n, phi 1 dx, etc.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:57.480,00:02:00.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's actually integration of phi n, phi n, dx.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:01.020,00:02:01.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:01.340,00:02:02.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we can get this matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:04.720,00:02:06.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, this is a matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:06.780,00:02:07.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is a vector.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:07.440,00:02:15.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,This equality becomes a times a equal to b.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:18.960,00:02:19.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:19.160,00:02:19.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:23.560,00:02:32.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the function approximation within a linear space becomes ax equal to b, which we know how to solve.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:33.840,00:02:38.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,The process of finite element actually in general is like that.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:38.800,00:02:49.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,It is to construct the right-hand side and the matrix by performing integrals of basis functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:49.160,00:02:51.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,And known functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:51.540,00:02:51.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:51.700,00:02:58.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,So basically, you do integrals either numerically using quadrature or analytically if the function is simply enough.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:59.180,00:03:01.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,To construct a matrix and the right-hand side.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:02.480,00:03:05.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,We solve the matrix to get linear combination of the basis functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:05.940,00:03:14.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the linear combination of the basis functions is going to give us g star that we know is the optimal.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:15.060,00:03:18.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,That satisfies all the...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:18.040,00:03:19.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,That satisfies this.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:19.160,00:03:21.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Linear equations for any g prime.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:21.280,00:03:24.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,G prime we call test function within the linear space.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:25.400,00:03:30.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,And because of these linear equations comes out of a projection.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:31.100,00:03:41.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,We know that the g prime we get actually minimizes the distance between g in the space and the particular function f.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:43.080,00:03:49.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in solving differential equations, we are not approximating a particular function.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:49.140,00:03:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,But we still will be able to use the concept of projection to minimize something.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:56.740,00:03:56.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:57.760,00:04:02.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Usually the residual of a differential equation or some other quantities.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:03.100,00:04:07.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,We minimize a certain quantity that we derive from the differential equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:07.840,00:04:10.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the minimization turns out to be a projection.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:11.120,00:04:13.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Projection turns out to be a system of differential equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:14.360,00:04:19.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Using a basis, the system of differential equations turns into a matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:19.140,00:04:21.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,We solve the matrix equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:21.080,00:04:23.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,We get the linear combination coefficients.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:24.540,00:04:29.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,And by recombining the basis functions, we get to the solution to the differential equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:30.580,00:04:33.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's generally how finite elements work.
