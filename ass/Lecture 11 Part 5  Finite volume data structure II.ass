Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:04.000,00:00:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,What is the structure of the grid going to be?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:08.000,00:00:12.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Like the actual...
Dialogue: 0,00:00:12.000,00:00:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,How do you get the normal
Dialogue: 0,00:00:16.000,00:00:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the SIG from
Dialogue: 0,00:00:20.000,00:00:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,your grid information? How do I get that from the grid information?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:24.000,00:00:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:28.000,00:00:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's a very good question. So let me
Dialogue: 0,00:00:32.000,00:00:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,actually demonstrate using
Dialogue: 0,00:00:36.000,00:00:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,one thing. How do I do that?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:40.000,00:00:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for example, in MATLAB there is a good PD toolbox.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:44.000,00:00:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay. So the
Dialogue: 0,00:00:48.000,00:00:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,PD toolbox is useful for generating a mesh. For example,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:52.000,00:00:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,if I just draw a circle over here and
Dialogue: 0,00:00:56.000,00:01:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I click mesh, I get a mesh.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:00.000,00:01:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,MATLAB PD toolbox supports the kind of unstructured
Dialogue: 0,00:01:04.000,00:01:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,triangular mesh.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:08.000,00:01:12.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then after you generate a mesh, you can export the mesh
Dialogue: 0,00:01:12.000,00:01:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,into this environment.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:16.000,00:01:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we can see we have E
Dialogue: 0,00:01:20.000,00:01:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and P and T. So P is
Dialogue: 0,00:01:24.000,00:01:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,going to be all the grid points. So for example,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:28.000,00:01:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,if you plot P1 and P2
Dialogue: 0,00:01:36.000,00:01:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,you get all
Dialogue: 0,00:01:40.000,00:01:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the points where we generated.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:44.000,00:01:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The T, the triangle, the T's
Dialogue: 0,00:01:48.000,00:01:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,are a 4 by the number of triangles.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:52.000,00:01:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have 992 triangles. The fourth
Dialogue: 0,00:01:56.000,00:02:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,column is R1. It's the number of, it's the domain
Dialogue: 0,00:02:00.000,00:02:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,index. So in this case we only have one domain, so it's R1. We don't
Dialogue: 0,00:02:04.000,00:02:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,need to care about that. And the other three rows, 1, 2, 3
Dialogue: 0,00:02:08.000,00:02:12.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,are integers corresponding to the index
Dialogue: 0,00:02:12.000,00:02:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,in the P array. Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:16.000,00:02:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So these, for example, gives you
Dialogue: 0,00:02:20.000,00:02:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,gives you
Dialogue: 0,00:02:22.000,00:02:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the length, so the length of the
Dialogue: 0,00:02:26.000,00:02:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,triangle size and the direction of the triangle size
Dialogue: 0,00:02:30.000,00:02:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,are going to give you the surface normals.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:34.000,00:02:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right. So for example,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:38.000,00:02:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so let me
Dialogue: 0,00:02:42.000,00:02:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,let me just walk you through this one. So for example, I
Dialogue: 0,00:02:46.000,00:02:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,coded up a function, it's a pretty short function that extracts
Dialogue: 0,00:02:50.000,00:02:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the edges from the P's and T's. So from the points and triangles.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:54.000,00:02:58.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you run it, for example,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:58.000,00:03:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,extract edges, P and T, what I
Dialogue: 0,00:03:02.000,00:03:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,returned you is an array
Dialogue: 0,00:03:06.000,00:03:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,of 4 by
Dialogue: 0,00:03:10.000,00:03:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,1520. And 1520 turns out to be the
Dialogue: 0,00:03:14.000,00:03:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,number of edges in the whole mesh.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:18.000,00:03:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And
Dialogue: 0,00:03:20.000,00:03:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the four rows are
Dialogue: 0,00:03:24.000,00:03:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the first two rows
Dialogue: 0,00:03:28.000,00:03:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,are indices corresponding
Dialogue: 0,00:03:30.000,00:03:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,to the array P.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:32.000,00:03:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,That means which two
Dialogue: 0,00:03:34.000,00:03:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,points are these edges
Dialogue: 0,00:03:36.000,00:03:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,connected.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:38.000,00:03:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The three and
Dialogue: 0,00:03:40.000,00:03:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,fourth row are
Dialogue: 0,00:03:42.000,00:03:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,indices in the
Dialogue: 0,00:03:44.000,00:03:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,array T. That means
Dialogue: 0,00:03:46.000,00:03:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,which two triangles
Dialogue: 0,00:03:48.000,00:03:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,are these edges
Dialogue: 0,00:03:50.000,00:03:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,separated.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:52.000,00:03:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay. So if you
Dialogue: 0,00:03:54.000,00:03:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,if you use, if you follow
Dialogue: 0,00:03:56.000,00:03:58.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the unstructured
Dialogue: 0,00:03:58.000,00:04:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,mesh finite volume, then
Dialogue: 0,00:04:00.000,00:04:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's the third and fourth
Dialogue: 0,00:04:02.000,00:04:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,row that
Dialogue: 0,00:04:04.000,00:04:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,identifies which control,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:06.000,00:04:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,that identifies the corresponding
Dialogue: 0,00:04:08.000,00:04:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,i and j of that interface.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:10.000,00:04:12.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,But you can use
Dialogue: 0,00:04:12.000,00:04:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the row one and row two to calculate
Dialogue: 0,00:04:14.000,00:04:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,what is the normal
Dialogue: 0,00:04:16.000,00:04:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the s i j.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:18.000,00:04:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for example,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:20.000,00:04:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,for example, if you
Dialogue: 0,00:04:22.000,00:04:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,compute the distance,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:24.000,00:04:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so let's say d s,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:26.000,00:04:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the distance between these two
Dialogue: 0,00:04:28.000,00:04:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,points would be equal to
Dialogue: 0,00:04:30.000,00:04:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,P of
Dialogue: 0,00:04:32.000,00:04:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,P of
Dialogue: 0,00:04:34.000,00:04:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,column, which includes
Dialogue: 0,00:04:36.000,00:04:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,both x and y.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:38.000,00:04:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the first dimension is x and y.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:40.000,00:04:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Of e1
Dialogue: 0,00:04:42.000,00:04:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,column minus
Dialogue: 0,00:04:44.000,00:04:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,p e2
Dialogue: 0,00:04:46.000,00:04:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,column. That'll give
Dialogue: 0,00:04:48.000,00:04:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,us the, the
Dialogue: 0,00:04:50.000,00:04:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the distance,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:52.000,00:04:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the vector that points from
Dialogue: 0,00:04:54.000,00:04:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,one point to the other point
Dialogue: 0,00:04:56.000,00:04:58.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,along the edge.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:58.000,00:05:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the length would be just
Dialogue: 0,00:05:00.000,00:05:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,equal to
Dialogue: 0,00:05:02.000,00:05:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the square root of d s

Dialogue: 0,00:05:14.000,00:05:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that'll give me
Dialogue: 0,00:05:16.000,00:05:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,that'll give me the
Dialogue: 0,00:05:18.000,00:05:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,length

Dialogue: 0,00:05:22.000,00:05:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,These numbers are similar.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:24.000,00:05:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so the surface normals
Dialogue: 0,00:05:26.000,00:05:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,would be equal
Dialogue: 0,00:05:28.000,00:05:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,to d s

Dialogue: 0,00:05:42.000,00:05:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,uh, divided by
Dialogue: 0,00:05:44.000,00:05:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,s. I don't know if the division works.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:48.000,00:05:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so I have to wrap

Dialogue: 0,00:05:52.000,00:05:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,over two and one. So that's
Dialogue: 0,00:05:54.000,00:05:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,right, so that'll
Dialogue: 0,00:05:56.000,00:05:58.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,that'll give me
Dialogue: 0,00:06:02.000,00:06:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the matrix dimension must

Dialogue: 0,00:06:06.000,00:06:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,s is this by this.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:08.000,00:06:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,If I replicate it,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:14.000,00:06:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,is it wrapped like that?

Dialogue: 0,00:06:22.000,00:06:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It should be a semicolon, yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:24.000,00:06:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that'll give me
Dialogue: 0,00:06:26.000,00:06:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the normals of all the interfaces.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:28.000,00:06:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:30.000,00:06:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Does that make sense?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:32.000,00:06:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's all from
Dialogue: 0,00:06:34.000,00:06:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's all from like a

Dialogue: 0,00:06:46.000,00:06:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the number of points

Dialogue: 0,00:06:50.000,00:06:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the number of edges should be

Dialogue: 0,00:07:00.000,00:07:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,because

Dialogue: 0,00:07:06.000,00:07:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right, so
Dialogue: 0,00:07:08.000,00:07:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so if you look at

Dialogue: 0,00:07:22.000,00:07:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean, every point can have many edges
Dialogue: 0,00:07:24.000,00:07:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and every edge only have 2 points.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:26.000,00:07:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the number of
Dialogue: 0,00:07:28.000,00:07:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,edges is equal to the number of points
Dialogue: 0,00:07:32.000,00:07:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,times the average number of edges
Dialogue: 0,00:07:34.000,00:07:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,shared by a point
Dialogue: 0,00:07:36.000,00:07:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,divided by 2, which is the number of
Dialogue: 0,00:07:38.000,00:07:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,points shared by an edge.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:40.000,00:07:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if the number of
Dialogue: 0,00:07:44.000,00:07:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,if the number of edges
Dialogue: 0,00:07:46.000,00:07:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,shared by a point is greater than
Dialogue: 0,00:07:48.000,00:07:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,4 on average, then the number
Dialogue: 0,00:07:50.000,00:07:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,of edges is going to be more than
Dialogue: 0,00:07:52.000,00:07:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,twice the number of points.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:58.000,00:08:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well, there is
Dialogue: 0,00:08:00.000,00:08:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,a relationship between the number of edges
Dialogue: 0,00:08:02.000,00:08:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the number of triangles.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:04.000,00:08:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you look at T,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:06.000,00:08:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we have this many triangles
Dialogue: 0,00:08:08.000,00:08:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we have this many edges. Every triangle
Dialogue: 0,00:08:10.000,00:08:12.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,is shared by
Dialogue: 0,00:08:14.000,00:08:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,3, uh, every triangle
Dialogue: 0,00:08:16.000,00:08:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,is shared by 3 edges.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:18.000,00:08:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right, and
Dialogue: 0,00:08:20.000,00:08:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,every edge is shared
Dialogue: 0,00:08:22.000,00:08:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,by either 1 or 2 triangles
Dialogue: 0,00:08:24.000,00:08:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,depending on if that edge lies on the boundary
Dialogue: 0,00:08:26.000,00:08:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,or in the interior.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:28.000,00:08:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So there is a
Dialogue: 0,00:08:30.000,00:08:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,inequality
Dialogue: 0,00:08:32.000,00:08:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,constraining the number of edges
Dialogue: 0,00:08:34.000,00:08:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the number of triangles you can
Dialogue: 0,00:08:36.000,00:08:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,apply here. But I don't
Dialogue: 0,00:08:38.000,00:08:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,see any constraints in the

Dialogue: 0,00:09:10.000,00:09:12.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:12.000,00:09:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's, uh,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:14.000,00:09:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,now
Dialogue: 0,00:09:16.000,00:09:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we are basically talking
Dialogue: 0,00:09:18.000,00:09:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,about how to apply
Dialogue: 0,00:09:20.000,00:09:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,finite volume, uh, on, uh,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:22.000,00:09:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,on, uh,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:24.000,00:09:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,on multiple

Dialogue: 0,00:09:28.000,00:09:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,complex geometry. Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:30.000,00:09:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you need to generate a mesh and
Dialogue: 0,00:09:32.000,00:09:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,there are plenty of mesh
Dialogue: 0,00:09:34.000,00:09:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,generators out there.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:36.000,00:09:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,You can use, if you just want to

Dialogue: 0,00:09:48.000,00:09:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,for you. And, uh,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:50.000,00:09:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we have, uh, open source mesh generators
Dialogue: 0,00:09:52.000,00:09:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,like Gmesh and commercial
Dialogue: 0,00:09:54.000,00:09:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,mesh generators, uh, like Pointwise

Dialogue: 0,00:10:00.000,00:10:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay. Um, so
Dialogue: 0,00:10:02.000,00:10:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,once we generate a mesh, we can compute
Dialogue: 0,00:10:04.000,00:10:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,these surface normals
Dialogue: 0,00:10:06.000,00:10:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and surface sizes, and we
Dialogue: 0,00:10:08.000,00:10:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,use the same type of
Dialogue: 0,00:10:10.000,00:10:12.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,reconstruction schemes. We use
Dialogue: 0,00:10:12.000,00:10:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the same type of finite volume schemes
Dialogue: 0,00:10:14.000,00:10:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,to compute a flux

Dialogue: 0,00:10:28.000,00:10:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we compute the time derivative,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:30.000,00:10:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,which we can apply to an
