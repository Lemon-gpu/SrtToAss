Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So there are three elements in here, three things we need to calculate. One is the area of each triangle.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:08.000,00:00:15.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And what is the gradient of each of these basis functions on the triangle.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:15.000,00:00:19.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so let's figure out how to calculate the area first.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:19.000,00:00:23.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So to make it easier, let's make a script.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:23.000,00:00:29.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Go to script, find element 2D.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:29.000,00:00:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, I'm going to assume I already have the P, T, and IB calculated.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:40.000,00:00:45.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what I'm going to do is I'm going to first try to calculate the area.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:45.000,00:00:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Area is going to be zeros, the number of elements.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:52.000,00:00:53.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let me first...
Dialogue: 0,00:00:53.000,00:00:59.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so number of elements is equal to the length of the triangles.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:59.000,00:01:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's triangles, the second dimension.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:02.000,00:01:05.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So any is the number of triangles.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:05.000,00:01:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So A...
Dialogue: 0,00:01:06.000,00:01:09.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let me reserve the big A for the matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:09.000,00:01:11.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let me call it small a to be the area.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:11.000,00:01:12.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let me see.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:12.000,00:01:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the area, small a.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:16.000,00:01:17.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:20.000,00:01:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So small a is equal to any at 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:23.000,00:01:29.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I'm going to go over all the triangles.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:29.000,00:01:31.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:31.000,00:01:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The area is going to be equal to...
Dialogue: 0,00:01:36.000,00:01:39.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's really...
Dialogue: 0,00:01:39.000,00:01:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I need to figure out two of the edges and do a cross product between the two edges.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:46.000,00:01:49.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,That divided by 2 is going to be the area.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:49.000,00:01:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:50.000,00:01:53.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let me first compute the vertices.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:53.000,00:01:55.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So v1...
Dialogue: 0,00:01:55.000,00:02:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so let me say v is equal to zeros, 2, 3.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:02.000,00:02:05.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I have a vertex array.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:05.000,00:02:07.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The first dimension is x and y.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:07.000,00:02:13.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The second dimension is the three vertices of the triangle.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:13.000,00:02:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So v1 is equal to my p of...
Dialogue: 0,00:02:18.000,00:02:19.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:19.000,00:02:27.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,My p of column and my t of 1 and i.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:27.000,00:02:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:28.000,00:02:33.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the location of the first vertex.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:33.000,00:02:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So my second vertex...
Dialogue: 0,00:02:38.000,00:02:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,To make it a little bit clearer, let me just call it v1.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:42.000,00:02:45.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let me just call it v2.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:45.000,00:02:47.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let me just call it v3.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:47.000,00:02:49.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So 2 and 3.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:49.000,00:02:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:50.000,00:02:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So these are the three vertices.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:52.000,00:02:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Each one is just two numbers, x and y.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:56.000,00:03:05.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So ai is the cross product, which is really the dot product of v1 minus v2.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:05.000,00:03:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And basically the rotated vector of v1 minus v3.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:16.000,00:03:17.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:17.000,00:03:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let me here...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:18.000,00:03:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm just going to make it a matrix times...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:24.000,00:03:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The rotated vector is 0, 1 minus 1, 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:28.000,00:03:29.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:29.000,00:03:31.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's this...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:31.000,00:03:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,You basically take one of the edges, you rotate it by 90 degrees, and you dot product with the other edge.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:38.000,00:03:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's the cross product.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:40.000,00:03:41.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:41.000,00:03:45.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that divided by 2 is going to be the area.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:47.000,00:03:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you want it to be 3.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:50.000,00:03:51.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, yes.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:51.000,00:03:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,One of them should be 3.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:52.000,00:03:53.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Thank you.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:53.000,00:03:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's run it to see what I get.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:56.000,00:04:01.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I get an a that is equal to a bunch of things.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:01.000,00:04:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the magnitude seems to match the size of the areas.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:08.000,00:04:11.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:11.000,00:04:12.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:12.000,00:04:15.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any questions on this?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:15.000,00:04:17.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,No?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:17.000,00:04:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:18.000,00:04:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So next we have the area.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:20.000,00:04:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Next is to compute the gradients of the basis functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:25.000,00:04:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:26.000,00:04:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,In order to compute the gradient, let's use the fact that if I have the gradient of phi i,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:36.000,00:04:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the gradient of phi i dot with any vector, let's say the vector of v...
Dialogue: 0,00:04:44.000,00:04:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The location of the vertex i minus the location of the vertex j, for example.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:52.000,00:04:55.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,This should be equal to what?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:55.000,00:05:01.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The gradient of that particular basis function that is equal to 1 at v i and 0 at v j.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:01.000,00:05:05.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,What should it be?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:05.000,00:05:09.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The gradient of a linear function dot with a vector should be what?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:09.000,00:05:12.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,This should be the value of that phi i at v i minus the location of the vertex j.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:12.000,00:05:15.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this should be the gradient of phi i at v i minus the value...
Dialogue: 0,00:05:15.000,00:05:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let me say it's x i and x j.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:18.000,00:05:19.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Sorry.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:19.000,00:05:23.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So x is the location of the vertices.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:23.000,00:05:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:24.000,00:05:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if I have a gradient of phi i dot with the difference between the two locations,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:30.000,00:05:35.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,this should be phi i at x i minus phi i at x j.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:35.000,00:05:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:36.000,00:05:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,This should be what?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:40.000,00:05:41.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Should be 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:41.000,00:05:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:42.000,00:05:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because unless i is equal to j.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:48.000,00:05:55.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for any x j that is in the triangle but different from i,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:55.000,00:05:59.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the gradient dot this should be equal to 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:59.000,00:06:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:00.000,00:06:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let me...
Dialogue: 0,00:06:02.000,00:06:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now we have the three x's in the triangle.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:06.000,00:06:09.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,There are two independent j's I can use.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:11.000,00:06:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that allows me to form two linear equations whose right hand side are just 1 and 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:16.000,00:06:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The left hand side is...
Dialogue: 0,00:06:18.000,00:06:27.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The left hand side is a matrix that is formed by...
Dialogue: 0,00:06:27.000,00:06:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let me see.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:30.000,00:06:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So x...
Dialogue: 0,00:06:32.000,00:06:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,x1 minus x2.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:36.000,00:06:39.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's call it y1 minus y2.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:39.000,00:06:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,x1 minus x3.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:40.000,00:06:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,y1 minus y3.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:42.000,00:06:45.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So these are x and y coordinates.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:45.000,00:06:53.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Dot with the x-directional gradient of the first basis and y gradient of the first basis.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:53.000,00:06:55.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,That should be equal to 1 and 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:55.000,00:06:59.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:59.000,00:07:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this gives us linear equations to solve for the gradient as a vector.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:08.000,00:07:09.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's form the matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:09.000,00:07:11.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And compute it.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:11.000,00:07:17.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So to form the matrix we just need v1 minus v2.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:17.000,00:07:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that is our first row.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:20.000,00:07:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we need to transpose it to get a row vector.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:24.000,00:07:31.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And v1 minus v3 transpose to get a row vector.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:31.000,00:07:37.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this inverse times the right hand side, 1, 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:37.000,00:07:43.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is going to be the gradient of the first basis.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:43.000,00:07:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:44.000,00:07:51.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I can do these three times to get the gradients of the three basis functions associated with that triangle.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:51.000,00:07:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So g2 should be 2, 3.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:56.000,00:07:59.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,This should be 3, 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:59.000,00:08:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,This should be 2, 3.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:02.000,00:08:05.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,This should be 1 and 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:05.000,00:08:15.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So each of the matrix is formed by the difference between one vector and the other two vectors on the triangle.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:15.000,00:08:21.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so now we get the three gradients.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:21.000,00:08:31.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now we have all the formula we need to compute the value of the matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:31.000,00:08:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:32.000,00:08:33.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,But the matrix is a summation over all the values.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:33.000,00:08:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:34.000,00:08:37.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have the summation over all the elements.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:37.000,00:08:49.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now instead of going through all the pairs of i and j and figure out all the elements that are shared by the basis function i and the basis function j.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:49.000,00:08:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,We loop over the elements and accumulate these values of a and j.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:54.000,00:09:01.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we loop over all the k's and look for whichever pairs of i and j this k contributes to.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:01.000,00:09:03.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,We just add it on top of it.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:04.000,00:09:09.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what I'm going to do is I'm going to make a matrix a is equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:09.000,00:09:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,What's the size of this matrix?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:16.000,00:09:17.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Should be the number of points.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:17.000,00:09:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:18.000,00:09:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's also make it mp is equal to size of p and 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:25.000,00:09:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's the size of the matrix mp by mp.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:32.000,00:09:41.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this element has three basis functions that it can contribute to.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:41.000,00:09:53.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what I have to have is let me call it i1, i2, and i3.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:53.000,00:10:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And these are just the i1.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:00.000,00:10:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's simplify it.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:02.000,00:10:05.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,i2 and i3.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:05.000,00:10:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:06.000,00:10:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So these are computing the three vertex points.
