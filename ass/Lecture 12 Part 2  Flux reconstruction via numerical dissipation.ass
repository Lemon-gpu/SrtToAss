Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:22.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,If we do flux reconstruction by numerical dissipation, that is, if we have a finite volume scheme, we have multiple u's or a single u's. It's going to be equivalent. We have i minus 1, i and i plus 1 as cell averages.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:22.600,00:00:45.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we want to compute the flux at i plus half. The flux at i plus half can simply be the average of the flux applied on u i plus the flux applied on u i plus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:45.700,00:00:52.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,We know if we just do that, we tried that, the central flux scheme, it gives us parable results.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:52.600,00:00:57.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,Once we create a shockwave, it basically blows up.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:58.400,00:01:11.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we did a stability analysis to show that this scheme conserves the third power of the solution u, and therefore it never allows the shockwave to dissipate the solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:13.420,00:01:21.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,But if we add something on top of it, if we add something on top of it, that is,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:22.600,00:01:35.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,proportional to delta x, first of all, and that is, and multiplied by the characteristics, which is df du.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:36.720,00:01:47.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,And here we should be using a sufficient dissipation that is as big as the maximum absolute value of df du within the range u i and u i plus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:48.000,00:01:52.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let me just say a max of df du times a flux.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:52.600,00:01:59.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,First of all, the derivative of u, which is u i plus 1 minus u i divided by delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:01.780,00:02:04.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,So why am I taking the first order derivative here?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:06.640,00:02:18.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because when you plug in this term in a finite volume discretization, remember a finite volume discretization, we have du i dt.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:18.880,00:02:31.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we can say that the derivative of u i plus 1 minus u i minus 1 is equal to f of i minus 1 minus f i minus half minus f i plus half divided by delta t.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:32.080,00:02:41.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that is going to give us, first of all, a term corresponding to a central difference in the flux.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:42.460,00:02:47.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,So u of i plus 1 minus f of u i minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:47.680,00:02:48.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the first term.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:48.880,00:02:56.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the second term is going to give us plus delta x here cancels with delta x here.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:56.380,00:02:57.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And there is one more delta x here.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:58.380,00:03:04.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what we get is a term that is proportional to u i plus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:05.060,00:03:08.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the i plus half part minus u i.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:08.560,00:03:16.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,But there is another contribution of u i from the i minus half part plus u i minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:17.960,00:03:18.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Times...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:18.040,00:03:23.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,Times the df du.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:23.020,00:03:23.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:28.280,00:03:42.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So by adding a flux that is proportional to the first order derivative of u, we are essentially adding a second order derivative in the right-hand side of this equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:42.780,00:03:47.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,So here, another way to think about this is...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:47.020,00:03:48.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,If...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:48.040,00:03:53.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,We want to use finite volume scheme to discretize a second order spatial derivative,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:54.660,00:03:59.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,we should be adding a first order derivative in the flux function.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:00.380,00:04:06.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,And in this case, we want to, in order to achieve the same upwinding effect,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:07.900,00:04:13.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,here is that, without knowing which side the characteristics comes from,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:14.720,00:04:17.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,we want to add a numerical dissipation.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:18.040,00:04:22.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,That is proportional to delta x times the second order derivative of x.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:24.180,00:04:31.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Therefore, in the flux, we add a term that is proportional to the first order derivative of u to x times the grid size.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:32.740,00:04:33.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's a very good question.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:33.880,00:04:35.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,This term is supposed to be delta x squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:36.740,00:04:37.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes, if...
Dialogue: 0,00:04:37.800,00:04:42.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,If we want to discretize the second order derivative, it should be delta x squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:42.620,00:04:46.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,But in this case, we want to multiply another delta x here.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:46.640,00:04:47.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because...
Dialogue: 0,00:04:47.320,00:04:55.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you remember, the additional dissipation term is proportional to delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:56.120,00:05:00.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what we want to discretize is delta x times the second order derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:01.000,00:05:05.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Which means over here, it is okay to have divided by delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:05.600,00:05:05.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:06.860,00:05:07.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:07.180,00:05:12.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,Going back to the previous page where you were just showing why we use delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:14.520,00:05:16.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,The last green line.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:16.600,00:05:17.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,Where...
Dialogue: 0,00:05:17.180,00:05:19.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,Where did that arise?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:20.140,00:05:21.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,Where did that arise?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:21.420,00:05:25.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that arises in the Taylor series analysis of ui minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:26.380,00:05:28.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let me write it over here.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:28.760,00:05:46.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So ui minus 1 is equal to ui minus partial u partial x times delta x plus half of delta x squared partial squared u partial x squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:47.180,00:05:48.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:48.020,00:06:04.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if we do that and plug this ui minus 1 into this equation, because we're dividing by delta x, we get this term out.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:04.640,00:06:07.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this term is going to be here.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:08.600,00:06:13.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we also have this term, which we have delta x squared divided by delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:14.060,00:06:17.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have a term that is proportional to the second order derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:17.180,00:06:22.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,derivative. So I think I'm missing a half over here. So half is going to be added to
Dialogue: 0,00:06:22.420,00:06:31.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,delta x. And so if that's the case, I'm probably also missing a half over here. So the appropriate
Dialogue: 0,00:06:31.880,00:06:40.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,amount of numerical dissipation is half of delta x times the characteristic speed. So
Dialogue: 0,00:06:40.880,00:06:47.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,here I would also have half of that times the characteristic speed. So the question
Dialogue: 0,00:06:47.600,00:06:54.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,is why don't we apply upwinding to the linear combinations of variables that has just a
Dialogue: 0,00:06:54.040,00:07:01.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,single characteristic. The reason that is difficult is because this linear combination
Dialogue: 0,00:07:01.760,00:07:09.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,changes in time. So for example, if we have a shock wave, then at the next time step,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:09.140,00:07:10.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,even at the same grid point,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:10.600,00:07:10.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,the
Dialogue: 0,00:07:10.700,00:07:10.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,shock
Dialogue: 0,00:07:10.860,00:07:16.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,wave may have sweeped over the grid point. And therefore, before the time step and after
Dialogue: 0,00:07:16.900,00:07:21.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,the time step, the particular linear combination, which depends on the matrix, which depends
Dialogue: 0,00:07:21.640,00:07:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,on the solution, can change dramatically. So the particular linear combination you can
Dialogue: 0,00:07:28.000,00:07:35.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,compute before that time step may become no longer the appropriate linear combination
Dialogue: 0,00:07:35.480,00:07:40.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,to use for that characteristic after the time step.

Dialogue: 0,00:08:14.460,00:08:20.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is because, again, of the entropy condition.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:21.340,00:08:23.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So remember, the entropy condition says that
Dialogue: 0,00:08:23.320,00:08:28.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,no characteristics can emerge from a discontinuity, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:30.200,00:08:36.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,And in this case, because we had a count example
Dialogue: 0,00:08:36.740,00:08:41.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,that doesn't satisfy the entropy condition in the Berger's equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:41.740,00:08:49.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if we have an inverted shock wave where on the left u is equal to minus 1,

Dialogue: 0,00:08:53.220,00:09:01.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,What happens is that the flux on both left and right of the shock wave

Dialogue: 0,00:09:41.600,00:09:43.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right, so for example, the grid point here
