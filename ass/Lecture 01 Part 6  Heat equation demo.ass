Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:25.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's draw this case. Even if I draw a very jaggy case, the solution decays.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:25.740,00:00:28.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,And you can see different components decay at different rates.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:29.640,00:00:32.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,The very jaggy components decay very, very fast.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:33.020,00:00:36.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the relatively smooth components decay very slowly.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:37.460,00:00:43.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,And at this point, it looks almost like a constant plus a small amplitude sinusoidal wave.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:44.820,00:00:48.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,A sinusoidal wave is k equal to 1 and minus 1, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:50.620,00:00:53.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So at this point, and the k equal to 1 and minus 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:53.820,00:00:54.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,they decay this.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:54.600,00:00:59.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is among the slowest decaying components of the Fourier series.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:00.780,00:01:06.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,And even that slowly decays at the end, we're going to see it's going to be a constant in space.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:08.120,00:01:12.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that is the behavior of the heat equation in periodic domains.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:14.660,00:01:15.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:20.660,00:01:21.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any questions?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:24.600,00:01:26.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,Pardon?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:26.760,00:01:28.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,Can I have kappa to be positive?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:28.780,00:01:31.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,Can I have kappa to be, you mean negative?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:32.780,00:01:36.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So here, yeah, so here the kappa is positive.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:37.020,00:01:41.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you have kappa to be negative, what happens?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:43.040,00:01:49.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,Instead of exponential decay, you have exponential growth, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:50.660,00:01:54.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,That means if you have a sign error in your code,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:54.700,00:01:58.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,that makes kappa somehow negative, what are you going to have?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:00.980,00:02:04.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,You're going to have infinity pretty soon, okay?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:05.100,00:02:13.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because for the larger case, the exponential growth now is going to be very, very fast.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:14.960,00:02:19.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Actually, the finer the mesh is, which means the larger k can be containing your solution,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:20.160,00:02:23.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,the faster you are going to grow to infinity if you have a negative k.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:24.600,00:02:32.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that can be, that is the result if you have a negative k, okay?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:33.220,00:02:34.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,Exponential growth is very fast.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:36.160,00:02:40.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,In a computer, within a few iterations, you are going to see numbers like 10 to the 100,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:41.080,00:02:46.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,10 to the 200, and the floating points can only go up to 10 to the,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:46.160,00:02:49.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,double precision floating points can go to 10 to the 300.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:50.060,00:02:53.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,And beyond that, you're going to get infinity, okay?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:53.520,00:02:53.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:53.840,00:02:54.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:54.600,00:02:57.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's what you're going to see in computer code.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:57.840,00:03:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if you do some operations with infinities, you're going to get not a number.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:03.000,00:03:09.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in your code, I'm sure at some point you are going to see infinities and not a numbers.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:09.400,00:03:13.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,That can be a cause of exponential growth,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:14.440,00:03:17.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,very fast exponential growth in your computer code.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:20.200,00:03:20.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:20.960,00:03:22.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any other questions?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:24.580,00:03:27.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
