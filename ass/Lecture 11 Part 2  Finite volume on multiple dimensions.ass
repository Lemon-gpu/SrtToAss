Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:05.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,So multiple dimensions is really a slight extension of the finite volume
Dialogue: 0,00:00:05.160,00:00:11.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,scheme on a non-uniform grid. So in multiple dimensions, let's write our
Dialogue: 0,00:00:11.880,00:00:20.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,conservation law as partial u partial t plus the divergence of a flux vector
Dialogue: 0,00:00:20.920,00:00:30.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is a function of the solution u equal to 0. Okay and let's actually make
Dialogue: 0,00:00:30.680,00:00:37.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,a little bit more general form.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:37.620,00:00:45.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay is equal to a function g, let's say, which can also be a function
Dialogue: 0,00:00:45.480,00:00:50.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,few. So g is called the source term, that is the non-conventional
Dialogue: 0,00:00:50.920,00:00:56.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,conservative part of the equation. So in momentum conservation, for example,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:56.600,00:01:03.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,g can be a body force, gravity for example. In conservation of energy, g can
Dialogue: 0,00:01:03.760,00:01:09.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,be a source of energy coming from something else. Let's say if you are
Dialogue: 0,00:01:09.600,00:01:15.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,showing fluid dynamics equations, g can come from chemical reaction, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:15.980,00:01:18.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,So g is a source term.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:18.300,00:01:20.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,So u is a scale?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:20.300,00:01:20.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,Huh?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:20.800,00:01:20.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,u is a scale.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:20.900,00:01:26.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,g is a scalar. Yeah, g is also a scalar. f is a vector corresponding to two or three
Dialogue: 0,00:01:26.020,00:01:29.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,dimensions depending on how many spatial dimensions we have.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:29.660,00:01:33.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,The gradient of f, the gradient of f.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:33.660,00:01:41.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the gradient, no, this is the divergence. This is not the gradient. So f as a vector of u,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:41.220,00:01:50.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,I can write it as fx of u, fy of u, fz of u. These are different components.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:50.780,00:01:54.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is a differential equation. So f is a function of x, y, z components of the vector.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:54.620,00:02:04.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the divergence of this vector u is defined as the partial derivative of fx to x plus
Dialogue: 0,00:02:04.360,00:02:14.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,partial derivative of fy to y plus partial derivative of fz to z.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:14.620,00:02:20.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you apply the chain rule, because f is a function of u and u is a function of x, y and z.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:20.780,00:02:25.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you apply the chain rule, you're going to get partial fx.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:25.900,00:02:30.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is no longer partial because fx is a function of u.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:30.080,00:02:49.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,In this case, dfx du times partial u partial x plus dfy du times partial u partial y plus dfz du partial u partial z.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:49.360,00:02:50.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:50.660,00:03:04.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this can be written as df vector du dot with the gradient of u,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:04.880,00:03:19.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,where the gradient of u without the dot is defined as partial u partial x, partial u partial y and partial u partial z.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:20.660,00:03:21.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:22.560,00:03:33.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So depending on if you write the second term as the divergence of a flux or equal to a vector field, df du,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:33.960,00:03:36.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,dot with the gradient of the solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:37.780,00:03:41.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is two different differential forms of the same equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:43.340,00:03:45.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is the conservative form.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:46.240,00:03:47.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is what form?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:48.960,00:03:50.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,The primitive form.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:51.580,00:03:52.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that's the derivative form.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:52.840,00:03:56.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, we can write the first step, the derivative form, or the derivative form of the equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:56.320,00:03:57.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:57.320,00:04:05.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the first step in deriving a final volume is to take the conservative form of the equation
Dialogue: 0,00:04:05.200,00:04:09.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,and integrate to get the integral form.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:09.340,00:04:11.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:11.500,00:04:18.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we take, this is the conservative form.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:18.560,00:04:19.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is the primitive.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:19.860,00:04:20.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:20.660,00:04:29.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,we take the conservative form of equation we integrate
Dialogue: 0,00:04:29.300,00:04:45.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,integrate over space over a finite volume what we get is integration over a small volume let's say
Dialogue: 0,00:04:45.500,00:04:59.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,over V partial u partial t plus divergence of f of u is going to be equal to integration over the
Dialogue: 0,00:04:59.120,00:05:13.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,same V G of u DV let's say DV and the first term because V is a constant volume right in our setup
Dialogue: 0,00:05:13.500,00:05:15.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,V is a constant volume if V is a constant volume then we integrate over space over a finite volume
Dialogue: 0,00:05:15.480,00:05:22.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,actually changing as a function of time then there are more terms that is coming out but right
Dialogue: 0,00:05:22.980,00:05:32.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,now let's say we have a fixed fixed volume we have a fixed mesh and each cell each final volume is a
Dialogue: 0,00:05:32.360,00:05:44.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,stationary it's stationary in time what we get is DDT of the volume integrated you integrate over
Dialogue: 0,00:05:44.080,00:05:45.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,the volume plus the volume over the volume and then we integrate over the volume and then we get
Dialogue: 0,00:05:45.460,00:05:56.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,D and we apply the divergence theorem integral of the divergence of a vector is equal to integral
Dialogue: 0,00:05:56.220,00:06:07.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,over the boundary right so the the the nabla operator is exchanged is replaced by the normal
Dialogue: 0,00:06:07.540,00:06:15.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,the outward phase normal at the boundary dot with the same f of u DV becomes D s
Dialogue: 0,00:06:15.460,00:06:20.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,and this is equal to integration of G dv.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:24.160,00:06:26.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, and in final volume,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:26.880,00:06:31.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,we track something that is closely related
Dialogue: 0,00:06:31.020,00:06:34.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,to the cell integrals, which is the cell averages.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:35.420,00:06:40.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we divide both sides by the volume of the cell,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:41.320,00:06:43.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,by the volume of v.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:43.280,00:06:44.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's just call it v.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:45.460,00:06:50.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right, so this is the volume of the cell.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:51.280,00:06:53.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And again, if v is stationary,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:54.340,00:06:56.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,if the mesh is stationary as a function of time,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:56.960,00:06:59.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,we can take the v into the time derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:00.540,00:07:03.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in the final volume,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:03.500,00:07:08.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,so let's say if I have a cell and I discretize,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:08.620,00:07:12.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,if I have a space where I want the solution,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:12.540,00:07:15.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,if I divide the space into v,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:15.460,00:07:21.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v6, v7, et cetera,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:22.240,00:07:26.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,then the d dt of ui,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:26.760,00:07:30.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,where ui is defined as 1 over vi,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:30.960,00:07:33.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,the cell size,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:34.780,00:07:39.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,times the 1 over vi times the cell integral,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:40.020,00:07:43.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,this plus 1 over vi,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:43.440,00:07:43.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,right?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:45.460,00:07:49.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,Integrated over the boundary of vi.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:49.460,00:07:53.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for v1, the boundary is like this.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:53.260,00:07:55.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,For v2, the boundary is like this.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:55.580,00:07:57.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,For v3, the boundary is like this.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:58.040,00:08:12.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay? The surface normal dot with the flux vector ds is equal to gi,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:12.720,00:08:14.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is the cell average of d.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:14.780,00:08:14.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:14.840,00:08:15.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the normal.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:15.220,00:08:15.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the normal.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:15.280,00:08:15.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the normal.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:15.380,00:08:15.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the normal.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:15.680,00:08:18.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,g computed on the ith volume.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:19.940,00:08:22.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So up to now this is still exact.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:23.360,00:08:26.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,And now we start the approximation.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:30.760,00:08:33.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is still exact.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:35.440,00:08:38.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,The approximation is the following.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:39.080,00:08:41.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,We're going to approximate two things.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:41.400,00:08:44.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,We're going to approximate, first of all,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:44.500,00:08:53.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,this integral over the boundary of a cell, we're going to approximate the
Dialogue: 0,00:08:53.440,00:08:58.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,boundary as a piecewise constant. We are going to approximate this f as a
Dialogue: 0,00:08:58.680,00:09:07.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,piecewise constant function. So for example, let's take v2 as an
Dialogue: 0,00:09:07.300,00:09:13.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,example. v2 has one part of boundary interfacing with v1. It has one part of
Dialogue: 0,00:09:13.960,00:09:20.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,the boundary interfacing with v3, one part interfacing with v4, and one part
Dialogue: 0,00:09:20.740,00:09:30.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,interfacing with v5. And we can split up this integral over the entire boundary
Dialogue: 0,00:09:30.940,00:09:41.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,of vi into a summation of integrals. And the summation is over all the cells, all
Dialogue: 0,00:09:41.320,00:09:43.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,the boundaries.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:43.960,00:09:51.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,That over all the cells that are neighbor of that particular i. So I'm
Dialogue: 0,00:09:51.240,00:09:58.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,going to write it as j inside the neighbor mbr of i. j is defined as a
Dialogue: 0,00:09:58.720,00:10:06.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,neighbor of i if i and j shares a non-trivial interface. Right, so if the
Dialogue: 0,00:10:06.940,00:10:13.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,flow can go from cell i to cell j through a boundary.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:13.960,00:10:28.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is the phase normal between i and j. So this is the average phase
Dialogue: 0,00:10:28.280,00:10:38.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,normal between i and j. The dot with the flux between i and j and ds is going to
Dialogue: 0,00:10:38.960,00:10:41.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,be s i and j.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:41.200,00:10:43.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, this normal is the normal.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:43.960,00:10:53.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,This normal is the average, the normal of the interface s is the total amount of interface
Dialogue: 0,00:10:53.200,00:10:57.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,length.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:57.480,00:11:03.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,In particular this approximation is approximating this f as piecewise constant.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:03.060,00:11:12.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right so, and if we do that we can, we can say that the integration over partial, let
Dialogue: 0,00:11:12.280,00:11:13.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,me,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:13.280,00:11:26.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,over partial, over the boundary of i and j of n ds is going to be defined as n i j which
Dialogue: 0,00:11:26.120,00:11:31.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,is a unit vector times s i j which is a scalar.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:31.460,00:11:37.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay so, so if we, if we say f of u is a constant over the interface we can pull that f out of
Dialogue: 0,00:11:37.680,00:11:41.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,the integral and the integral is a purely geometric.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:41.800,00:11:42.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:43.280,00:11:44.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, weultan that f is just going to be plane on this surface, right.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:44.680,00:11:47.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, we can wonder that what's going on over here when we put沒有 i z to where's this
Dialogue: 0,00:11:47.720,00:11:49.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,particular, okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:49.040,00:12:01.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Remember we can't do that, you can't
Dialogue: 0,00:12:01.120,00:12:03.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,sticking your finger over the edge of this.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:03.740,00:12:06.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, we have a point S
Dialogue: 0,00:12:06.580,00:12:08.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,in the boundary, so creative delay, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:12:08.320,00:12:10.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes, and I want to figure out how to want to Personalize
Dialogue: 0,00:12:10.360,00:12:11.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,this data so what we're going to do is several times within this darren, that's why the big
Dialogue: 0,00:12:11.120,00:12:12.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,point.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:12.120,00:12:13.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, let's do it very quickly.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:13.120,00:12:24.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,is exactly orthogonal to the line connecting these two points. Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:24.580,00:12:34.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh that's a very good point. I'm thinking in two dimensions. If you have
Dialogue: 0,00:12:34.740,00:12:41.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,multiple dimensions, yes it's a plane, it's not just a line. So you will be
Dialogue: 0,00:12:41.080,00:12:49.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,integrating the face normal over a potentially non-trivial surface and the
Dialogue: 0,00:12:49.400,00:12:55.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,magnitude of that integral is going to be Sij, the direction of that integral is

Dialogue: 0,00:13:04.240,00:13:10.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,the mesh then. So this plus this is equal to, if we also approximate Gi as
Dialogue: 0,00:13:10.260,00:13:18.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,piecewise constant, then we are going to be applying G onto Ui. The function G
Dialogue: 0,00:13:18.780,00:13:25.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,applied into Ui is going to be my right hand side. So here if I can approximate
Dialogue: 0,00:13:25.680,00:13:38.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,the piecewise constant surface flux, if I can approximate Fij as a numerical flux,

Dialogue: 0,00:14:34.680,00:14:43.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,length more than zero. It's not a point. Yes. So for example, if you have a
