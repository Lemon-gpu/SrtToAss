Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:06.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Today we are going to be starting to talk about finite difference in 1D.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:06.260,00:00:11.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,The three main questions we want to answer in this class is how to approximate a
Dialogue: 0,00:00:11.400,00:00:17.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,partial differential equation in a form that a computer can implement and solve.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:17.520,00:00:27.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is an approximation, it's not an exact solution. So how accurate or how
Dialogue: 0,00:00:27.040,00:00:32.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,inaccurate, which is the same question, is our approximation? Well how do we find
Dialogue: 0,00:00:32.280,00:00:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,out? And a part of this question is how do we construct approximations that are
Dialogue: 0,00:00:40.000,00:00:49.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,as accurate as possible in some sense while as easy to implement and easy for
Dialogue: 0,00:00:49.220,00:00:53.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,the computer to solve as possible. And the third question is how does the
Dialogue: 0,00:00:53.880,00:00:56.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,approximation affect our solution?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:56.540,00:00:57.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this looks like a very simple problem.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:57.040,00:01:05.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,It looks like a weird question, but it is not. There is a difference between how
Dialogue: 0,00:01:05.480,00:01:13.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,much error is it in the approximation of the PDE and when you solve it how much
Dialogue: 0,00:01:13.540,00:01:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,error is in the solution. So these are two different things. We're going to look
Dialogue: 0,00:01:18.000,00:01:23.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,at why they are two different things and how one, the approximation error, affects
Dialogue: 0,00:01:23.280,00:01:26.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,the solution error. What's the link between them?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:26.540,00:01:33.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So first of all let's discuss, find a difference for the heat equation. The heat
Dialogue: 0,00:01:33.860,00:01:40.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,equation is again partial u, partial t equal to a kappa times partial square u
Dialogue: 0,00:01:40.600,00:01:48.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,partial x square. And this equation is both of the terms appears in the project
Dialogue: 0,00:01:48.500,00:01:52.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,you have to do. So the behavior of this equation is going to be reflected in your numerical system.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:52.540,00:01:54.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the behavior of this equation is going to be reflected in your numerical system.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:56.540,00:01:58.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the behavior of this equation is going to be reflected in your numerical system.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:58.540,00:02:00.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the behavior of this equation is going to be reflected in your numerical system.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:00.540,00:02:06.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,And for the heat equation, the main thing we want to approximate is the spatial derivative
Dialogue: 0,00:02:06.540,00:02:14.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,term. Because if we can discretize the spatial derivative term and remove the spatial derivative,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:14.540,00:02:18.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,partial x, from the equation, what do we get?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:18.540,00:02:26.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,We get an OD because we only have one derivative, we only have time derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:26.040,00:02:36.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,And for that OD, if we are given an initial condition, we can put it in any OD solver and solve it.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:36.040,00:02:44.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for most of you who prefers MATLAB, you probably know OD45.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:44.040,00:02:54.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for those of you who prefers Python, if you import scipy, there is scipy.integrate, and it has pretty good OD integrators.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:54.040,00:02:55.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for those of you who prefers Python, if you import scipy, there is scipy.integrate, and it has pretty good OD integrators.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:56.040,00:02:58.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for those of you who prefers Python, if you import scipy, there is scipy.integrate, and it has pretty good OD integrators.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:58.040,00:03:06.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright, if you don't know that, you should reconsider your option of choosing Python.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:06.040,00:03:08.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright, if you don't know that, you should reconsider your option of choosing Python.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:08.040,00:03:16.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,But the main goal is to get rid of the spatial derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:16.040,00:03:20.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so how do we get rid of the spatial derivative?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:20.040,00:03:24.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,We first need to approximate the solution, u as a function of x and t.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:24.040,00:03:26.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,We first need to approximate the solution, u as a function of x and t.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:26.040,00:03:33.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,We want to approximate it as something of just a function of t.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:33.040,00:03:38.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,And let's look at what are the options of doing that.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:38.040,00:03:41.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Going to MATLAB.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:41.040,00:03:46.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to run two demos.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:46.040,00:03:54.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the two demos is going to illustrate two different options of approximating a function of x
Dialogue: 0,00:03:54.040,00:03:57.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,and t.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:57.040,00:04:01.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the two demos is going to illustrate two different options of approximating a function of x and t.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:01.040,00:04:06.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So first of all, I'm going to tell you how a finite difference approximates a function.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:06.040,00:04:15.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then I'm going to tell you how a finite volume, which is the second method of discretization, is going to approximate a function.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:15.040,00:04:17.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So here we go.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:17.040,00:04:20.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,And again, I will ask somebody to draw a function.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:20.040,00:04:23.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we'll see how on this 11-grid graph, we can get the final result.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:23.040,00:04:30.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you have 11 grid points, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 grid points and 10 intervals,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:30.040,00:04:36.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,how a finite difference is going to approximate your function?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:36.040,00:04:37.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:37.040,00:04:49.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Please.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:49.040,00:04:52.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,By the way, I have uploaded my script for letting you draw a function.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:52.040,00:04:54.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you have any questions, please feel free to ask me.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:54.040,00:04:56.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I will also be happy to answer any questions you may have.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:56.040,00:04:58.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Thank you.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:58.040,00:04:59.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,What's your name?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:59.040,00:05:00.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Zach.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:00.040,00:05:01.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Zach.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:01.040,00:05:02.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,OK.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:02.040,00:05:04.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Zach's function is nice and smooth.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:04.040,00:05:05.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:05.040,00:05:06.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's good.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:06.040,00:05:13.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,And his function is still shown in the thin red line on screen.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:13.040,00:05:15.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,But the computer is going to find a difference.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:15.040,00:05:19.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's going to forget about the whole function Zach has drawn.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:19.040,00:05:21.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the computer only remembers the same thing.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:21.040,00:05:25.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,It remembers the circles.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:25.040,00:05:29.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,What are the circles?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:29.040,00:05:38.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,They are just the values of the function at these grid points at the set of spatial locations.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:38.040,00:05:41.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's how finite difference approximates a function.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:41.040,00:05:46.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's basically the most straightforward way of approximating a continuous function.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:46.040,00:05:48.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:48.040,00:05:50.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we are going to see a little bit later on
Dialogue: 0,00:05:50.040,00:05:54.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,that finite volume is going to do things differently.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:54.040,00:05:55.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,OK.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:55.040,00:05:58.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's actually run the demo here.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:58.040,00:06:02.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I'm trying to reproduce the function Zach has drawn.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:02.040,00:06:07.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Maybe I'm doing that not so good.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:07.040,00:06:13.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is actually how finite volume approximates roughly the same function.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:13.040,00:06:16.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Instead of circles, we get lines.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:16.040,00:06:19.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,And what are these lines?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:19.040,00:06:21.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Anybody take a guess?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:21.040,00:06:22.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:22.040,00:06:28.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Average value of the function in the intervals.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:28.040,00:06:32.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So finite volume has nothing to do with the grid points.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:32.040,00:06:34.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,It looks at intervals.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:34.040,00:06:37.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,It decomposes the domain into small intervals
Dialogue: 0,00:06:37.040,00:06:42.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,and approximates the function using the average values inside these intervals.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:42.040,00:06:46.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's how finite volume discretizes function.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:46.040,00:06:49.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,But this class, we are going to discuss finite difference.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:49.040,00:06:54.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Which is approximating a function using the values at the grid points.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:54.040,00:06:56.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,OK.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:56.040,00:06:59.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we'll see advantages and disadvantages.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:59.040,00:07:01.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,The advantage, of course, is simplicity.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:01.040,00:07:06.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's a lot simpler to just think of the function value at individual grid points.
