Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:08.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's now start talking about what if I'm not happy with just the energy norm?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:08.160,00:00:12.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,What if I want a more general norm?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:12.260,00:00:19.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,How can I say that the finite element solution, how good is the finite element solution in some other norm?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:20.420,00:00:28.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,It turns out in some other norm I can no longer say that, so for example, if I look at the H1 norm, so u minus uh.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:30.000,00:00:34.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,I can no longer say that this is optimal.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:34.540,00:00:47.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,In fact, this is not going to be optimal in all possible finite dimensional, in all possible members of the finite dimensional space.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:47.700,00:00:49.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,But I can bound this.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:49.520,00:00:59.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,I can bound this to be some number times u minus wh.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:00.000,00:01:09.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,For all possible wh's in this finite dimensional space.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:11.360,00:01:14.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I can do that by the following.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:15.060,00:01:20.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,So first of all, let's define what is u minus uh in the H1 norm.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:21.320,00:01:28.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So u minus uh in the H1 norm is the summation of two parts.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:29.280,00:01:29.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:30.000,00:01:45.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,One is the integration of u minus uh squared plus the derivative of u minus uh squared dx.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:47.920,00:01:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,No, no, I actually don't need that because I can just start.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:52.760,00:01:54.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,I don't need to use the Poincare inequality again.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:54.860,00:01:59.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,I can just start by saying that.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:00.000,00:02:02.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,The energy norm is coercive.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:02.960,00:02:04.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,The bilinear form is coercive.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:05.300,00:02:16.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what I can say is that u minus uh in the H1 norm squared is less or equal to 1 over b times the energy norm.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:18.680,00:02:27.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we know that the energy norm is the energy norm is the minimizer.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:27.160,00:02:29.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is less or equal to 1 over b of u.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:30.000,00:02:31.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we can just write u minus wh.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:32.040,00:02:33.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,u minus wh.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:34.580,00:02:38.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,For all the possible wh's in xh.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:41.500,00:02:47.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,And also, let's use the continuity of this bilinear form here.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:48.140,00:02:59.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,So by continuity, this is less than c times the norm of u minus uh squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:00.000,00:03:01.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,And also, this is less than c times the norm of u minus wh.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:01.680,00:03:10.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the error in H1 norm is not exactly minimized.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:10.560,00:03:14.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,But it is close to minimum in a certain sense.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:14.380,00:03:28.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,It is close to minimum in that the error is not going to be greater than a certain finite constant times the minimum error you can achieve.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:28.700,00:03:29.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the error in H1 norm is not going to be greater than a certain finite constant times the minimum error you can achieve.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:29.480,00:03:29.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the error in H2 norm is not going to be greater than a certain finite constant times the minimum error you can achieve.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:29.980,00:03:30.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the error in H2 norm is not going to be greater than a certain finite constant times the minimum error you can achieve.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:30.480,00:03:30.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:30.980,00:03:45.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,So because this can be for any wh, the same inequality also is true for the wh that minimizes the norm.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:45.980,00:03:53.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it is less than this times the infinimum or the minimum of wh in xh.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:54.540,00:03:56.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,u minus wh.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:59.480,00:04:08.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, now with that, we can start looking at what rate of convergence do we have.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:08.240,00:04:17.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So infinite difference, we can analyze the order of accuracy of the differential operator.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:17.240,00:04:17.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:17.740,00:04:24.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if we use a central difference to approximate a first order derivative, we know the error goes down like delta x squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:24.540,00:04:27.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if we use a central difference to approximate a first order derivative, we know the error goes down like delta x squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:27.980,00:04:28.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you use a forward difference, you can see that the error goes down like delta x squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:28.540,00:04:33.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you use a forward difference or backward difference, we know the error goes down only with delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:33.540,00:04:40.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So here we can do the same analysis here, infinite element, once we have that inequality.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:40.540,00:04:44.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because this inequality holds for any wh.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:44.540,00:04:51.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we can easily construct a delta h, construct a wh for which we know the order of accuracy.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:51.540,00:04:57.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we know that the same order of accuracy is going to apply for the same order of accuracy.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:57.540,00:04:58.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we know that the same order of accuracy is going to apply for the same order of accuracy.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:58.540,00:05:01.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we do that even if you are only sure that the
Dialogue: 0,00:05:01.520,00:05:12.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is because if you look at the c and b here, the c and b here are the properties of this a, of this bilinear form, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:12.520,00:05:20.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,It has nothing to do with h, it has nothing to do with what kind of approximation we are making.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:20.520,00:05:25.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,It has nothing to do with the specific x-h, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:25.520,00:05:28.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, if we can construct a w, which is anyway a deeper string, minus a one culture, which is anyway a developer code,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:28.540,00:05:39.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that also means as we refine the mesh, as we refine the mesh, which also makes the XH to be richer and richer,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:39.880,00:05:45.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,has more and more approximation power, the C over B is not going to change.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:46.920,00:05:52.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, that allows us to build specific WHs.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:52.100,00:05:57.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,For example, what the WHs we are using here is an interpolant.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:58.540,00:06:02.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's say we have a U, so that is the green one is U.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:03.700,00:06:12.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we have a finite element mesh over here that restricts our approximation UH to be piecewise linear functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:13.020,00:06:19.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So why don't we construct WHs that actually goes through these grid points.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:20.620,00:06:25.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is going to be our WH.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:27.300,00:06:28.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,So WH.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:28.540,00:06:33.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is just connecting the dots on the function.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:34.820,00:06:38.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,Of course, the WH is in the space, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:38.460,00:06:40.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,We are trying to approximate.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:42.940,00:06:49.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,And so let's start to analyze what is the, what is this approximation error in H1?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:50.620,00:06:52.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the approximation error in H1.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:53.900,00:06:55.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's, let's call this WH.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:56.020,00:06:57.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,Uh, this is particular.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:58.540,00:07:02.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's call the interpolant of U.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:03.140,00:07:04.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I begot interpolant.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:04.980,00:07:08.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's with the H because it's on the particular mesh.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:08.940,00:07:13.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's figure out what is this U minus interpolant?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:15.140,00:07:17.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,What is this approximation error?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:18.660,00:07:20.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Of course, it has two terms.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:20.820,00:07:28.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,It has one term that is the L2 error of the interpolant.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:28.540,00:07:39.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,And also another term that is the L2 error of the derivative of the interpolant.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:39.220,00:07:43.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's figure out these two terms one by one.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:43.220,00:07:50.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the point here is to see how does this error decrease as my refine my mesh.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:50.340,00:07:57.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,If I know, for example, the error decreases like delta X square as a refined mesh.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:57.820,00:08:06.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then I know that the U minus UH is also going to decrease like delta X square as a refined mesh.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:07.580,00:08:14.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because this, this C over B doesn't change as I refine the mesh.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:14.820,00:08:15.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:16.020,00:08:16.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:17.860,00:08:22.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, so, so here we go back to Taylor series analysis.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:23.740,00:08:26.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we look at first, we need to analyze how big.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:26.420,00:08:35.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is this approximately how, what is the maximum difference between the red line and the green line?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:36.340,00:08:41.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's first look at the maximum difference between the derivatives.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:43.340,00:08:46.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,And in order to do that, I need to use.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:46.340,00:08:55.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, so first of all, the derivative of the interpolant over a interval is going to be constant, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:55.460,00:08:56.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's going to be.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:56.380,00:09:00.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,You add grid point.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:00.100,00:09:02.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,I plus one minus you.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:02.300,00:09:06.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,I divided by X I plus one minus X I.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:06.300,00:09:13.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's the slope of these curve over that interval over the element.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:13.300,00:09:24.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now what we need to do is we need to use what's called the mean value theorem.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:24.300,00:09:24.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:24.580,00:09:24.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,So.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:24.700,00:09:24.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So.

Dialogue: 0,00:09:41.900,00:09:51.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then I think we can let Dimidex out and find the maximum on thecity level here.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:51.260,00:09:52.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Dad with no problem.

Dialogue: 0,00:09:55.400,00:09:55.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,Thank you.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:55.820,00:10:04.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,here. The proof is pretty simple. So if all the du, dx's are above that value, then you cannot
Dialogue: 0,00:10:04.620,00:10:10.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,average to this value. If all the du, dx's below that value, you cannot also average to that value,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:10.340,00:10:18.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,right? So that means you have to have a certain point du, dx's greater or equal, another point

Dialogue: 0,00:10:23.980,00:10:33.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,point where du, dx's is exactly equal to this value, where xi is somewhere between xi and xi plus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:35.500,00:10:46.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right. So now we have this. Then du, dx's at any point in eta, that is within the space,

Dialogue: 0,00:11:23.980,00:11:33.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's say h is the maximum where h is the maximum of xi plus 1 minus xi.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:35.100,00:11:42.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right. So this is order h because eta and xi are both in the interval xi and xi plus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:43.440,00:11:46.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the difference between eta and xi has to be o h.
