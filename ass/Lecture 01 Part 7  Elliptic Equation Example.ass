Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the second equation we are going to look at is another limiting case. So that's actually limiting case number two.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:10.680,00:00:18.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,An elliptic equation. So that is the case where u is equal to zero and t goes to infinity.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:21.040,00:00:27.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,We have just said that when u is equal to zero, we get the heat equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:27.240,00:00:36.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,If we have f equal to zero. And as t goes to infinity on that heat equation, we recover a constant.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:37.240,00:00:42.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that is in the case where we don't have a right-hand side f.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:42.080,00:00:54.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,If we do have a right-hand side f, the equation becomes kappa times partial square u partial x squared plus f is equal to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:57.240,00:01:01.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we can in general study the case where kappa is equal to one.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:01.880,00:01:07.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because if kappa is not equal to one, as long as it is non-zero, we can divide the whole equation by kappa.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:07.880,00:01:12.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we replace f with f divided by kappa. And we get the same thing.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:12.880,00:01:18.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's remove this kappa from this equation and study that.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:18.880,00:01:23.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,This equation is called the Poisson's equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:27.240,00:01:40.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the solution to that equation can also be analyzed using Fourier series.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:40.240,00:01:46.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in this case, we only have x. We don't have t.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:46.240,00:01:52.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,And strictly speaking, this is an OD. We should have d instead of partials.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:52.240,00:01:55.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,But most of the time when we talk about Poisson's equation,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:55.240,00:01:56.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,we are describing the Poisson's equation as a partial square.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:57.240,00:01:59.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we are discussing multiple dimensions in space.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:59.240,00:02:05.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let me write this as a partial, even in the one-dimensional space case.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:05.240,00:02:10.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,We are going to expand u of x using Fourier series again.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:10.240,00:02:13.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,k equal to minus infinity to infinity.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:13.240,00:02:21.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,u hat of k, u to the i kx.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:21.240,00:02:27.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the second derivative is going to become b.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:27.240,00:02:34.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we are going to have minus k is equal to minus infinity to infinity.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:34.240,00:02:40.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,k square times u hat of k times e to the i kx.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:40.240,00:02:45.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay. I'm also going to expand f, which can be a function of time,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:45.240,00:02:48.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,using Fourier series.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:48.240,00:02:55.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,We have f hat of k instead of u hat of k for the coefficients of f.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:55.240,00:03:03.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, matching the two sides of the equation, both using Fourier expansion,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:03.240,00:03:08.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,we have, if we plus that equal to zero,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:08.240,00:03:17.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,what we have is k square of u hat of k has to equal to f hat of k.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:17.240,00:03:24.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay. So what does that mean?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:24.240,00:03:28.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,What does this equation mean for k equal to zero,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:28.240,00:03:34.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,for k equal to a small number, small can include negative or positive,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:34.240,00:03:43.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,for small absolute value k, and for a large absolute value k?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:43.240,00:03:48.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,For k equal to zero, we can see that f hat of k has to be zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:48.240,00:03:53.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Otherwise, we don't have a solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:53.240,00:03:57.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's because the domain is periodic.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:57.240,00:04:01.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,And as we take t to infinity for the heat equation case,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:01.240,00:04:04.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,the f is like a heat source.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:04.240,00:04:10.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's like a source of thermal energy that pumps into the domain.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:10.240,00:04:16.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you have a non-zero average or a non-zero integral
Dialogue: 0,00:04:16.240,00:04:19.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,in the amount of heat you pump into the system,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:19.240,00:04:22.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,then the temperature is going to keep increasing to infinity
Dialogue: 0,00:04:22.240,00:04:23.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,or keep decreasing.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:23.240,00:04:26.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you have a non-zero average or a non-zero integral
Dialogue: 0,00:04:26.240,00:04:28.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,in the amount of heat you pump into the system,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:28.240,00:04:31.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,then the temperature is going to keep increasing to minus infinity.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:31.240,00:04:34.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,You don't have a steady state solution,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:34.240,00:04:36.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is what this equation is describing,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:36.240,00:04:40.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,a steady state solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:40.240,00:04:43.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,You will only have a steady state solution
Dialogue: 0,00:04:43.240,00:04:47.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,if f hat of zero is equal to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:47.240,00:04:52.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's the first thing this equation tells me.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:52.240,00:04:57.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,f hat, for the other case, it can be arbitrary value.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:57.240,00:05:01.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then I can have a solution u hat of k
Dialogue: 0,00:05:01.240,00:05:09.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,is equal to f hat of k divided by k square.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:09.240,00:05:11.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:11.240,00:05:14.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it takes the Fourier components of f
Dialogue: 0,00:05:14.240,00:05:17.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,and divide it by k square.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:17.240,00:05:19.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Divided by small number for small k
Dialogue: 0,00:05:19.240,00:05:21.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,by a big number for big k.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:22.240,00:05:28.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is almost a filtering in space,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:28.240,00:05:31.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,a low pass filtering in space.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:31.240,00:05:35.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because it takes the very high weight numbers,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:35.240,00:05:40.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,takes the very oscillatory components of f
Dialogue: 0,00:05:40.240,00:05:45.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,and decrease that by a large factor
Dialogue: 0,00:05:45.240,00:05:49.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,while taking the smoother components of f
Dialogue: 0,00:05:49.240,00:05:51.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,and decrease that only by
Dialogue: 0,00:05:51.240,00:05:56.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,a smaller factor.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:56.240,00:05:59.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is a,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:59.240,00:06:01.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,some variation of this, this equation
Dialogue: 0,00:06:01.240,00:06:04.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,has been used in numerical methods
Dialogue: 0,00:06:04.240,00:06:08.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,to serve as a filter, a low pass filter.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:08.240,00:06:11.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is called a differential filter
Dialogue: 0,00:06:11.240,00:06:14.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,because it uses a differential operator
Dialogue: 0,00:06:14.240,00:06:17.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,to achieve the effect of removing
Dialogue: 0,00:06:17.240,00:06:19.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,the high frequency components while preserving
Dialogue: 0,00:06:19.240,00:06:21.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,the low frequency components.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:21.240,00:06:24.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:24.240,00:06:28.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's the effect of the second limiting case
Dialogue: 0,00:06:28.240,00:06:32.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,of time goes to infinity while the u is equal to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:32.240,00:06:33.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Question?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:33.240,00:06:36.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,What's the condition that you wrote next to the bracket
Dialogue: 0,00:06:36.240,00:06:38.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,when equals zero?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:38.240,00:06:42.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, I'm saying these two terms added together
Dialogue: 0,00:06:42.240,00:06:44.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,has to be equal to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:44.240,00:06:45.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:45.240,00:06:47.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:51.240,00:06:54.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's substituting these into the differential equation,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:54.240,00:06:56.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,into the Poisson's equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:56.240,00:06:57.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Thanks.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:57.240,00:06:58.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:58.240,00:06:59.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any other questions?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:59.240,00:07:00.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Thanks for clarifying.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:00.240,00:07:01.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:01.240,00:07:03.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Why is there only a steady state solution
Dialogue: 0,00:07:03.240,00:07:05.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,if f naught is equal to zero?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:05.240,00:07:08.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Why is there only a steady state solution
Dialogue: 0,00:07:08.240,00:07:10.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,when f naught is equal to zero?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:10.240,00:07:15.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is because if f naught is not equal to zero,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:15.240,00:07:20.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,okay, so for example, if f is equal to one as a constant,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:20.240,00:07:24.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,that means f naught is equal to one and all the other f hats
Dialogue: 0,00:07:24.240,00:07:27.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,are equal to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:27.240,00:07:34.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you actually add the time derivative term,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:34.240,00:07:43.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,so let's actually analyze the other case.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:43.240,00:07:44.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:44.240,00:07:47.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you write down a partial derivative of t
Dialogue: 0,00:07:47.240,00:07:50.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,is equal to kappa partial square u,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:50.240,00:07:53.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,partial x square plus f,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:53.240,00:07:56.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,and let's say u naught,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:56.240,00:08:00.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,u of x, t equal to zero is equal to,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:00.240,00:08:05.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,is equal to any, let's say is equal to zero
Dialogue: 0,00:08:05.240,00:08:08.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,and f of x is equal to a constant one.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:08.240,00:08:09.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:09.240,00:08:17.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,What is the solution going to be?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:17.240,00:08:20.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Can you just look at the initial condition?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:20.240,00:08:22.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,The right hand side and the equation
Dialogue: 0,00:08:22.240,00:08:26.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,and guess what the solution should be?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:26.240,00:08:27.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Linear growth.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:27.240,00:08:28.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Linear growth.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:28.240,00:08:34.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,I would have u of x and t equal to t, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:34.240,00:08:38.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,That solution is always a constant of in space,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:38.240,00:08:41.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,so the second of the derivative in space goes to zero
Dialogue: 0,00:08:41.240,00:08:43.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the time derivative is always equal to one
Dialogue: 0,00:08:43.240,00:08:45.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,which matches the right hand side.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:45.240,00:08:49.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I would have linear growth.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:49.240,00:08:50.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:50.240,00:08:53.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,And by the principle of linear superposition,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:53.240,00:08:57.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,if you have any initial condition and any f,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:57.240,00:09:01.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,as long as the f naught term is not equal to zero,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:01.240,00:09:05.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,you can express the solution as a linear combination
Dialogue: 0,00:09:05.240,00:09:09.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,of a solution that has f equal to zero
Dialogue: 0,00:09:09.240,00:09:13.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,and another solution that is equal to this.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:13.240,00:09:16.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that solution with f naught is equal to zero
Dialogue: 0,00:09:16.240,00:09:17.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,is going to stay bounded
Dialogue: 0,00:09:17.240,00:09:19.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,and this solution grows
Dialogue: 0,00:09:19.240,00:09:20.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,to infinity.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:20.240,00:09:23.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So when you perform linear superposition
Dialogue: 0,00:09:23.240,00:09:24.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,of these two solutions,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:24.240,00:09:28.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,you're going to get a solution that goes to infinity.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:28.240,00:09:34.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So there doesn't exist a steady state solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:34.240,00:09:35.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:35.240,00:09:39.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Could you please go to the previous slide?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:39.240,00:09:40.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,This might be a very long question,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:40.240,00:09:42.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,but the baseline counterline,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:42.240,00:09:47.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,isn't that one fully dictating that f naught should be zero?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:47.240,00:09:48.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because with p equal to zero,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:48.240,00:09:49.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,we have zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:49.240,00:09:51.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So zero equals f zero.

Dialogue: 0,00:09:52.240,00:09:53.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Isn't that just that?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:53.240,00:09:54.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:54.240,00:09:56.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's a mathematical way of answering the question
Dialogue: 0,00:09:56.240,00:10:00.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,why f hat of zero has to be zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:00.240,00:10:02.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the physical way to answer the question
Dialogue: 0,00:10:02.240,00:10:06.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,is what I was describing.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:06.240,00:10:09.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:09.240,00:10:11.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any other questions?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:11.240,00:10:12.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in this case,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:12.240,00:10:14.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,f is only an explicit function of x
Dialogue: 0,00:10:14.240,00:10:17.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,rather than some function of u?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:17.240,00:10:18.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, yes.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:18.240,00:10:19.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,In this case,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:19.240,00:10:21.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,f is a function of x only.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:21.240,00:10:23.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's not a function of u.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:23.240,00:10:24.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, that's right.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:24.240,00:10:27.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if f is a function of u,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:27.240,00:10:30.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,then especially if f is a nonlinear function of u,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:30.240,00:10:34.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,then we get into the field of nonlinear differential equations
Dialogue: 0,00:10:34.240,00:10:38.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,that cannot be analyzed using Fourier series.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:38.240,00:10:40.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:40.240,00:10:41.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:41.240,00:10:44.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any other questions?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:44.240,00:10:47.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that's a great case for solving the equation numerically.
