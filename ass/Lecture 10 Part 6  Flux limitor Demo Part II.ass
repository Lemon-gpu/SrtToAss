Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:14.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,right no okay so F is equal to good enough of UI plus just copy and paste
Dialogue: 0,00:00:14.440,00:00:22.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,UI plus half left UI plus half right I'm going to code up the good enough scheme
Dialogue: 0,00:00:22.920,00:00:42.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,over here you L and you are okay so just to review our good enough scheme so the
Dialogue: 0,00:00:42.120,00:00:49.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,flux is going to be taking either maximum or minimum depending on which you L or
Dialogue: 0,00:00:49.340,00:00:52.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,you are is larger right
Dialogue: 0,00:00:52.920,00:01:01.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,so so let me just so when we are taking maximum or minimum for burgers flux
Dialogue: 0,00:01:01.780,00:01:10.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,burgers it can only be taking three possible values it can either FL is
Dialogue: 0,00:01:10.940,00:01:21.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,equal to UL square over 2 F right is equal to UR square over 2 or F mean is
Dialogue: 0,00:01:21.680,00:01:22.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,equal to Z
Dialogue: 0,00:01:22.920,00:01:29.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,right so so because when we are taking the maximum and minimum of the flux over
Dialogue: 0,00:01:29.620,00:01:37.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,a range of U values and the minimum or maximum depending on which side of U is
Dialogue: 0,00:01:37.540,00:01:44.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,going to be larger and because the burgers flux is U square over 2 it's a
Dialogue: 0,00:01:44.060,00:01:49.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,convex function and because it's a convex function when whenever we are
Dialogue: 0,00:01:49.100,00:01:52.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,taking the maximum the maximum can
Dialogue: 0,00:01:52.820,00:01:59.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,it can only be possible on one of the ends it's either F left or F right
Dialogue: 0,00:01:59.360,00:02:14.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,right so so burgers the floor is like this F as a function of U so whenever
Dialogue: 0,00:02:14.340,00:02:19.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,we have a range of U taking the maximum over the range can either a go on this
Dialogue: 0,00:02:19.500,00:02:20.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,side or this side
Dialogue: 0,00:02:20.720,00:02:27.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well, taking the minimum can be different.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:27.260,00:02:33.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if I'm taking the minimum over a monotonically increasing or decreasing region, the minimum
Dialogue: 0,00:02:33.000,00:02:34.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,occurs on one side.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:34.680,00:02:41.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,But if the range of U overlaps with U equal to zero, then the minimum actually happens
Dialogue: 0,00:02:41.160,00:02:42.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,to be zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:42.160,00:02:45.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's why I'm writing fmin is equal to zero here.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:45.440,00:02:48.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,So several cases.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:48.140,00:03:01.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So first, let me just say f is equal to zero's length of U .
Dialogue: 0,00:03:01.200,00:03:05.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, length of U .
Dialogue: 0,00:03:05.180,00:03:10.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm making a function of this length.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:10.980,00:03:18.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So f over the region of U is greater than U .
Dialogue: 0,00:03:18.120,00:03:29.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,So when U is greater than U , should we take the minimum or maximum?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:29.280,00:03:36.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,U greater than U , we should be taking the maximum, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:36.160,00:03:43.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it is equal to, when we have a maximum, it doesn't matter, is it max or maximum in
Dialogue: 0,00:03:43.380,00:03:44.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,MATLAB?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:44.380,00:03:45.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,Max.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:45.380,00:03:46.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,Max, okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:46.380,00:03:47.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is f and f ?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:47.380,00:03:47.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:48.120,00:03:51.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So f and f are.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:51.680,00:03:54.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:54.560,00:04:03.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this makes sense because when both are positive, when both are positive, so over
Dialogue: 0,00:04:03.940,00:04:15.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,this region, over this region, so if I have U left, U ,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:15.260,00:04:17.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,right?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:18.120,00:04:25.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,I have a shockwave like that, and the flux should be taken on the left, which is U and
Dialogue: 0,00:04:25.680,00:04:26.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,this is the maximum.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:26.680,00:04:27.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, that's good.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:27.680,00:04:28.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:28.680,00:04:41.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So f less or equal to U is going to be equal to the minimum of f and f .
Dialogue: 0,00:04:41.680,00:04:42.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,And f less or equal to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:42.680,00:04:43.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:43.680,00:04:44.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So f less or equal to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:44.680,00:04:45.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:45.680,00:04:46.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So f less or equal to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:46.680,00:04:47.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:47.680,00:04:58.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So f less or equal to zero and U and the zero less or equal to U should be equal to
Dialogue: 0,00:04:58.240,00:04:59.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,f .
Dialogue: 0,00:04:59.240,00:05:02.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So these are the three cases.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:02.240,00:05:03.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:03.240,00:05:08.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the case when U is less than U , which means we should be taking the
Dialogue: 0,00:05:08.920,00:05:14.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,minimum and that U and U overlaps with the region of zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:14.800,00:05:16.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,And by taking minimum, we are not taking one side.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:16.920,00:05:21.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,We are taking the minimum inside that range, which is zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:21.280,00:05:25.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the Berger's Goodenow scheme.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:25.160,00:05:26.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:26.680,00:05:29.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's try it.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:29.080,00:05:32.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm sure I still have box somewhere, but let's do it anyway.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:32.660,00:05:38.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's make a, okay, x interface.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:38.980,00:05:42.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's still use what we had in the last lecture.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:42.700,00:05:45.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,X would be equal to the cell averages.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:45.760,00:05:53.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,And U is equal to sine of x times two pi.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:53.120,00:05:58.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So x and U is still the same as what we have in the last lecture.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:58.260,00:05:59.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's good.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:59.920,00:06:03.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's make U zero equal to U again.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:03.500,00:06:10.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,And let's use the DDT.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:10.700,00:06:12.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,We call it Berger's.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:12.720,00:06:14.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,We solve it for this much.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:14.520,00:06:15.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:15.520,00:06:16.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,So starting debugging.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:16.520,00:06:17.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,Error in this.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:17.520,00:06:22.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, A and B must be the same.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:22.520,00:06:27.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's actually the maximum of these within that range.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:27.320,00:06:32.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's max of this and min of this.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:32.540,00:06:34.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,And here should be the same.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:34.640,00:06:40.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,It should be FL of this and FR of that.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:40.280,00:06:42.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:42.360,00:06:43.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's try again.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:43.360,00:06:44.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:44.360,00:06:56.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, so here, if I go back up to here, return the vector of length 1 0 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:56.920,00:06:58.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, I see.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:58.000,00:06:58.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:58.540,00:07:03.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,So here we actually computed i plus half.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:03.360,00:07:07.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we shouldn't have this anymore, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:07.360,00:07:11.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,So because we only need i goes when, so for i plus half, we need, it goes from minus one to n.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:11.880,00:07:13.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,Do this again.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:13.360,00:07:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we have a solution. So let's look at it.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:17.380,00:07:19.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Plot x u.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:21.100,00:07:23.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right. So that way we, so you see
Dialogue: 0,00:07:23.880,00:07:27.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,something different from what we got in the last lecture, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:27.820,00:07:31.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we no longer, on the same grid, we no longer
Dialogue: 0,00:07:31.740,00:07:36.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,see the minimum of this decaying as the wave propagates
Dialogue: 0,00:07:36.220,00:07:40.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,towards the right. So that's the good thing about
Dialogue: 0,00:07:40.180,00:07:43.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,a second order accurate scheme. That is, when we have the wave
Dialogue: 0,00:07:43.960,00:07:48.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,going, we no longer, in smooth regions, we no longer have that much
Dialogue: 0,00:07:48.240,00:07:51.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,dissipation error. The maximum of the solution no longer
Dialogue: 0,00:07:51.740,00:07:55.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,seems to decrease over time.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:55.520,00:07:58.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,We no longer see this weird gap over here.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:59.360,00:08:02.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,And just to remind you what we have before,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:03.280,00:08:07.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,the easiest case is to set phi
Dialogue: 0,00:08:07.300,00:08:10.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,is equal to zero. So that's our
Dialogue: 0,00:08:10.160,00:08:13.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,first order scheme.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:16.740,00:08:18.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,And plot this again.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:19.140,00:08:23.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,What we have is this curious gap over here
Dialogue: 0,00:08:23.000,00:08:26.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,that it decreases the maximum of the solution and
Dialogue: 0,00:08:26.900,00:08:31.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,increases the minimum of the solution. And by having
Dialogue: 0,00:08:31.000,00:08:32.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,a proper
Dialogue: 0,00:08:32.280,00:08:38.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,limiter, we no longer have that.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:38.020,00:08:42.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright, so previously we have a case that violates,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:42.020,00:08:44.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,so if we set phi equal to zero, we
Dialogue: 0,00:08:44.320,00:08:49.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,violate the condition that phi has to be,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:50.720,00:08:51.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,we violate
Dialogue: 0,00:08:54.060,00:08:58.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,the condition that, this page I think, ph has to be
Dialogue: 0,00:08:58.320,00:09:01.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,greater than this black line.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:02.520,00:09:05.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for example, if we try another,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:05.700,00:09:13.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,if we try like your proposal what's your name again if I try Mike's proposal
Dialogue: 0,00:09:13.620,00:09:22.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,which violates the second condition that is that is instead of setting fee to
Dialogue: 0,00:09:22.980,00:09:28.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,this we set fee of everything is equal to one except for in the region of our
Dialogue: 0,00:09:28.080,00:09:33.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,less than zero right basically we are violating I think we are violating the
Dialogue: 0,00:09:33.980,00:09:40.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,met the monotonicity of total variation condition it's still gonna be second
Dialogue: 0,00:09:40.640,00:09:49.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,order but if we look at the solution here it looks good but like if you see
Dialogue: 0,00:09:49.160,00:09:56.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,MATLAB is a it's a smart thing whenever you have a solution exceed the one and
Dialogue: 0,00:09:56.780,00:10:03.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,minus one it rescales the screen so that like it looks like you have let's let's
Dialogue: 0,00:10:03.740,00:10:03.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,zoom in a little bit and see if we can see the difference between the two so
Dialogue: 0,00:10:03.960,00:10:04.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's a smart thing whenever you have a solution exceed the one and minus one it
Dialogue: 0,00:10:04.460,00:10:12.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,actually see this so you see that the solution has peaks now that exceeds the
Dialogue: 0,00:10:12.760,00:10:17.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,the value one so it is not monotonically decreasing the total
Dialogue: 0,00:10:17.580,00:10:24.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,variation all right but the solution is still second-order accurate so so the
Dialogue: 0,00:10:24.420,00:10:31.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,proposal is not too bad and over over this region it actually damps down the
Dialogue: 0,00:10:31.080,00:10:33.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,shockwave and doesn't it doesn't create wild or
Dialogue: 0,00:10:33.960,00:10:49.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,the
Dialogue: 0,00:10:49.800,00:10:55.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,everywhere because it's actually using information from the wrong side okay so
Dialogue: 0,00:10:55.580,00:11:03.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,so this lecture we discussed how to solve scalar conservation loss in one
Dialogue: 0,00:11:03.720,00:11:03.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,way or another so we're going to go through the whole thing and we're going to
Dialogue: 0,00:11:03.800,00:11:03.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,go through the whole thing and we're going to go through the whole thing and
Dialogue: 0,00:11:03.920,00:11:09.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,one dimension but now we have going to second order schemes okay so this
Dialogue: 0,00:11:09.680,00:11:09.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,one dimension but now we have going to second order schemes okay so this
Dialogue: 0,00:11:09.700,00:11:14.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,finishes our discussion on solving scalar conservation loss on one
