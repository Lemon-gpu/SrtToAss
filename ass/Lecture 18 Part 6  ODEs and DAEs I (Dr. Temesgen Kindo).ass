Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:07.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Questions about entering PDEs? Is it clear so far? Yes.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:07.000,00:00:17.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you wanted an equation with like a fourth order derivative, the weak-sorm level wave option you have is the couple of high order derivatives?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:17.000,00:00:21.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I will let you think about it. How can you do it?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:21.000,00:00:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's say you have, how do you solve for example if you have a high order differential equation, say in dynamics?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:30.000,00:00:35.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean you could reduce it down to the system with lower order equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:35.000,00:00:41.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, so before you enter it you have to reduce it to SSL.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:41.000,00:00:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, that was a good question.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:44.000,00:00:51.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for some of these equations where we know people will have higher order equations,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:51.000,00:00:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,in our own we have pre-implemented this.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:54.000,00:00:59.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,For example in structural mechanics for membranes, you have like the biharmonic equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:59.000,00:01:03.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And there we have already taken care of this.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:03.000,00:01:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,But the only thing you have to be careful when you are specifying this is the discretization you are using.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:16.000,00:01:21.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because let's say you have a fourth order derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:21.000,00:01:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's talk about the second order equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:24.000,00:01:33.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you have a second order equation that let's say in space you have
Dialogue: 0,00:01:33.000,00:01:43.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,in 1D, say d squared u over dx squared, but you decided to introduce an auxiliary variable w,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:43.000,00:01:49.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,such that w is equal to du over dx.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:49.000,00:01:51.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then in your equation instead of this,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:51.000,00:01:57.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,you are going to write dw over dx is going to be whatever originally you had.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:57.000,00:02:05.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then you are going to have du over dx is equal to, this is actually not anything.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:05.000,00:02:07.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is u itself.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:07.000,00:02:15.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now the question is if you went with this and if you picked a certain interpolation function,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:15.000,00:02:19.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,for the finite element method you are picking lower order polynomials,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:19.000,00:02:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,which locally is lower order polynomials and continuously stitched together to get your global solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:26.000,00:02:33.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you picked a second order polynomial for u,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:33.000,00:02:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,then w is going to be a first order polynomial.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:38.000,00:02:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or if u was twice differentiable, you are only going to expect one time differentiability on this.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:46.000,00:02:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,But then when you did this,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:48.000,00:02:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,then you could inadvertently make w and u to be of the same order.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:54.000,00:02:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,But in general they are not.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:56.000,00:03:01.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that choice of how you pick the order of interpolation,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:01.000,00:03:05.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,especially for mixed problems,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:05.000,00:03:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,is an important topic in finite element analysis.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:10.000,00:03:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Beautiful.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:14.000,00:03:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Thank you.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:16.000,00:03:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Did you guys discuss inf subconditions or something like that in finite element analysis?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:24.000,00:03:29.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,There are basically existence, uniqueness, stability issues that you might run into numerically
Dialogue: 0,00:03:29.000,00:03:31.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,when you use a mixed problem.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:31.000,00:03:33.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you are right in terms of splitting,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:33.000,00:03:37.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,but make sure that you are using the right approximation spaces
Dialogue: 0,00:03:37.000,00:03:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,for the new auxiliary variable you introduced.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:43.000,00:03:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:44.000,00:03:45.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Can you break your...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:46.000,00:03:57.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Can you do that with user defined function?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:57.000,00:03:58.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:58.000,00:03:59.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then when you do that,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:59.000,00:04:03.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,because in the user defined function you define what you are doing,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:03.000,00:04:07.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,how do you call the value from the previous ?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:07.000,00:04:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:08.000,00:04:13.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is when you have a one-way coupled problem, is it?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:13.000,00:04:15.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or if I write it in the space,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:15.000,00:04:17.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and see if I can do the equation for it.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:17.000,00:04:27.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you are saying maybe you have a problem,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:27.000,00:04:35.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,c1 u, let me ignore other terms,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:35.000,00:04:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,is equal to some function f,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:38.000,00:04:43.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,but then I have, I am solving for another equation, let's say,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:43.000,00:04:57.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,e, w over e plus e to the minus e to w is equal to some function of u.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:57.000,00:05:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So these equations are coupled,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:00.000,00:05:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,but they are only one-way coupled, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:02.000,00:05:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,In that in here you don't have any term containing w,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:08.000,00:05:11.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,but in here you have a term containing u.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:11.000,00:05:12.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you could...
Dialogue: 0,00:05:13.000,00:05:17.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,First solve just this one of them,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:17.000,00:05:21.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,then next time when you are solving this,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:21.000,00:05:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,you want to say I want to use the solution for u in this equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:25.000,00:05:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is that what you want to do?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:26.000,00:05:27.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:27.000,00:05:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:28.000,00:05:33.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if that is what you want to do,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:33.000,00:05:39.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,say in here the first thing is you can add a new equation,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:39.000,00:05:41.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,like a new physics,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:41.000,00:05:45.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so I can come to physics and then I can say add physics,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:45.000,00:05:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,do the same thing of going to mathematics,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:48.000,00:05:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,pd, let's say coefficient form,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:50.000,00:05:55.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,this time it's c, I will add that.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:55.000,00:05:57.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now here it gives the name c2,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:57.000,00:05:59.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,you can change the name.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:59.000,00:06:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's say the other one is already,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:02.000,00:06:05.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,instead of c let me actually rename it.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:05.000,00:06:07.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, that's u.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:07.000,00:06:09.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And here I want to name this w, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:09.000,00:06:13.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The dependent variable is w.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:13.000,00:06:17.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now if you come to here in the equation,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:17.000,00:06:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,now you have a template in terms of w, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:20.000,00:06:23.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now if you want to enter,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:23.000,00:06:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,you have already entered this equation,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:25.000,00:06:27.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,you want to enter this.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:27.000,00:06:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,In that template, da is going to be 0,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:30.000,00:06:35.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,da is going to be 1, right, for the w equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:35.000,00:06:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,c is going to be some value.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:38.000,00:06:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The only thing is I'm going to have this source term,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:42.000,00:06:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,which should contain u, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:44.000,00:06:49.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And in that, come to the source term here,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:49.000,00:06:51.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,let's say it was u squared, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:51.000,00:06:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then just type u squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:54.000,00:06:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that's it.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:56.000,00:07:01.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in console actually this is the way to make your own physics coupling.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:01.000,00:07:03.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,If two physics are coupled,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:03.000,00:07:05.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the only thing you have to know is
Dialogue: 0,00:07:05.000,00:07:07.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,which term is going to contain
Dialogue: 0,00:07:07.000,00:07:09.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,something in terms of the other,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:09.000,00:07:11.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and just type that in.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:11.000,00:07:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And now the catch is,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:16.000,00:07:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,here in the solver,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:18.000,00:07:21.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's going to want to solve both of them together.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:21.000,00:07:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that is, we do this for the sake of robustness.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:24.000,00:07:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because possibly there is a two-way coupling,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:28.000,00:07:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and you need to solve it together.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:30.000,00:07:33.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,But now you, as an analyst,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:33.000,00:07:37.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,know from your equations that there is only a one-way coupling.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:37.000,00:07:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then that one-way coupling, you can enforce it.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:40.000,00:07:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the way to enforce it is,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:42.000,00:07:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,here in the study,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:44.000,00:07:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,in the step, add a new study.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:46.000,00:07:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's say I add a new step.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:48.000,00:07:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now I have two steps.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:50.000,00:07:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,But then in the first step,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:52.000,00:07:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I just need to solve for that one.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:54.000,00:07:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And in the second one,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:56.000,00:07:58.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I need to keep only that one.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:58.000,00:08:01.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now what it will do is it will solve the first physics.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:01.000,00:08:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then there is a trickle-down mechanism.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:04.000,00:08:07.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you have to order these choices.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:07.000,00:08:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then you have to do it appropriately
Dialogue: 0,00:08:10.000,00:08:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so that the first one doesn't need data from any other equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:14.000,00:08:17.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then in the second one, you can just use it.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:17.000,00:08:21.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the principle is that it comes from any place
Dialogue: 0,00:08:21.000,00:08:23.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,where you could have typed a number,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:23.000,00:08:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,you could type a function,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:25.000,00:08:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,you could type an expression of another null.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:28.000,00:08:31.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that is how you actually make custom coupling.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:31.000,00:08:33.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Does that address your question?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:33.000,00:08:35.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Other questions?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:35.000,00:08:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:36.000,00:08:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,You don't have to make sure that for that second study
Dialogue: 0,00:08:42.000,00:08:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,that it's dependent on the first study.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:44.000,00:08:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It will just already know that.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:46.000,00:08:47.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:47.000,00:08:51.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,But sometimes that may not be the case.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:51.000,00:08:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,In this case, if you put them under the same study,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:54.000,00:08:58.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,it will just know that to get them from above.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:58.000,00:09:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,But sometimes,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:00.000,00:09:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,but then if I'm solving this,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:02.000,00:09:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm solving both of them together.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:04.000,00:09:05.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:05.000,00:09:07.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So sometimes you might be in a situation where
Dialogue: 0,00:09:07.000,00:09:09.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,you solved the first problem,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:09.000,00:09:11.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and you know you're not going to change it.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:11.000,00:09:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And you just now want to quit your second equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:14.000,00:09:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you don't want to be solving both of them together in two sets,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:18.000,00:09:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,because the first one is dead.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:20.000,00:09:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,You don't want to deal with it, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:22.000,00:09:23.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,In a situation like that,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:23.000,00:09:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,instead of adding a new step,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:26.000,00:09:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,let me delete this,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:28.000,00:09:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,add a completely new study.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:30.000,00:09:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And let me add a new study.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:32.000,00:09:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Add study stationary.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:35.000,00:09:37.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,See the difference?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:37.000,00:09:39.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Earlier I had two steps within the same study.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:39.000,00:09:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,But now I have completely different studies.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:42.000,00:09:43.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Here it doesn't know.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:43.000,00:09:45.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It doesn't know where to get it from.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:45.000,00:09:47.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now in that case,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:47.000,00:09:49.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,let's say I only keep this.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:49.000,00:09:51.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,You see these values of dependent variables?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:51.000,00:09:53.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,If I expand that section,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:53.000,00:09:55.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,there is values of dependent variables solved for,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:55.000,00:09:58.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and values of dependent variables not solved for.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:58.000,00:10:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now at this point,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:00.000,00:10:03.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the solution from above is something I'm not solving for anymore.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:03.000,00:10:05.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I will just be using it as a parameter.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:05.000,00:10:09.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So here you come and say you are user controlled.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:09.000,00:10:13.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,You're getting it from a solution from the first solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:13.000,00:10:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now you are indicating yourself.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:16.000,00:10:19.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is that the answer?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:19.000,00:10:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Other questions?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:22.000,00:10:29.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now let's move on to the other topics.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:29.000,00:10:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ordinary differential equations and differential algebraic equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:34.000,00:10:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,ComSol doesn't make a distinction between ordinary differential equations and differential algebraic equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:40.000,00:10:43.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It doesn't see any derivative in any of the equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:43.000,00:10:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It just deals with it as an algebraic equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:46.000,00:10:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And it's a derivative that deals with it as a differential equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:50.000,00:10:53.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, when we mean what it is,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:53.000,00:10:58.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I want to make it really clear that we actually just mean initial value problems.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:58.000,00:11:01.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you compare those two equations,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:01.000,00:11:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,they are really the same, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:02.000,00:11:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The first one is in time.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:04.000,00:11:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The second one is in space.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:06.000,00:11:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Strictly speaking, mathematically, right,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:08.000,00:11:11.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,they are both ordinary differential equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:11.000,00:11:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,But in numerical analysis, they are treated differently, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:16.000,00:11:19.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,For example, if you were using the finite element method,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:19.000,00:11:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the special derivatives, you're going to,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:22.000,00:11:27.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the special one, you're going to take care of it by the finite element shape function.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:27.000,00:11:29.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Whereas for the time derivative,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:29.000,00:11:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,you're going to have a time integration scheme,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:32.000,00:11:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,something like a backward Euler,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:34.000,00:11:37.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,a time order version of that.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:37.000,00:11:41.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So space and time are dealt with differently.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:41.000,00:11:43.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And because of that,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:43.000,00:11:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,when we mean initial value problems,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:46.000,00:11:47.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,or when we mean all E's,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:47.000,00:11:49.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we just mean initial value problems,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:49.000,00:11:51.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,where there is no special derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:51.000,00:11:53.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,If there is any special derivative,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:53.000,00:11:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,even if you don't have time derivatives,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:56.000,00:12:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,you have to use the PDE integration.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:00.000,00:12:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is that distinction clear?
Dialogue: 0,00:12:02.000,00:12:03.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you also need,
Dialogue: 0,00:12:03.000,00:12:05.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,for example, if you're solving the first equation,
Dialogue: 0,00:12:05.000,00:12:09.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the first equation is mostly like a particle dynamics equation,
Dialogue: 0,00:12:09.000,00:12:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,where you would want to specify both the initial location and the initial velocity.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:14.000,00:12:19.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Whereas the second one is more or less like an equilibrium problem in 1D,
Dialogue: 0,00:12:19.000,00:12:23.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,where you want to specify boundary conditions at the two ends.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:23.000,00:12:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that is like a two point boundary value problem,
Dialogue: 0,00:12:26.000,00:12:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,whereas the other one is an initial value problem
Dialogue: 0,00:12:28.000,00:12:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,where you specify two initial conditions at one point.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:32.000,00:12:35.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So they are different.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:35.000,00:12:37.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So when we mean all E's,
Dialogue: 0,00:12:37.000,00:12:39.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,in the context of console,
Dialogue: 0,00:12:39.000,00:12:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we mean initial value problems.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:42.000,00:12:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So between initial value problems and algebraic problems,
Dialogue: 0,00:12:46.000,00:12:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,there is no distinction.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:48.000,00:12:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,You can also have differential algebraic equations, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:12:50.000,00:12:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,You can have ordinary differential equations
Dialogue: 0,00:12:52.000,00:12:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,between which there is an algebraic constraint.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:56.000,00:13:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this can be global or lumped.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:00.000,00:13:01.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,What I mean by global is,
Dialogue: 0,00:13:01.000,00:13:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,you have just one equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:04.000,00:13:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Whereas, I mean global or domain or distributed.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:08.000,00:13:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,What I mean by domain is,
Dialogue: 0,00:13:10.000,00:13:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,when you can have equations,
Dialogue: 0,00:13:14.000,00:13:17.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,different ODE's every different place.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:17.000,00:13:21.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,That will become clearer when I get to an example.
