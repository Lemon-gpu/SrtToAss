Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:11.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have a function of u, u of x and t at a particular t as a function of x.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:11.500,00:00:20.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,We are going to discretize the domain into x0, x1, etc. to xn.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:22.060,00:00:27.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,So these are a bunch of grid points monotonically increasing.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:27.700,00:00:42.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,What I'm going to do is I'm going to only remember ui, which is defined as u at a particular xi.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:42.040,00:00:47.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,And ui is a function of t only, and u is a function of x and t.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:50.480,00:00:57.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now we can see that the time derivative of ui is what?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:57.700,00:01:05.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well, because ui is just a function of t, I should write it as dui dt.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:08.000,00:01:13.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's equal to partial u of xi t partial t.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:17.420,00:01:27.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right, so if we can derive dui dt as an algebraic function of ui and probably other ui functions,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:27.700,00:01:28.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,we get a system of uis.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:28.860,00:01:29.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,We get an ode.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:30.680,00:01:32.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,We get a system of odes.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:33.220,00:01:35.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,A coupled system of odes.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:35.720,00:01:36.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that we can solve.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:38.120,00:01:41.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so let's continue the derivation.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:41.680,00:01:50.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,By the pde, this is equal to kappa times the second order derivative of u at this xi and t.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:51.980,00:01:54.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the question is, now what?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:54.480,00:01:57.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,How do we approximate this?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:57.700,00:02:01.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,How do we write this as a function of ui?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:01.700,00:02:06.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Probably ui minus 1, ui plus 1, and et cetera.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:06.260,00:02:11.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right, how do we write this as a function of these u's?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:11.420,00:02:20.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,So here, the second order derivative has a very nice approximation.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:20.620,00:02:25.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is because a second order derivative is the first order derivative of the function
Dialogue: 0,00:02:25.980,00:02:26.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,of ui.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:26.980,00:02:30.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have the derivative of the first order derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:30.460,00:02:36.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the first order derivative on this function is the slope.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:36.740,00:02:45.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if we discretize this solution on these grid points, remember these circles we saw
Dialogue: 0,00:02:45.620,00:02:47.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,on the computer?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:47.280,00:02:51.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,We have the slopes.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:51.200,00:02:56.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,We don't have the slope on the grid points, but we have the average slope in between the
Dialogue: 0,00:02:56.260,00:02:56.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,grid points.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:56.980,00:02:57.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:57.980,00:03:11.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,We basically, we can link any of these two circles, and we get the average slope.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:11.160,00:03:15.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,And now, this average slope approximates the first order derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:15.560,00:03:21.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,So taking the difference between the nearest average slopes, we can hope to approximate
Dialogue: 0,00:03:21.980,00:03:23.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,the second order derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:23.980,00:03:24.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, we can do this.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:24.980,00:03:25.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,We can do this.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:25.980,00:03:26.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,We can do this.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:26.980,00:03:29.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's write down the approximation.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:29.880,00:03:37.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the approximation can be written as the difference between the nearest slopes divided
Dialogue: 0,00:03:37.200,00:03:43.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,by the difference between the location of these nearest slopes.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:43.220,00:03:51.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the nearest slope can be written as ui plus 1 minus ui divided by delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:51.660,00:03:54.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,So delta x is the spacing between all the uniform slopes.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:54.980,00:03:55.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,So delta x is the spacing between all the uniform slopes.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:55.980,00:03:56.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the nearest slope can be written as ui plus 1 minus ui into the point delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:56.980,00:03:57.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then delta x is the spacing between all the uniform grid points.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:57.980,00:03:58.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,The uniform.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:58.260,00:04:08.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,In the simplest case for finite difference, we use the uniform grid points.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:08.820,00:04:10.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is the slope.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:10.360,00:04:15.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's say this is the ith grid point.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:15.020,00:04:23.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is the i plus one, and this is the i minus one grid point.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:23.360,00:04:24.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,And now what we have written down is, we have the slope.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:24.880,00:04:24.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,The slope is now 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:24.980,00:04:25.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we introduced the slope.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:25.340,00:04:25.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,We have the slope.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:25.380,00:04:25.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,We have the slope.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:25.680,00:04:25.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,We have the slope.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:25.780,00:04:25.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,And now, this is the slope.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:25.880,00:04:25.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,And now, we have the slope.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:25.980,00:04:35.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,this slope and we also need to minus ui minus ui minus 1 divided by delta x. So
Dialogue: 0,00:04:35.340,00:04:43.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,that's that slope. We divide that by the spacing between these two slopes which
Dialogue: 0,00:04:43.660,00:04:52.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,is again delta x and we collect the terms. What we get is ui plus 1 plus ui
Dialogue: 0,00:04:52.980,00:05:02.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,minus 1 minus 2 times ui divided by delta x squared. That is a standard way
Dialogue: 0,00:05:02.360,00:05:09.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,to approximate the second order derivative using finite difference. Now
Dialogue: 0,00:05:09.940,00:05:17.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,with that approximation we get this being left hand side and this being
Dialogue: 0,00:05:17.640,00:05:22.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,right hand side. That's an ODE we can solve.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:22.980,00:05:36.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,We get dui dt equal to kappa times ui plus 1 plus ui minus 1 minus 2 ui
Dialogue: 0,00:05:36.400,00:05:43.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,divided by delta x. And that is true for
Dialogue: 0,00:05:52.980,00:06:04.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,i equal to 1 2 3 2n minus 1. And on the two sides we have boundary conditions
Dialogue: 0,00:06:04.980,00:06:10.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,which we will talk later. The simplest type of boundary condition is u0 which
Dialogue: 0,00:06:10.720,00:06:15.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,is u at the left hand side of the domain has to equal to a specific value at the
Dialogue: 0,00:06:15.480,00:06:20.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,left and un which is the value at the right end of the domain is equal to a
Dialogue: 0,00:06:20.940,00:06:22.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,different specific number.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:22.980,00:06:25.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Thank you.
