Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:11.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'll give you an example. So let me say if I discretize the time derivative using forward order
Dialogue: 0,00:00:11.000,00:00:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I assume everybody at least know what forward order is. So it basically takes two time steps.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:18.000,00:00:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So k plus 1 and k are two consecutive time steps. One is at t, one is at t plus delta t.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:25.000,00:00:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is approximation to dEI dt at t equal to tk.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:34.000,00:00:41.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,This, let's write down the numerical solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:41.000,00:00:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,ek of i plus 1 plus ek of i minus 1 minus 2 ek i plus tau i.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:54.000,00:00:55.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,OK.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:55.000,00:01:05.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you look at this equation, there is a condition for which the solution would not self-amplify.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:05.000,00:01:17.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The condition is delta t has to be less than delta x squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:17.000,00:01:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Do I need over 2? No, I don't need over 2. So delta t has to be less than delta x squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:24.000,00:01:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,OK.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:25.000,00:01:27.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:27.000,00:01:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because otherwise, because otherwise I'm going to derive a matrix equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:34.000,00:01:43.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm going to say e to the k plus 1. I'm going to define it as ek plus 1 1, ek plus 1 2, etc.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:43.000,00:01:47.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,ek plus 1 n, let's say minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:47.000,00:01:53.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is going to be a matrix times e to the k.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:53.000,00:01:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,e to the k is the same vector.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:54.000,00:02:03.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,e to the k is the same vector at k plus this vector tau, which is also tau 1, etc.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:03.000,00:02:11.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,tau i, tau n minus 1, also at time step k.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:11.000,00:02:23.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you look at the matrix, what the matrix is, OK, you probably need to rearrange the terms in this equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:23.000,00:02:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is this is multiplied by delta t.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:26.000,00:02:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what you need to do is you need to write down ek plus 1 is equal to eik plus delta t over delta x squared times minus 2 eik plus ei plus 1 k plus ei minus 1 k plus delta t tau ik.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:48.000,00:02:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the matrix is going to look like very similar.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:52.000,00:03:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,To the kind of matrix we derived in the last class, but a little bit different because I have this term and I have a delta t term.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:00.000,00:03:09.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the diagonals, for example, is going to be 1 minus 2 delta t over delta x squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:09.000,00:03:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:10.000,00:03:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The off-diagonals is just going to be delta t over delta x squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:14.000,00:03:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the same and the lower diagonal is also the same.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:22.000,00:03:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,You can take a look at this matrix and you can particularly look at what's called the norm of this matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:30.000,00:03:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,OK, so let's say this matrix is A.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:36.000,00:03:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The norm of the matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:40.000,00:03:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The norm of this matrix defines the norm of the matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:50.000,00:04:03.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Defines the maximum possible ratio of A times E divided by E.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:03.000,00:04:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,OK.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:04.000,00:04:11.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And here both the numerator and denominator are the norm of a vector.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:11.000,00:04:17.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, for example, norm of the vector E.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:17.000,00:04:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So E is a vector.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:18.000,00:04:19.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,OK.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:20.000,00:04:27.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And here the numerator is defined as the length of the vector.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:27.000,00:04:33.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So EI 1 squared plus E2 squared plus etc plus EI minus 1 squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:33.000,00:04:35.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:35.000,00:04:37.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,By the way, there are many different norms.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:37.000,00:04:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is one of the most commonly seen norm.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:40.000,00:04:45.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's usually called the 2 norm because of the squares are power of 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:45.000,00:04:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if I'm using 2 norms for the vectors,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:48.000,00:04:51.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the matrix norm is also called the 2 norm.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:51.000,00:04:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The matrix norm is inherited from the vector norm.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:56.000,00:04:57.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,OK.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:57.000,00:05:05.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now if the norm of the matrix is less than 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:05.000,00:05:13.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm fine because E is equal to A times E plus a truncation error.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:13.000,00:05:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,If the truncation error is small,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:16.000,00:05:21.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,then the E would be the same order of magnitude as the truncation error.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:21.000,00:05:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It would not self-amplify.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:24.000,00:05:27.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,If the norm of the matrix is greater than 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:27.000,00:05:29.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,no good.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:29.000,00:05:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Even if I have a small delta t,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:32.000,00:05:35.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,even if I have a small tau,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:35.000,00:05:41.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,my E is going to amplify to infinity.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:41.000,00:05:45.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,OK.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:45.000,00:05:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the norm of a matrix in MATLAB,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:52.000,00:05:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,you can just type norm.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:54.000,00:05:55.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:55.000,00:06:03.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's a good way to look at the norm in a matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:03.000,00:06:05.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,MATLAB.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:05.000,00:06:09.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is it for any vector E?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:09.000,00:06:12.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the definition of the norm is for any vector E.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:12.000,00:06:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the maximization is for any vector E.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:14.000,00:06:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the maximization is for any E not equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:18.000,00:06:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,You are right.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:20.000,00:06:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the maximization is over all possible E's.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:25.000,00:06:27.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we are going to,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:27.000,00:06:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,for some of you this may be the first time we introduce norms.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:30.000,00:06:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if you studied linear algebra,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:32.000,00:06:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,you probably also have encountered norms before.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:36.000,00:06:41.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,But like in MATLAB,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:41.000,00:06:43.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,whenever we have a matrix,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:43.000,00:06:47.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,let's say if our identity matrix,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:47.000,00:06:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the norm of a is going to be what?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:52.000,00:06:55.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if a is an identity matrix,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:55.000,00:07:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,what is the maximum possible ratio of aE over E?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:00.000,00:07:01.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,1.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:01.000,00:07:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,1, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:02.000,00:07:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because aE is going to be equal to E.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:04.000,00:07:07.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So norm of a is going to be 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:07.000,00:07:09.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:09.000,00:07:12.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,If a is equal to 2 times identity,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:12.000,00:07:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,what is the norm of a?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:14.000,00:07:15.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,2.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:15.000,00:07:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's 2, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:16.000,00:07:19.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because this is going to be 2E over E.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:19.000,00:07:21.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's going to be?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:21.000,00:07:23.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,You need to learn it.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:23.000,00:07:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Huh?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:24.000,00:07:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:25.000,00:07:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Absolutely.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:26.000,00:07:27.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:27.000,00:07:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:28.000,00:07:29.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I have a norm equal to 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:29.000,00:07:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, thank you.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:30.000,00:07:31.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I was freaking out.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:31.000,00:07:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:32.000,00:07:33.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:33.000,00:07:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:34.000,00:07:35.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:35.000,00:07:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:36.000,00:07:37.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:37.000,00:07:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:38.000,00:07:39.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:39.000,00:07:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:40.000,00:07:41.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:41.000,00:07:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is going to be.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:44.000,00:07:45.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:45.000,00:07:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:46.000,00:07:47.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:47.000,00:07:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:48.000,00:07:49.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,To get e here,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:49.000,00:07:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,like,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:50.000,00:07:51.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,do we need to know ua first?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:51.000,00:07:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I think the derivation assumes that we,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:52.000,00:07:53.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,like,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:53.000,00:07:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,already know u sub a for us to be able to
Dialogue: 0,00:07:54.000,00:07:55.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,find the matrix for E.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:55.000,00:07:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is that right,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:56.000,00:07:57.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,or,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:57.000,00:07:58.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:58.000,00:07:59.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,if we ...
Dialogue: 0,00:07:59.000,00:08:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So is...
Dialogue: 0,00:08:00.000,00:08:01.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Go back one slide.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:01.000,00:08:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Go back one slide.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:02.000,00:08:03.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:03.000,00:08:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So to find the equation for E,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:04.000,00:08:05.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we assume that we know u sub a,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:05.000,00:08:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,i,

Dialogue: 0,00:08:12.720,00:08:14.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,But in most cases, we don't know what's,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:14.760,00:08:16.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,we want to solve for u sub a.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:17.060,00:08:19.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,You're right, we don't know what u sub a is.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:19.500,00:08:20.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's an analytical solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:20.800,00:08:22.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,Most cases, we don't have it.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:23.060,00:08:25.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,And luckily, in this error equation,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:26.520,00:08:29.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,although u sub a appears in the beginning,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:29.660,00:08:32.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,so in the green part, you see u sub a appears, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:33.400,00:08:35.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,But once we get to the red equation,

Dialogue: 0,00:08:49.960,00:08:53.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,So only the source term, only the tau,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:53.880,00:08:56.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,has analytical solution in it.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:57.660,00:09:00.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,And although we don't know what tau is,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:00.240,00:09:02.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,because the exact value of tau depends on analytical solution,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:03.580,00:09:07.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,we did tailor series analysis to know how fast
Dialogue: 0,00:09:07.660,00:09:09.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,does tau go to zero, as I refined that.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:10.000,00:09:13.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we can say that the error equation is equal to delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:13.000,00:09:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that is the good thing about the error equation,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:16.000,00:09:19.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,is that we don't know what tau is,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:19.000,00:09:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,but we know the order of magnitude of tau
Dialogue: 0,00:09:22.000,00:09:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,through tailor series analysis.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:25.000,00:09:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And all the other terms does not depend on
Dialogue: 0,00:09:28.000,00:09:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the analytical solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:30.000,00:09:31.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:31.000,00:09:33.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any other questions?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:33.000,00:09:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:36.000,00:09:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you have a stable name matrix,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:38.000,00:09:39.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,because I'm like, like, client-like,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:39.000,00:09:39.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm not going to be able to do that.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:39.720,00:09:39.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:39.920,00:09:41.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,There is a steady state solution for E.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:41.920,00:09:47.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,If I have a, if we have a stable A,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:47.920,00:09:52.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,can I make the claim that I have a steady state solution for E?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:52.920,00:09:53.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:53.920,00:09:59.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,This, the answer is yes if tau i does not depend on time.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:59.920,00:10:01.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:01.920,00:10:06.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, so tau remember is the difference between the operator,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:06.920,00:10:09.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,the discrete operator and the continuous operator,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:09.640,00:10:11.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,operated on the analytical solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:11.640,00:10:14.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if the analytical solution reaches a steady state,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:14.640,00:10:17.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,then yes.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:17.640,00:10:20.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,If the analytical solution doesn't reach a steady state,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:20.640,00:10:23.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,for example, in the project when you are controlling the U
Dialogue: 0,00:10:23.640,00:10:26.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,and you make U sometimes bigger, sometimes smaller,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:26.640,00:10:30.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,then the analytical solution does not reach a steady state.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:30.640,00:10:33.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,And your E also would not reach a steady state.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:33.640,00:10:38.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,But you can bound this magnitude if you can bound the magnitude of tau.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:39.640,00:10:49.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:49.640,00:10:50.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:50.640,00:10:56.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, so the norm of A is going to be something that,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:56.640,00:11:00.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,that you can use to analyze stability of the solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:00.640,00:11:07.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this particular matrix, for example, we can,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:07.640,00:11:08.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,we can call this,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:08.640,00:11:12.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,dT dx2.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:12.640,00:11:18.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's call this as dT over dx square.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:18.640,00:11:24.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,If this is equal to 0.5, okay, we are going to be making a matrix A
Dialogue: 0,00:11:24.640,00:11:29.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,that is equal to 1 minus 2 times dT over dx square in the diagonal.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:29.640,00:11:36.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is 1 minus 2 times dT dx square times identity of,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:36.640,00:11:37.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,let's say, 100.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:37.640,00:11:38.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:38.640,00:11:39.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:39.640,00:11:41.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,A is that thing.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:41.640,00:11:46.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, it's actually, this is actually 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:46.640,00:11:49.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,And for I goes from 1 to 99,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:49.640,00:11:54.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,we are going to say A of I, I plus 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:54.640,00:11:57.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,is equal to dT dx square.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:57.640,00:12:03.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,A of I, I plus 1 and I is also equal to dT dx square.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:03.640,00:12:06.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So A is this matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:06.640,00:12:07.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you type norm of A,
Dialogue: 0,00:12:07.640,00:12:11.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,you get something smaller than 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:11.640,00:12:16.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,But if dT dx square is equal to, let's say, 1.5,
Dialogue: 0,00:12:16.640,00:12:18.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,you are out of luck.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:18.640,00:12:26.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because you take A equal to this and you do the same thing.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:26.640,00:12:30.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Norm of A is going to be 4.99.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:30.640,00:12:32.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,And you are going to get,
Dialogue: 0,00:12:32.640,00:12:35.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,so every time E is amplified by a factor of almost 5,
Dialogue: 0,00:12:35.640,00:12:36.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,you are going to get infinity.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:36.640,00:12:41.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,You are going to get infinity after a pretty finite number of time steps.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:41.640,00:12:42.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:12:42.640,00:12:45.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Did you say the condition for stability was A less than 1?
Dialogue: 0,00:12:45.640,00:12:46.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:46.640,00:12:48.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm sorry, norm of A is less than 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:48.640,00:12:50.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:50.640,00:12:54.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Norm of A has to be less than 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:54.640,00:12:55.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:55.640,00:12:59.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any other questions?
Dialogue: 0,00:12:59.640,00:13:00.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:00.640,00:13:04.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So why is the norm larger than 1 still being unstable?
Dialogue: 0,00:13:04.640,00:13:06.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Why is it going to be unstable?
Dialogue: 0,00:13:06.640,00:13:10.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because if the norm is greater than 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:13:10.640,00:13:12.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,that's actually a good question.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:12.640,00:13:14.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,I forgot to mention that.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:14.640,00:13:16.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,If the norm is larger than 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:13:16.640,00:13:20.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,that means there exists an E.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:20.640,00:13:24.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,That makes A times E to be larger than E.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:24.640,00:13:28.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:13:28.640,00:13:30.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,And no matter,
Dialogue: 0,00:13:30.640,00:13:33.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,so if you look at the solution,
Dialogue: 0,00:13:33.640,00:13:34.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,the truncation error tau,
Dialogue: 0,00:13:34.640,00:13:39.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,tau may have maybe a linear combination of many components.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:39.640,00:13:45.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,But only if there is one component that lies along that solution,
Dialogue: 0,00:13:45.640,00:13:51.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,that component is going to be amplified.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:51.640,00:13:53.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,And over many time steps,
Dialogue: 0,00:13:53.640,00:13:55.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,if it keeps being amplified,
Dialogue: 0,00:13:55.640,00:14:00.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,you get an unstable solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:00.640,00:14:03.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we'll discuss more about that later.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:03.640,00:14:08.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the norm of A to be less than 1 is a sufficient,
Dialogue: 0,00:14:08.640,00:14:11.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,but not necessary condition for stability.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:11.640,00:14:12.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:12.640,00:14:16.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,There are actually some cases where the norm of A can be larger than 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:16.640,00:14:18.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,You can still be stable.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:18.640,00:14:20.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,You need an eigenvalue analysis of A
Dialogue: 0,00:14:20.640,00:14:24.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,to figure out exactly if the scheme is going to be stable or not.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:24.640,00:14:29.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,You need the maximum eigenvalue to be actually less than 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:29.640,00:14:30.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in some cases,
Dialogue: 0,00:14:30.640,00:14:32.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,even if your eigenvalues are all less than 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:14:32.640,00:14:34.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,the norm can still be larger than 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:34.640,00:14:36.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,But usually the norm is,
Dialogue: 0,00:14:36.640,00:14:39.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,if you can make sure the norm is less than 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:14:39.640,00:14:42.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,you are sure you get a stable scheme.
