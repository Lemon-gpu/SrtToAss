Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now we have the discrete Fourier series. How do we apply von Neumann stability analysis?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:08.000,00:00:19.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's plug this series into the differential equation and see what happens.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:19.000,00:00:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So again, the exponential term has nothing to do with time derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:25.000,00:00:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The only term that has to do with time derivative is the u hat k term.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:34.000,00:00:41.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have a d u hat k dt times e to the jk i delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:41.000,00:00:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's the left-hand side. And the right-hand side is different from the continuous case.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:50.000,00:00:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,What's amazing, at least to me, is that
Dialogue: 0,00:00:54.000,00:00:55.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,when we plug this in,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:55.000,00:00:58.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we plug the Fourier series into the continuous derivative,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:58.000,00:01:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we get rid of the coupling between different exponentials.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:02.000,00:01:09.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,That actually also happens for discrete differential operators on a uniform grid.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:09.000,00:01:17.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we look at the right-hand side. We have a kappa of something long divided by delta x squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:17.000,00:01:21.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And let's take a look at what this something long is.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:21.000,00:01:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So first of all, all the terms u of i plus 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:24.000,00:01:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,u of i plus 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:25.000,00:01:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,u of i minus 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:26.000,00:01:27.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and u of i,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:27.000,00:01:35.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,they are summation of k over the same space.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:35.000,00:01:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And all of them are u hat of k.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:42.000,00:01:45.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,That we don't have anything to do.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:45.000,00:01:47.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean, they are different only with i.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:47.000,00:01:49.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the parenthesis is the following.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:49.000,00:01:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,e to the jk i plus 1 delta x, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:54.000,00:01:57.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's the u i plus 1 term.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:57.000,00:02:01.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Plus e to the jk of i minus 1 delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:01.000,00:02:03.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's the u i minus 1 term.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:03.000,00:02:11.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Minus e to the jk i delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:11.000,00:02:15.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's the effect of plugging in the discrete Fourier series
Dialogue: 0,00:02:15.000,00:02:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,into the discretized differential equation. Yeah?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:20.000,00:02:23.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ah, we need the two. Thank you.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:23.000,00:02:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have the discrete operator.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:26.000,00:02:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And now the key question is,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:28.000,00:02:31.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,what is this thing in the parenthesis?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:31.000,00:02:33.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:33.000,00:02:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's, on the next page,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:34.000,00:02:37.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,figure out what is this thing on the parenthesis.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:37.000,00:02:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Can I just...
Dialogue: 0,00:02:38.000,00:02:41.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I can still write here, but, uh, anyway.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:44.000,00:02:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the parenthesis is j to the j plus...
Dialogue: 0,00:02:48.000,00:02:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Not j plus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:50.000,00:02:51.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ah...
Dialogue: 0,00:02:51.000,00:02:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,jk i plus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:52.000,00:02:55.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,jk i plus 1 delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:55.000,00:02:59.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Plus e to the jk i minus 1 delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:59.000,00:03:03.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Minus 2 e jk i delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:05.000,00:03:09.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, the first thing to do is to expand this
Dialogue: 0,00:03:09.000,00:03:12.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,as e to the jk i delta x
Dialogue: 0,00:03:12.000,00:03:15.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,plus jk delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:15.000,00:03:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this to e to the jk i delta x
Dialogue: 0,00:03:18.000,00:03:21.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,minus jk delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:21.000,00:03:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:22.000,00:03:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then, the summation...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:24.000,00:03:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the exponential of summations
Dialogue: 0,00:03:26.000,00:03:29.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,is equal to the product of exponentials.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:29.000,00:03:31.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And same thing as here,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:31.000,00:03:33.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,except for there is a minus sign.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:34.000,00:03:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And now we can collect the terms.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:36.000,00:03:39.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,We all have this term, this term, and this term.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:39.000,00:03:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It becomes e to the jk i delta x
Dialogue: 0,00:03:42.000,00:03:45.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,times e to the jk delta x
Dialogue: 0,00:03:45.000,00:03:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,plus e to the minus jk delta x
Dialogue: 0,00:03:48.000,00:03:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,minus 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:51.000,00:03:53.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:53.000,00:03:58.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now, this is something that does not depend on i.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:58.000,00:04:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It only depends on k.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:04.000,00:04:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now we plug this back into the equation we started.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:08.000,00:04:13.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,We have summation of k.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:13.000,00:04:15.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ah...
Dialogue: 0,00:04:15.000,00:04:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,du hat k.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:20.000,00:04:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ah...
Dialogue: 0,00:04:25.000,00:04:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,dt e to the jk i delta x
Dialogue: 0,00:04:32.000,00:04:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,is going to be equal to the same summation
Dialogue: 0,00:04:36.000,00:04:39.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,u hat of k.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:39.000,00:04:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ah...
Dialogue: 0,00:04:40.000,00:04:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, I missed a kappa here.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:42.000,00:04:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,There is a kappa here.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:44.000,00:04:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ah... u hat of k.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:46.000,00:04:49.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,This thing divided by delta x squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:49.000,00:04:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have e to the jk i delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:54.000,00:04:57.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so let me first write...
Dialogue: 0,00:04:57.000,00:05:05.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what we are going to be doing is plug what we derived earlier into the equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:05.000,00:05:15.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right, so this is...
Dialogue: 0,00:05:15.000,00:05:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is the equation we finally got.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:19.000,00:05:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,After manipulating the discrete Fourier series.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:24.000,00:05:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Again, we can match terms.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:28.000,00:05:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,On the left-hand side, we have this.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:32.000,00:05:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,On the right-hand side, we have kappa times u hat of k
Dialogue: 0,00:05:36.000,00:05:39.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,times this thing we just derived.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:39.000,00:05:41.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:41.000,00:05:45.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,What is left is basically summation of the same co...
Dialogue: 0,00:05:45.000,00:05:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the coefficient times e to the jk i delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:48.000,00:05:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's the same here. It's the same here.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:52.000,00:05:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that means
Dialogue: 0,00:05:54.000,00:05:57.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,du hat of k dt
Dialogue: 0,00:05:57.000,00:06:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,would be equal to kappa times u hat of k
Dialogue: 0,00:06:00.000,00:06:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,times...
Dialogue: 0,00:06:02.000,00:06:05.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let me just write u hat of k later.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:05.000,00:06:13.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Times this weird long thing we just derived.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:13.000,00:06:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Times u hat of k.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:16.000,00:06:17.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,But no matter how weird this thing is,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:17.000,00:06:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,it is the time derivative of u hat of k
Dialogue: 0,00:06:22.000,00:06:29.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,equal to something times u hat of k.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:29.000,00:06:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's a differential equation we know the analytical solution of.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:36.000,00:06:37.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:37.000,00:06:45.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's just u hat of k equal to exponential of this whole thing times t.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:45.000,00:06:51.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And what determines the stability of this equation?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:51.000,00:06:57.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes, the real part of this whole thing has to be negative.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:57.000,00:07:01.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,This number, it can be a complex number.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:01.000,00:07:03.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,In this case, it happens to be a real number.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:03.000,00:07:05.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,But if it's a complex number,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:05.000,00:07:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we only need to make sure the real part of this
Dialogue: 0,00:07:08.000,00:07:13.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,or the number is on the left-hand side of the complex plane.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:13.000,00:07:17.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Compare this to the analytical.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:17.000,00:07:21.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the discrete.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:21.000,00:07:23.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And compare to the analytical case.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:23.000,00:07:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's use blue.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:30.000,00:07:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,We have du hat of k dt equal to,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:34.000,00:07:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,in this case, analytically,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:36.000,00:07:39.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we had kappa minus k squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:39.000,00:07:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:40.000,00:07:43.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Kappa minus k squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:43.000,00:07:45.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,u hat of k.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:45.000,00:07:47.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The continuous and discrete case,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:47.000,00:07:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,they look slightly different.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:50.000,00:07:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is the effect of discretization.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:54.000,00:07:57.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:57.000,00:07:59.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And let's figure out what this is.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:59.000,00:08:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:02.000,00:08:05.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so e to the jk delta x
Dialogue: 0,00:08:05.000,00:08:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,is equal to cosine of j,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:08.000,00:08:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,no j,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:10.000,00:08:13.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,cosine of k delta x
Dialogue: 0,00:08:13.000,00:08:19.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,plus i sine of k delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:19.000,00:08:21.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,e to the minus jk delta x
Dialogue: 0,00:08:21.000,00:08:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,is equal to the same cosine,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:24.000,00:08:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,but minus i times sine of k delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:28.000,00:08:33.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And therefore, the summation of them
Dialogue: 0,00:08:33.000,00:08:35.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,turns out to be positive.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:35.000,00:08:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if I minus another 2,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:38.000,00:08:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,this 3, which is here,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:40.000,00:08:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,would be equal to
Dialogue: 0,00:08:42.000,00:08:47.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,2 times cosine k delta x
Dialogue: 0,00:08:47.000,00:08:49.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,minus 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:49.000,00:08:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:50.000,00:08:53.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's what we get.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:53.000,00:08:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:54.000,00:08:57.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if you look at the cosine function,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:57.000,00:09:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and remember, we're also dividing this by delta x squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:00.000,00:09:03.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if you look at the cosine function,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:03.000,00:09:07.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and if you remember the Taylor series expansion
Dialogue: 0,00:09:07.000,00:09:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,of this cosine function at 0,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:10.000,00:09:12.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the first derivative is 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:12.000,00:09:15.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The second derivative is minus half.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:15.000,00:09:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, when k times delta x is small,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:18.000,00:09:21.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,when delta x is small enough compared to k,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:21.000,00:09:23.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,what you get is,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:23.000,00:09:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,this is actually a good approximation of minus k squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:28.000,00:09:31.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:31.000,00:09:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,so 2 times cosine k delta x
Dialogue: 0,00:09:34.000,00:09:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,minus 2 over delta x squared
Dialogue: 0,00:09:36.000,00:09:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,approximates minus k,
