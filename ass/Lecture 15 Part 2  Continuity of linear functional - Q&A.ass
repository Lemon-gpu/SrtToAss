Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:03.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is for linear functionals.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:04.120,00:00:12.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's one of the conditions that we need for the well-posedness of a weak form like that.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:12.960,00:00:16.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,The right-hand side, the linear functional, has to be bounded or continuous.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:17.660,00:00:21.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you don't have a continuous, let's say if you have a right-hand side,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:21.740,00:00:25.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,that is even more non-smooth than the delta function.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:25.520,00:00:30.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then the Poisson's equation doesn't have to have a solution even in the weak sense.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:31.100,00:00:37.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,But in this case, because the delta function is a bounded linear functional for H1,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:37.760,00:00:42.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,and our weak form for Poisson's equation we did last lecture is defining H1,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:42.880,00:00:46.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,therefore we still have a perfectly valid solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:46.360,00:00:51.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we can do error analysis and a bunch of things for finite element
Dialogue: 0,00:00:51.940,00:00:55.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,if we have a Poisson's equation with a delta function being the right-hand side.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:55.520,00:01:04.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is your question if you define L of V as the integral of the function between 0 and 1?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:05.940,00:01:08.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,What do you mean by a step function between 0 and 2?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:11.980,00:01:15.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,And you're saying you're going to replace the delta function with a step function?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:16.260,00:01:16.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is that right?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:18.080,00:01:25.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,So L of V is a function that maps from a linear space, from a functional space.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:25.520,00:01:29.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,To a field, let's say the field of real numbers.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:31.900,00:01:35.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so the result of the L of V has to be a number.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:38.320,00:01:42.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what do you mean by L of V is a step function?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:44.020,00:01:49.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,I can define this, I can replace the delta function by a step function, for example.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:49.320,00:01:51.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,That'll be a perfectly valid linear function though.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:53.020,00:01:53.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is that true?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:55.520,00:01:57.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, exactly.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:57.460,00:01:59.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so we can do the same thing.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:59.940,00:02:03.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,The example we are taking here is L2 and H1.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:04.780,00:02:06.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,The L2 space and H1 space.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:07.280,00:02:10.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,L2 space is all the functions whose square is integrable.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:11.080,00:02:15.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,H1 is all the functions, is the space of all the functions whose square is integrable
Dialogue: 0,00:02:15.360,00:02:19.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,and also have square integrable derivatives.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:19.060,00:02:19.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:21.900,00:02:23.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:24.840,00:02:25.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,Does that answer?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:25.520,00:02:25.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Your question?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:28.880,00:02:29.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:30.040,00:02:32.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean, if you're still confused, keep asking.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:34.760,00:02:35.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:35.760,00:02:36.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any other questions?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:39.540,00:02:40.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:40.500,00:02:43.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is what we have to have for L of V.
