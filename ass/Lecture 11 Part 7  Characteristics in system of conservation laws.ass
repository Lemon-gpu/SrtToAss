Dialogue: 0,00:09:52.880,00:09:57.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to write rho and the two times M

Dialogue: 0,00:10:00.880,00:10:01.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's...

Dialogue: 0,00:10:07.880,00:10:11.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm differentiating this to M,

Dialogue: 0,00:10:27.880,00:10:31.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,The two eigenvalues are U times square root of G H
Dialogue: 0,00:10:31.880,00:10:34.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,and U minus square root of G H.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:39.880,00:10:44.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,U plus minus square root of G H.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:44.880,00:10:45.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:45.880,00:10:47.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that tells us something interesting.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:47.880,00:10:50.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the waves in this shallow world equation,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:50.880,00:10:52.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,they...
Dialogue: 0,00:10:52.880,00:10:56.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Of course, it changes as the local velocity changes.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:56.880,00:11:00.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if U is positive, both waves tends to go towards the right.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:00.880,00:11:03.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,If U is negative, both waves tends to go towards the left.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:03.880,00:11:06.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,But then, there are two waves.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:06.880,00:11:11.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is U and this is rho plus G H
Dialogue: 0,00:11:11.880,00:11:16.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,and this is U minus G H.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:16.880,00:11:18.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,And depending on the rho, the rho is equal to...
Dialogue: 0,00:11:18.880,00:11:23.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,And depending on the ratio of U to square root of G H,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:23.880,00:11:28.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,the flow can be either subsonic or supersonic.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:28.880,00:11:32.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,In the sense that if U is greater than square root of G H,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:32.880,00:11:35.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,if the magnitude of U is greater than square root of G H,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:35.880,00:11:39.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,then both characteristics propagate towards the same direction.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:39.880,00:11:41.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you put a perturbation somewhere,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:41.880,00:11:42.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,the flow wouldn't...
Dialogue: 0,00:11:42.880,00:11:45.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,The perturbation would only propagate in one direction
Dialogue: 0,00:11:45.880,00:11:47.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,without going towards the other direction.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:47.880,00:11:50.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,If U has a magnitude smaller than square root of G H,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:50.880,00:11:54.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,then information actually goes towards both directions.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:54.880,00:11:57.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,And in nonlinear conservation laws,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:57.880,00:12:00.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,we are going to see situations like that all the time.
