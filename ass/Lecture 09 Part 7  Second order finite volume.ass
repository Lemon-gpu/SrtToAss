Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:06.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,What we have just derived works great for near discontinuities, but it doesn't
Dialogue: 0,00:00:06.880,00:00:15.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,really work great in smooth regions. And we can probably see this from the
Dialogue: 0,00:00:15.660,00:00:23.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,solution over here. So in this solution, can you see the obvious place
Dialogue: 0,00:00:23.580,00:00:31.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,that is not accurate? Can you see a feature of this solution where you can
Dialogue: 0,00:00:31.680,00:00:39.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,point it and say, okay, this should not be the proper behavior? Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:43.820,00:00:52.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,Exactly. So look at the slope over here and the gap between the line and y equal to 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:52.580,00:00:53.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So look at the slope over here and the gap between the line and y equal to 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:53.560,00:01:06.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,The gap should not exist. Okay? So the wave is losing magnitude even before the discontinuity forms.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:06.800,00:01:14.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So remember, before any shock wave forms, the solution follows characteristic lines.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:15.380,00:01:21.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if you follow the characteristic line of this point of x equal to a quarter,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:22.560,00:01:23.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,the characteristic line of x equal to a quarter is the same as the characteristic line of x equal to a quarter.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:23.540,00:01:27.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,The characteristic should move towards the right, and the solution along the characteristic should be what?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:29.400,00:01:34.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Constant. Yes. So if you move towards the right along the characteristic,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:34.440,00:01:39.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,the solution should stay at u equal to 1. It should not decay in magnitude.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:41.820,00:01:48.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the fact that the solution gets artificially dissipated is called what?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:50.040,00:01:52.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Artificial dissipation, right? So it's a diffusion.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:53.540,00:01:57.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,Dissipation error. So dispersion error, dissipation error, remember,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:58.120,00:02:00.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,dispersion error is moving the wave to the wrong places.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:01.720,00:02:04.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Dissipation error is artificially damping down the waves.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:06.000,00:02:12.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,The first order upwind or Godunov scheme, they both have a lot of dissipation error in it.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:14.000,00:02:17.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,And it's pretty obvious in this case.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:18.440,00:02:23.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,So how do we improve upon the scheme to make it higher order?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:23.540,00:02:24.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oops.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:24.540,00:02:35.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the idea comes from a place called reconstruction.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:36.600,00:02:42.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,The reconstruction, it's saying that we already see one case of reconstruction,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:42.400,00:02:44.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,that is the piecewise constant reconstruction.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:45.420,00:02:48.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,In the first order upwind scheme and in the Godunov scheme,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:48.440,00:02:53.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,we both have reconstructed the solution from the piecewise constant reconstruction.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:53.540,00:03:00.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we can say that the solution is not going to be a piecewise volume averages.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:00.540,00:03:02.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's draw three functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:02.540,00:03:06.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,One function is an original function that looks like that.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:06.540,00:03:07.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:07.540,00:03:20.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then the second is not a function, but just a series of numbers that is taking the value of the average.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:20.540,00:03:22.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's probably this point.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:22.540,00:03:24.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Maybe this point and here, maybe that point.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:24.540,00:03:26.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's taking the volume averages.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:27.540,00:03:30.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the third function is the reconstruction.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:31.540,00:03:37.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the reconstruction is what is not done well in the Godunov scheme.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:38.540,00:03:41.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,In Godunov scheme, we are doing a piecewise constant reconstruction.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:41.540,00:03:51.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,We are drawing a flat line over each interval that approximates the value of the function.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:51.540,00:03:57.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,And of course, if you just look at the difference between the green function and the red function,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:57.540,00:04:01.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,you can see that the approximation is not very good.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:01.540,00:04:03.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:03.540,00:04:10.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the question is, in what way can we perform a better reconstruction of the function,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:10.540,00:04:13.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,a more accurate reconstruction function?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:13.540,00:04:19.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,And so, for example, if we want a second order scheme instead of just a first order scheme,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:19.540,00:04:23.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,we can reconstruct the function using just a slightly different way.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:23.540,00:04:29.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So instead of just using the function value at this grid point,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:29.540,00:04:33.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,how can we reconstruct the function to make it better?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:33.540,00:04:36.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,For example, we can also look at the slope.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:36.540,00:04:45.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if we have the blue point over here, we know the cell average here locally is a monotonically decreasing trend.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:45.540,00:04:48.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,We can use the difference between this and this and this and this.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:48.540,00:04:55.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,To figure out, okay, can I draw a straight line like that,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:55.540,00:05:02.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,which respects the average slope between this and this and this and this?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:02.540,00:05:07.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that I actually get a better approximation to the red function.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:07.540,00:05:14.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So not just using the volume averages, but also using the derivative information,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:14.540,00:05:17.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,which we can infer from the adjacent volume averages.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:18.540,00:05:25.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's a good way to reconstruct the solution to better accuracy.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:25.540,00:05:28.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's say we have the reconstruction here.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:28.540,00:05:31.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,We also can probably perform a reconstruction here.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:31.540,00:05:35.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,The reconstruction here is a little bit more tricky, but maybe something like that.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:35.540,00:05:39.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,And over here, it may be something like that.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:39.540,00:05:41.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:41.540,00:05:45.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,We still have a piecewise continuous function.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:45.540,00:05:47.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,No longer have a piecewise constant function.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:47.540,00:05:48.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,But still.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:48.540,00:05:53.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's a piecewise linear function instead.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:53.540,00:05:58.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,We still need to figure out what is the appropriate flux to use,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:58.540,00:06:03.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,for example, around this interface, where I still have a discontinuity.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:03.540,00:06:08.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Where here, I still have a discontinuity, maybe even larger.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:08.540,00:06:10.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:10.540,00:06:15.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what do I do here?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:15.540,00:06:20.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,I can use exactly the same flux reconstruction scheme.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:20.540,00:06:24.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,I can still use the same good enough numerical flux over here.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:24.540,00:06:28.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,But instead of using just the piecewise averages,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:28.540,00:06:37.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,I can use the reconstructed value immediately on the left and on the right of that interface.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:37.540,00:06:44.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the idea we use to get second-order accuracy.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:45.540,00:06:47.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:47.540,00:06:50.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, for example,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:50.540,00:06:54.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,I hope I have enough time to do that.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:54.540,00:06:57.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I can copy my upwind.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:57.540,00:07:03.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, because I know my upwind works in this particular case,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:03.540,00:07:07.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'll just use upwind instead of changing that to good enough.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:07.540,00:07:12.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So reconstruct upwind.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:12.540,00:07:13.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:15.540,00:07:23.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:23.540,00:07:31.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So here, instead of just using the solution u to compute the flux,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:31.540,00:07:43.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm going to reconstruct at the interfaces.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:43.540,00:07:44.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:44.540,00:07:53.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, for example,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:53.540,00:07:59.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,I can compute the du dx to be,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:59.540,00:08:01.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,we are going to use central difference here,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:01.540,00:08:07.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,u of 3 to n minus u of 1 to n minus 2
Dialogue: 0,00:08:07.540,00:08:10.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,divided by 2 delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:10.540,00:08:12.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oops.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:12.540,00:08:13.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:13.540,00:08:25.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I have my du dx and my u at the right of the cell is going to be,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:25.540,00:08:29.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,let me see, u at the right of the cell.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:29.540,00:08:30.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:30.540,00:08:32.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let me also du dx is equal to,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:32.540,00:08:36.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,I also want to u at the first cell.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:36.540,00:08:41.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'll just use first-order difference minus u1.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:43.540,00:08:53.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So u at the first cell is going to be u at the right of the cell.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:53.540,00:08:55.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, u at the right of the cell is equal to u plus du dx upon 0.5 by dx.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:55.540,00:09:01.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So u at the right of the cell is equal to u plus du dx upon 0.5 by dx.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:01.540,00:09:07.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is my reconstructed value immediately on the left of u i plus half.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:07.540,00:09:08.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:08.540,00:09:09.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if I say that this is the value of u,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:09.540,00:09:10.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,I can do that.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:10.540,00:09:11.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's the result.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:11.540,00:09:23.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,the left of u i plus half u at the left of the cell is equal to u minus du dx times this
Dialogue: 0,00:09:25.380,00:09:37.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,all right so when i compute my f i also have my f at the right of the cell is equal to
Dialogue: 0,00:09:37.220,00:09:48.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,this and my f equal to left cell is equal to that
Dialogue: 0,00:09:51.140,00:09:56.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,yeah so so this this is still my first order optimus scheme if you use good enough scheme
Dialogue: 0,00:09:56.980,00:10:04.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,these are something you don't actually want to compute right you want to compute the f as you
Dialogue: 0,00:10:04.900,00:10:06.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,want to look at the u right cell and you want to add this to the right整 есте fool decía
Dialogue: 0,00:10:06.900,00:10:07.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,so но又改變了
Dialogue: 0,00:10:07.120,00:10:07.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,這 responding模式 對方的 ру HAVE YOU PUT THIS OUT
Dialogue: 0,00:10:07.200,00:10:12.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,u left cell, and you want to compute the maximum, you want to compare which one is larger, and
Dialogue: 0,00:10:12.060,00:10:15.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,you want to, depending on which one is larger, you want to compute the maximum or minimum
Dialogue: 0,00:10:15.800,00:10:17.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,of the flux within that range.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:19.540,00:10:19.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:22.000,00:10:25.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, I don't know if we have, we probably don't have time to do that.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:27.880,00:10:30.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:31.880,00:10:35.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, let me just do one thing before we finish.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:35.540,00:10:39.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, let's don't do that yet.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:39.520,00:10:43.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, the one thing we want to do before we finish is that when we look at the shock speed,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:44.740,00:10:47.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,what U should we look at?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:48.500,00:10:48.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:49.400,00:10:57.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,We want to use U of left cell for the range of 2 to n.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:57.640,00:11:04.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,We want to use left cell of I plus 1, because we are looking at the interface I plus half
Dialogue: 0,00:11:04.740,00:11:05.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,over here.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:05.180,00:11:12.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,We want to use the value immediately to the right of the interface is the value at the
Dialogue: 0,00:11:12.820,00:11:14.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,left of the next cell.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:14.720,00:11:21.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the value immediately to the left of the interface is the value at the right side of
Dialogue: 0,00:11:21.520,00:11:23.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,the cell immediately to the left.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:24.060,00:11:27.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, this is the proper shock speed to use.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:28.780,00:11:28.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:29.500,00:11:31.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,And F interface is...
Dialogue: 0,00:11:31.180,00:11:33.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,If the shock speed is greater than zero...
Dialogue: 0,00:11:33.180,00:11:35.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,If the shock speed is greater than zero...
Dialogue: 0,00:11:35.160,00:11:39.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Coming from the left, I want to use the left.
