Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:05.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,The first type of equations we are going to study is called convection diffusion
Dialogue: 0,00:00:05.040,00:00:16.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,equations. The reason we are studying this equation, partial u, partial t, plus a
Dialogue: 0,00:00:16.740,00:00:23.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,big U, which is different from the small u, partial u, partial x, equal to kappa
Dialogue: 0,00:00:23.840,00:00:32.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,partial square u, partial x square, plus f. So this is the convection diffusion
Dialogue: 0,00:00:32.080,00:00:40.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,equation. This equation has sufficient variation and complexity that it can be
Dialogue: 0,00:00:40.700,00:00:48.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,a back of the envelope model for a lot of physical problems. So not only because
Dialogue: 0,00:00:48.620,00:00:53.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's useful but also it is amenable to
Dialogue: 0,00:00:53.500,00:00:53.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,normalization.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:53.840,00:01:00.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,Not only numerical methods but also analytical methods. And the fact that it is amenable
Dialogue: 0,00:01:00.980,00:01:08.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,to analytical methods makes it a very good introductory differential equation for us
Dialogue: 0,00:01:08.560,00:01:15.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,to solve using numerical methods and then compare the result to solutions using analytical
Dialogue: 0,00:01:15.680,00:01:22.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,methods. And by doing that we can understand how accurate our numerical solution is and
Dialogue: 0,00:01:22.680,00:01:31.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,how does the accuracy vary as we change different numerical explanations like 기다� desar

Dialogue: 0,00:01:33.740,00:01:42.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for example in thermal engineering, this U can be used to describe the temperature

Dialogue: 0,00:01:52.540,00:02:01.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,want to give is the bathtub problem. So in 2016 I participated in this
Dialogue: 0,00:02:01.780,00:02:05.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,international contest of mathematical modeling when I was an undergraduate
Dialogue: 0,00:02:05.620,00:02:11.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,student and I've been following all these problems in the later years. The
Dialogue: 0,00:02:11.260,00:02:18.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,problem this year is quite interesting. It asks about a person in a bathtub. So
Dialogue: 0,00:02:18.400,00:02:23.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,he just wants to relax and having a very hot bathtub. But the temperature of
Dialogue: 0,00:02:23.840,00:02:31.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,course becomes slowly decreases as he relaxes. So he wants to keep the same
Dialogue: 0,00:02:31.360,00:02:36.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,temperature and by doing that he can turn on the faucet which dumps hot water
Dialogue: 0,00:02:36.880,00:02:43.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,into the bathtub and then shut it down by his will. And he can drain the water
Dialogue: 0,00:02:43.840,00:02:48.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,from the bathtub. So the question for the mathematical contest of modeling
Dialogue: 0,00:02:48.380,00:02:53.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,is how should he waste as little water as possible while maintaining a
Dialogue: 0,00:02:53.840,00:03:00.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,comfortable and uniform temperature distribution. So that's an interesting
Dialogue: 0,00:03:00.920,00:03:06.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,question and of course to me naturally the the appropriate answer to that is
Dialogue: 0,00:03:06.640,00:03:11.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,solving partial differential equations. And this one is a perfect model for that
Dialogue: 0,00:03:11.840,00:03:18.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,problem because we are going to see later this term can be used to model
Dialogue: 0,00:03:18.200,00:03:18.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,a
Dialogue: 0,00:03:18.360,00:03:22.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,temperature distribution. So this is a very simple model. It's going to show how
Dialogue: 0,00:03:22.860,00:03:28.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,the temperature is going to go from non uniform to more and more uniform as time
Dialogue: 0,00:03:28.920,00:03:34.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,evolves. And this term, the convection term, is going to describe the evolution
Dialogue: 0,00:03:34.260,00:03:40.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,of the temperature due to the bulk flow of water through the bathtub. And this
Dialogue: 0,00:03:40.980,00:03:46.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,term is going to describe how much heat you are losing through evaporation and
Dialogue: 0,00:03:46.200,00:03:48.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,conduction to the outside of the world.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:48.180,00:03:55.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the equation that describes the evolution time derivative of the
Dialogue: 0,00:03:55.080,00:04:03.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,temperature due to a combination of the rest of the terms. So this is one
Dialogue: 0,00:04:03.300,00:04:07.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,application of this equation. Other application include in environmental
Dialogue: 0,00:04:07.080,00:04:14.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,engineering. The same equation is used to describe the concentration of pollutant.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:14.060,00:04:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Some of you are working in the aviation and the
Dialogue: 0,00:04:18.000,00:04:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,aviation industry. And you may be interested in how pollutants in the
Dialogue: 0,00:04:24.000,00:04:31.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,atmosphere is carried by convection, which is this term, and diffusion, which
Dialogue: 0,00:04:31.500,00:04:38.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,is this term, and sources and sinks of pollutants. This is generation of the
Dialogue: 0,00:04:38.220,00:04:46.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,pollutants by cars, power stations, and removal of the pollutants by rainfall,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:46.620,00:04:47.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,for example.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:48.000,00:04:54.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,And in petroleum engineering, a very similar equation can be used to describe
Dialogue: 0,00:04:54.240,00:05:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the fraction of water or oil in the reservoir. And in financial engineering,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:00.000,00:05:06.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,the same equation can be described the price of an option. So diverse
Dialogue: 0,00:05:06.300,00:05:13.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,applications. A limiting case. So let's study a few limiting cases of this
Dialogue: 0,00:05:13.620,00:05:14.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:14.460,00:05:17.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so first of all,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:18.000,00:05:21.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,when the U is equal to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:21.000,00:05:32.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,And F is equal to zero. This is just a partial U, partial T equal to kappa, partial
Dialogue: 0,00:05:32.400,00:05:39.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,square U, partial X squared. That's called heat equation. Because it describes the
Dialogue: 0,00:05:39.420,00:05:47.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,evolution of temperature over a stationary solid object. The second case
Dialogue: 0,00:05:47.880,00:05:55.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,is, when kappa is equal to zero, F is equal to zero, the question becomes partial
Dialogue: 0,00:05:55.040,00:06:02.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,u, partial t, plus big U, times partial u, partial x, equal to zero. That is linear
Dialogue: 0,00:06:02.100,00:06:07.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,advection equation. That describes the evolution of a field driven by a
Dialogue: 0,00:06:07.960,00:06:10.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,constant wind field. And when both, when both U is equal and your T stage is a constant, if never a center positivex inverse, thezt
Dialogue: 0,00:06:10.780,00:06:15.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,New, where dm, d, t, t, and enfrentk évidemment, dm, 0. And d, t, t, p, how often
Dialogue: 0,00:06:15.680,00:06:16.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,you want to deliberate whether it is equal or opposite, now there's another way of saying that in serious
Dialogue: 0,00:06:16.740,00:06:20.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,both u is equal to zero and time goes to infinity.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:22.640,00:06:26.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,The equation becomes kappa plus your square u
Dialogue: 0,00:06:26.180,00:06:28.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,plus your x square plus f equal to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:28.900,00:06:30.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,So time goes away.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:31.780,00:06:33.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,That equation is called Poisson's equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:34.840,00:06:37.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,It describes the equilibrium state
Dialogue: 0,00:06:38.740,00:06:41.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,of certain physical phenomenons,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:41.140,00:06:44.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,like elasticity and diffusion.
