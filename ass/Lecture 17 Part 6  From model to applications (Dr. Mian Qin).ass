Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:03.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so that's how to run a parametric sweep.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:03.960,00:00:05.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,You add a global parameter.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:05.880,00:00:12.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,You use that parameter to drive any part of the model, including the geometry or any physical
Dialogue: 0,00:00:12.080,00:00:17.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,calculations or even mesh nodes, mesh density, and then you can compute and then compare
Dialogue: 0,00:00:17.400,00:00:19.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,the results.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:19.620,00:00:23.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,I do want to show you the very last step, was converting from model to an app.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:23.960,00:00:29.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,I won't go into too much details here because I think we are getting closer with time.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:29.600,00:00:32.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I have 14 more minutes, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:32.140,00:00:33.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,To 1055?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:33.140,00:00:34.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:34.140,00:00:43.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what I'll do is I will show you app building 101 or even 000.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:43.560,00:00:51.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what I'll do is I'll pick one model that's already built and solved in COMSOL in the
Dialogue: 0,00:00:51.100,00:00:53.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,... Let's see.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:53.480,00:00:57.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,So first of all, how to get here.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:57.100,00:00:59.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,When you ... After you install the trial of COMSOL, go to ...
Dialogue: 0,00:00:59.480,00:00:59.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:59.580,00:01:01.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,... File, Application Library.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:01.820,00:01:05.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,Here's the collection of examples we have built with each of the module.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:05.400,00:01:10.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So before you want to build a molecular flow problem, don't do it yet.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:10.760,00:01:14.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Go into one of the example, open the PDF.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:14.280,00:01:18.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,Each of the example comes with a PDF including a background introduction of that particular
Dialogue: 0,00:01:18.520,00:01:26.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,example plus some meaningful results and analysis plus a step-by-step instruction of how this
Dialogue: 0,00:01:26.520,00:01:27.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,model was built.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:27.740,00:01:29.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So duplicate a couple of them.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:29.460,00:01:33.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,Just to familiarize yourself with the workflow and where to find out different options.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:33.520,00:01:37.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or hopefully there is even an example that's similar to exactly what you want to do.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:37.700,00:01:40.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then make changes on that and start building your own model.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:40.660,00:01:46.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what I'll use right here ... Well, so first of all, before you attend Wednesday's class,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:46.140,00:01:50.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,I would strongly recommend you to go through the COMSOL multi-physics, which is the base
Dialogue: 0,00:01:50.480,00:01:53.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,package and the equation-based examples here.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:53.400,00:01:57.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So some of those, Tammy will be explaining a lot more details, but it doesn't hurt to
Dialogue: 0,00:01:57.260,00:01:58.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,just have a preview of those.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:58.460,00:01:59.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:59.460,00:02:05.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So right now, to demonstrate the app building, I'm going to use one under multi-physics and
Dialogue: 0,00:02:05.960,00:02:07.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's called the BossBar.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:07.960,00:02:11.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm going to open that model.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:11.080,00:02:15.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you do want to know how to build this BossBar, which is another dual heating problem, that's
Dialogue: 0,00:02:15.160,00:02:16.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,intro booklet.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:16.160,00:02:18.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,There are two examples you can work through.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:18.460,00:02:20.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,Again, step-by-step instructions.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:20.340,00:02:22.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,The second one is this BossBar one.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:22.740,00:02:27.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mentioned that this example, although it's electrical and heat transfer so far, it can
Dialogue: 0,00:02:27.180,00:02:28.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,easily become a fluid flow problem.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:28.460,00:02:33.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because you can add a surrounding box and introduce convective cooling, which is a lot
Dialogue: 0,00:02:33.700,00:02:38.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,of times happens in especially older generation laptop when you have a fan inside that helps
Dialogue: 0,00:02:38.860,00:02:41.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,you have the cooling of the actual component.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:41.900,00:02:44.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you can add fluid flow on top of that.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:44.560,00:02:46.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's what I mean.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:46.500,00:02:48.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So here is the working model.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:48.080,00:02:49.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Again, it's soft.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:49.080,00:02:50.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,It has colorful images.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:50.080,00:02:52.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's the actual current plus heat transfer.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:52.420,00:02:57.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,I want to use this one because it already has a defined parameter list that controls
Dialogue: 0,00:02:57.280,00:02:58.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,the different parts of the system.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:58.340,00:03:00.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,So how do I convert this model to an app?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:00.800,00:03:07.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you are using Windows and you have the console ribbon on the top and you'll see the
Dialogue: 0,00:03:07.620,00:03:10.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,first button here is called Application Builder.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:10.140,00:03:13.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Hit the Application Builder button.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:13.840,00:03:17.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now you are switched from Model Builder to Application Builder.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:17.360,00:03:21.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,There is a button to switch you back, again, on the Home tab, the first tab here.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:21.460,00:03:25.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the two key concepts here I want to introduce is a new form and a new method.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:25.140,00:03:28.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,A new form is essentially the layout of your user-defined app.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:28.340,00:03:33.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you add a new form, you tell CommSol what you want to include on that front panel.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:33.960,00:03:35.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's like LabVIEW for those of you who know.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:36.480,00:03:41.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, for example, I want my user to be able to change a few parameters.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:42.040,00:03:44.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,I want them to be able to see what is the temperature plot.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:45.200,00:03:48.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,I want to give them some buttons, for example, a compute button.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:49.100,00:03:49.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's it.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:50.120,00:03:52.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's the layout of the app.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:52.620,00:03:53.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,I could move things around.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:53.840,00:03:54.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's essentially a PowerPoint.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:54.820,00:03:57.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,I could resize the graphics window.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:58.340,00:04:02.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then when you hit test application, it'll just work.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:03.980,00:04:07.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,You could either run the app through a CommSol license or CommSol server license.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:08.200,00:04:12.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,The demo.comsol.com link I gave earlier allows you to upload and run apps.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:13.100,00:04:18.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,So anywhere you are, as long as you have internet access, you don't have to use a Windows machine to run an app.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:18.860,00:04:21.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any platform, including your iPhone, would be able to run an app.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:21.880,00:04:23.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you can just log into that website.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:24.480,00:04:28.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Either upload or if you already saved it out, then you can just hit compute.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:28.540,00:04:30.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Change one of the parameters.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:30.320,00:04:31.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,It'll work and it'll give you the results.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:32.860,00:04:36.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is not, well, this is the very simple version of it.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:36.480,00:04:38.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,You can also add a method.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:39.000,00:04:42.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So method is essentially a JavaScript environment.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:42.900,00:04:45.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I myself don't know any Java.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:45.340,00:04:46.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So how am I going to demonstrate it?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:47.100,00:04:49.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm going to record a code.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:49.960,00:04:55.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now everything here shows in a round box, a red box.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:55.640,00:04:57.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to switch back to Model Builder.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:57.520,00:04:58.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Say if I share.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:58.540,00:05:02.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm going to change any part of the model from 6 to 8.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:02.940,00:05:03.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'll do something else.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:04.160,00:05:07.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Change the mesh to user defined.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:07.300,00:05:08.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,Build a mesh.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:08.780,00:05:11.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I could stop recording, go back to my app builder.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:12.080,00:05:14.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Everything I did will be recorded as a JavaScript.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:15.000,00:05:16.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So at least you know where to go.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:17.080,00:05:23.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,And now instead of 8, I'm smart enough to know I can change that 8 into a different parameter and that'll still work.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:23.740,00:05:26.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then on top of that, you can add more things.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:26.860,00:05:27.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,So.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:27.660,00:05:34.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'll show you one example that everybody knows and the beauty of it is actually play some sound.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:35.080,00:05:36.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to find.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:36.500,00:05:37.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, so every application.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:38.020,00:05:40.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the ones with the app interface is in the application folder.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:41.220,00:05:43.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,Each of the module has an application folder.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:43.420,00:05:47.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the ACDC example with the app interface that's actually in that folder.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:48.280,00:05:49.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to show you a tuning fork.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:51.460,00:05:53.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Directly hit run app.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:54.020,00:05:55.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Don't save the change.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:57.660,00:06:00.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is a tuning fork app.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:00.980,00:06:01.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,It runs in two modes.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:02.120,00:06:06.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,You can tell Comso how long the tuning fork forks are.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:07.380,00:06:08.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,The prone length.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:08.660,00:06:09.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,And it computes.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:10.200,00:06:12.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's going to tell you the natural frequency.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:15.840,00:06:17.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that is what a
Dialogue: 0,00:06:17.620,00:06:20.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,455.6 Hz sounds like.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:21.220,00:06:25.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,The other mode it works on is actually a combination of structural mechanics and optimization.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:26.080,00:06:26.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I want to.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:27.100,00:06:27.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:27.860,00:06:28.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,I want to.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:28.680,00:06:29.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,You know maybe.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:29.460,00:06:30.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,Next to a 3D printer.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:30.900,00:06:31.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,I want to say I want to.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:32.420,00:06:35.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,50, 90, 490 Hz.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:35.600,00:06:38.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,Tell me how long that the prone length should be.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:39.440,00:06:43.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's going to take slightly longer because of the optimization algorithm here.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:47.620,00:06:49.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,And by the way to add that optimization.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:49.420,00:06:52.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Literally one expression in one step of the solver.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:52.500,00:06:53.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,Not complicated at all.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:57.660,00:06:58.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you can see that.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:58.680,00:06:59.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's going to be.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:59.460,00:06:59.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,A little bit.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:00.220,00:07:00.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,A little bit.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:00.980,00:07:01.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,A little bit.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:01.760,00:07:02.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,Slightly higher pitch.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:02.780,00:07:06.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you have good ears you can tell the difference between 450 and 490.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:06.620,00:07:10.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or if you are tuning your violin you can maybe use the app as well.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:13.540,00:07:16.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right so that's the very last step here from the model to the app.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:17.120,00:07:20.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,So app is essentially a model plus a user interface.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:20.700,00:07:24.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,And by user interface we mean not only just the front cover of it.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:24.800,00:07:25.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Like the W.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:25.560,00:07:26.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,But also the back wires.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:26.840,00:07:28.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,Which is what makes the buttons work.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:28.640,00:07:29.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you can associate different.
