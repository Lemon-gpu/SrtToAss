Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:05.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, right? You will basically get something like a singularity, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:05.880,00:00:15.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right, is it clear so far? So these are the kind of things you will be thinking when you are
Dialogue: 0,00:00:15.760,00:00:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,adding this. So the final item example I want to talk here is, it's in the blog so you can read
Dialogue: 0,00:00:24.000,00:00:31.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,that for more details I'll show you, but thermal curing. So in thermal curing what you have is
Dialogue: 0,00:00:31.200,00:00:37.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,these two equations. Now the first one is a heat transfer equation where you have a source term
Dialogue: 0,00:00:37.080,00:00:47.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,coming from the curing process if alpha is the curing rate. So then in the second one you have
Dialogue: 0,00:00:47.220,00:00:53.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,just an equation for the curing rate. So this is a heat transfer equation, and I'll give you a
Dialogue: 0,00:00:53.940,00:00:53.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,little bit of a summary of this. So this is a heat transfer equation. So this is a heat transfer
Dialogue: 0,00:00:53.980,00:01:00.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,equation. This is the Arrhenius equation. A lot of chemical kinetics kind of problems take that
Dialogue: 0,00:01:00.280,00:01:08.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,form. Now the first question is what interfaces are we going to use to solve this? Normally you
Dialogue: 0,00:01:08.880,00:01:12.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,would use the heat transfer interface for the first equation since we have already implemented
Dialogue: 0,00:01:12.880,00:01:19.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,that. But assume you are going to use equation-based modeling entirely. What would you use
Dialogue: 0,00:01:19.160,00:01:22.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,for the first one? What interface would you use?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:22.740,00:01:31.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any of the PDE interfaces would work, right? Let's say coefficient-borne PDE. How about the second equation?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:31.440,00:01:42.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,The ODE interface, right? Because there is no special derivative there. So if you don't have special
Dialogue: 0,00:01:42.240,00:01:48.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,derivatives you have to use the ODE interfaces. But we have two ODE interfaces. Domain ODE and Global ODE.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:48.900,00:01:50.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Which one should you use?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:50.060,00:01:50.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,The domain ODE.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:50.700,00:01:51.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,The domain ODE.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:51.200,00:01:51.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,The domain ODE.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:51.700,00:01:52.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,The domain ODE.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:52.100,00:01:52.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,The domain ODE.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:52.600,00:01:52.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,The domain ODE.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:52.680,00:01:52.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,The domain ODE.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:52.740,00:01:53.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,The domain ODE.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:53.680,00:01:53.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,The domain ODE.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:53.960,00:01:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Domain? Global? Which one?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:56.000,00:02:00.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:00.880,00:02:02.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Why would you say domain ODE?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:02.840,00:02:05.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because alpha can be a functional spatial.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:05.920,00:02:12.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,Why can alpha be a function of space? In that equation, in the second equation, is there anything that
Dialogue: 0,00:02:12.480,00:02:14.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,would make alpha a function of space?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:14.480,00:02:15.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,Initial value.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:15.720,00:02:22.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's say, okay, let's say, that's a good way. Let's say initial values are fixed. Let's say that value A is
Dialogue: 0,00:02:22.680,00:02:31.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,fixed, EA is fixed, all parameters in that equation are fixed. Is it still a domain
Dialogue: 0,00:02:31.440,00:02:41.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,or a global ODE? Are you sure? T is a function, it's coupled right? So on its own yes it
Dialogue: 0,00:02:41.740,00:02:46.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,would it was almost a global ODE, a domain ODE if everything was constant
Dialogue: 0,00:02:46.740,00:02:51.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,but we are coupling this to temperature and the temperature is a PDE which can
Dialogue: 0,00:02:51.620,00:02:55.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,have different solutions so the fact that the temperature is affecting the
Dialogue: 0,00:02:55.700,00:03:03.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,curing rate would necessarily we use the domain ODE feature. Is it clear? So if we
Dialogue: 0,00:03:03.800,00:03:12.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,are doing that here you can add this will also revisit the coupling. How do
Dialogue: 0,00:03:12.180,00:03:15.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,you now couple because there is a coupling term right? Here in the
Dialogue: 0,00:03:15.660,00:03:21.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,coefficient form we just specify in this equation EA these are the diffusion
Dialogue: 0,00:03:21.300,00:03:21.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,coefficients.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:21.620,00:03:27.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,from the first equation, no source terms originally or we can write the source
Dialogue: 0,00:03:27.940,00:03:34.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,term here. There is a source term right that there is this term but the way to
Dialogue: 0,00:03:34.500,00:03:39.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,add that then is to your coefficient form or EA you can add a
Dialogue: 0,00:03:39.920,00:03:44.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,source term if you right click this and say source and that source term you see
Dialogue: 0,00:03:44.780,00:03:49.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,this declaration d alpha t make it a function of the other variable now you
Dialogue: 0,00:03:49.280,00:03:51.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,have coupled it and then in the second domain ODE, you can add this to the coefficient form.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:51.620,00:03:54.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you have coupled this to the coefficient form and then in the third
Dialogue: 0,00:03:54.620,00:03:58.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,domain ODE then this source term that you have to type make it a function of
Dialogue: 0,00:03:58.460,00:04:09.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,temperature. So now you have coupled both. Is it clear? Questions? So then I
Dialogue: 0,00:04:09.860,00:04:15.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,will skip through this verification and validation and give you the homework.
