Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:06.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,If u0 is equal to u, it's still going to be u, exactly.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:06.680,00:00:12.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is because we just wrote the equation without the superscripts, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:12.900,00:00:19.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Without the superscript, the equation is exactly satisfied by the solution to the linear equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:20.480,00:00:27.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if u0 is already u, then the left-hand side is u1.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:27.420,00:00:31.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,And u1 has to be also u in order for this equation to be satisfied.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:32.720,00:00:38.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well, unless d is degenerate, unless d has zero entries, it's a diagonal matrix, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:38.300,00:00:43.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if all the diagonal parts are non-zero, then u1 can only be u.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:45.440,00:00:48.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,And therefore, if u1 is equal to u, u2 also has to be u.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:48.960,00:00:51.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,If u2 has to be u, u3 also has to be u, etc.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:51.660,00:00:56.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you start it with the right solution, you'll always end up with the right solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:57.680,00:00:59.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,Of course, that's a big assumption, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:59.660,00:01:02.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you almost never start with the right solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:03.000,00:01:04.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what do you get?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:04.720,00:01:07.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,What do you get if you don't have the right solution to start with?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:08.220,00:01:09.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's define.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:10.080,00:01:12.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's look at now the error equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:13.380,00:01:15.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the error equation is looking at,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:15.280,00:01:26.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,so if I define solution error ek to be the difference between the solution I have minus the real solution,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:27.420,00:01:35.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,well, in practice, I never know what ek is because I don't know the true solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:36.660,00:01:42.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,But if I can derive a governing equation for the evolution of ek,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:42.880,00:01:48.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,we can analyze is the solution error becoming smaller and smaller or becoming larger and larger as I iterate.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:48.880,00:01:56.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we want to construct the method or derive conditions for the method so that ek is going to,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:56.880,00:01:57.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,you know,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:57.020,00:01:57.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,you know,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:57.080,00:01:57.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,you know,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:57.140,00:01:57.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,you know,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:57.400,00:01:57.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,you know,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:57.420,00:01:59.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,decreasing as I increase k.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:00.400,00:02:03.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,So how do we derive the equation for ek?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:04.160,00:02:08.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,We subtract this equation with the superscript.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:10.080,00:02:16.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,We subtract the equation without a superscript from the equation with the superscript.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:18.160,00:02:24.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,By doing this, the left-hand side would be du k plus 1 minus du.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:24.880,00:02:27.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,The right-hand side would be b,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:27.400,00:02:28.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,minus l,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:28.520,00:02:28.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,u,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:28.960,00:02:29.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,k,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:29.580,00:02:30.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,minus u,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:30.620,00:02:31.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,u,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:31.020,00:02:31.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,k,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:31.520,00:02:35.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,minus b,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:35.520,00:02:36.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,minus l,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:36.220,00:02:36.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,u,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:36.760,00:02:37.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,minus u,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:37.600,00:02:38.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,u.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:38.100,00:02:40.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:40.200,00:02:42.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is just subtracting two equalities.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:43.000,00:02:44.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,Both are true.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:45.720,00:02:49.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,And simply by linearity and the definition of ek,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:49.720,00:02:53.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,the left-hand side becomes d of ek plus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:55.620,00:02:56.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the right-hand side,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:56.640,00:02:57.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,the b,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:57.380,00:02:58.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,fortunately,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:58.180,00:02:58.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,cancels.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:58.780,00:03:05.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,What we are left with is l plus u,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:05.480,00:03:08.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I think we have a minus sign here,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:08.100,00:03:09.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,times ek.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:09.380,00:03:16.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the last thing we want to do is further simplify this by multiplying a d inverse.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:16.580,00:03:22.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,Remember, the method only works if d has non-zero diagonals.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:22.780,00:03:26.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's multiply a d inverse on both equations,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:26.500,00:03:26.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,both equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:26.980,00:03:31.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the left-hand side becomes ek plus 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:31.480,00:03:37.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,the right-hand side becomes minus d inverse times l plus u times ek.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:37.780,00:03:40.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,Good here?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:40.420,00:03:47.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we can start analyzing whether the ek would increase or decrease over time.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:47.580,00:03:53.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,What determines if ek is going to increase or decrease over time?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:53.660,00:03:54.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,The eigenvalue.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:54.780,00:03:55.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes, the eigenvalue.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:55.780,00:03:56.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:56.180,00:03:56.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the eigenvalue is going to be the eigenvalue of the equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:56.780,00:03:58.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,The eigenvalue of this matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:58.680,00:04:01.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,This matrix is so important it has a name.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:01.940,00:04:06.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's called the iteration matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:06.480,00:04:14.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this matrix determines, actually, the stability of this matrix determines if the ek is going
Dialogue: 0,00:04:14.960,00:04:17.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,to increase over time or decrease over time.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:17.980,00:04:19.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:19.180,00:04:26.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,So because if this matrix, if the iteration matrix, well, the iteration matrix of Jacobi
Dialogue: 0,00:04:26.700,00:04:36.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,iteration or Jacobi iteration matrix can be expressed as eigenvalue recomposition v times
Dialogue: 0,00:04:36.240,00:04:46.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,lambda times the inverse, okay, then if we can say E zero, our initial error, which of
Dialogue: 0,00:04:46.480,00:04:55.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,course we don't know, can be expressed as a summation of a times vi where vi
Dialogue: 0,00:04:55.380,00:04:56.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,is a operated function.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:56.700,00:04:59.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,v i is the columns of the matrix v.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:01.980,00:05:09.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, the same expression can be written as the matrix v times a vector a,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:09.220,00:05:11.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,so a1, et cetera, to an.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:13.460,00:05:18.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right, so this is a, so if the iteration matrix is,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:19.880,00:05:24.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,has a full set of eigenvalues, we can basically write it like that, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:24.500,00:05:35.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,Write any vector to be v times a vector corresponding to the linear combination of the eigenvectors that gives you that vector.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:35.720,00:05:35.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:37.040,00:05:39.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Why isn't that the lambda?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:40.400,00:05:43.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Shouldn't that be the lambda matrix?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:44.420,00:05:46.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Aren't we, like, decoupling?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:48.380,00:05:51.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,Why is it lambda here?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:51.980,00:05:52.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Why not?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:53.020,00:05:53.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Here?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:54.500,00:05:56.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Which equation are you looking at?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:56.320,00:05:57.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Sorry, yeah, right there.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:57.600,00:06:05.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, yeah, this is, we are just trying to express the initial error in our initial guess
Dialogue: 0,00:06:05.700,00:06:09.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,as a linear combination of the columns in v.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:09.800,00:06:11.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, sorry, I didn't think of that.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:12.000,00:06:23.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right, so if we can do that, then e1 is going to be v times lambda times v inverse times e0.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:24.500,00:06:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:25.000,00:06:32.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,Which, by this expression, is v times lambda times v inverse times v times this vector a.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:34.280,00:06:34.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:36.220,00:06:39.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, and this v inverse and v cancels.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:40.260,00:06:47.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we get v times lambda times vector a.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:49.460,00:06:50.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,We can keep going.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:50.860,00:06:54.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, now, instead of v times a,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:55.140,00:06:56.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,we can keep going.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:56.260,00:06:58.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so e1 is going to be v times lambda times a.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:58.360,00:07:00.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,We can do the same trick again.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:00.660,00:07:03.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,e2 would be equal to going through the same thing.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:04.100,00:07:08.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,We would have v lambda v inverse times v lambda a.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:09.200,00:07:10.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,And again, this cancels.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:11.140,00:07:14.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,We get a v times lambda square times a.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:15.680,00:07:17.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we can keep going, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:17.020,00:07:24.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, e to the kth index would be v times lambda to the kth power.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:24.500,00:07:32.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,times a. So as long as the diagonal entries of lambdas are all less than 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:32.380,00:07:41.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,right, or if it's complex, its magnitude has to be less than 1, and then
Dialogue: 0,00:07:41.020,00:07:48.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,this ek would ultimately diminish to 0. We would be happy that we have a
Dialogue: 0,00:07:48.200,00:07:55.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,convergent iterative method which means ek is going to go to 0, and what
Dialogue: 0,00:07:55.040,00:08:01.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,does ek goes to 0 mean? my uk is going to converge to u.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:01.320,00:08:07.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,So although I don't know what u is, I mean when k is sufficiently large, I have
Dialogue: 0,00:08:07.420,00:08:17.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,a sufficiently accurate approximation to you. Alright, and also
Dialogue: 0,00:08:17.940,00:08:26.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,here we are lucky that we can check how well we are converging because we also
Dialogue: 0,00:08:26.060,00:08:33.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,have the residual that is we can check conversions by looking at the residual
Dialogue: 0,00:08:33.320,00:08:45.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,K equal to B minus a UK so this should be zero if UK is already you right so
Dialogue: 0,00:08:45.200,00:08:57.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,this is a good criterion for convergence and by the way the convergence here is
Dialogue: 0,00:08:57.860,00:09:02.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,different from the convergence of a numerical method of a finite difference
Dialogue: 0,00:09:02.360,00:09:07.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,discretization or a finite element discretization when we talk about
Dialogue: 0,00:09:07.580,00:09:12.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,convergence in finite difference we are thinking oh okay so let's decrease our
Dialogue: 0,00:09:12.460,00:09:15.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,grid size by a factor of two
Dialogue: 0,00:09:15.200,00:09:21.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,should my numerical solution approach the analytical solution right so that is
Dialogue: 0,00:09:21.700,00:09:27.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,the kind of convergence we are talking about in finite difference or finite
Dialogue: 0,00:09:27.320,00:09:31.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,element or finite volume but here convergence has a different meaning
Dialogue: 0,00:09:31.820,00:09:36.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,although we all use the word convergence it actually means different things
Dialogue: 0,00:09:36.220,00:09:44.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,convergence here means the convergence of the kth iteration to the discrete
Dialogue: 0,00:09:44.300,00:09:44.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,solution
Dialogue: 0,00:09:45.200,00:09:52.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,of a PD right so so the because a u equal to B is already a discretized
Dialogue: 0,00:09:52.980,00:09:59.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,differential equation so even if I get the exact u here the u would be a
Dialogue: 0,00:09:59.420,00:10:06.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,discrete solution and this UK is an approximation to the discrete solution
Dialogue: 0,00:10:06.360,00:10:13.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,we are talking about how does UK converge to the discrete solution here
Dialogue: 0,00:10:13.780,00:10:14.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,well that makes sense so that's the first thing we are talking about here
Dialogue: 0,00:10:14.300,00:10:21.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,well that means when you solve the equation using intuitive methods you are
Dialogue: 0,00:10:21.500,00:10:26.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,making two approximations here one approximation is of of course the
Dialogue: 0,00:10:26.540,00:10:32.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,discretization of the PDE the numerical solution only approximate the analytical
Dialogue: 0,00:10:32.060,00:10:38.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,solution up to an approximation error and the second is that you are that of
Dialogue: 0,00:10:38.100,00:10:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,course both involves spatial discretization and time discretization if
Dialogue: 0,00:10:42.000,00:10:44.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,you have time so so remember you can go to the internet and you can go to the
Dialogue: 0,00:10:44.160,00:10:44.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,computer and you can go to the computer and you can go to the computer and you
Dialogue: 0,00:10:44.300,00:10:48.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,have the spatial terms also you have time derivative squarization terms and
Dialogue: 0,00:10:48.680,00:10:53.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,now if you have space and time squarization you count that as two
Dialogue: 0,00:10:53.340,00:10:58.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,sources of errors now this is a third source of error that is when K is not
Dialogue: 0,00:10:58.280,00:11:06.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,sufficiently large you not even have an exact solution to the discrete equations
Dialogue: 0,00:11:06.280,00:11:14.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,right you can estimate how much error you have by looking at the residual but
Dialogue: 0,00:11:14.780,00:11:19.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,then remember that's a another source of approximation another source of error
