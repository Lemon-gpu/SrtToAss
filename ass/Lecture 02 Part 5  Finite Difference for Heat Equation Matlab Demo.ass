Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:10.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So construction of A, so let's say n is equal to, let's do, for example, n is equal to 100.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:12.260,00:00:17.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we are going to be, A is going to be equal to zeros of n.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:17.940,00:00:21.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,So A is initialized as all zeros.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:21.600,00:00:24.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you look at A, A is 100 by 100 double.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:25.360,00:00:25.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:25.660,00:00:30.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we are going to loop over I and set the diagonals.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:31.660,00:00:38.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So A of I, I is going to be equal to, I forget to set the coefficients.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:39.380,00:00:43.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,So A has to be 2 kappa over delta x squared times 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:43.400,00:00:43.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:43.620,00:00:45.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's break for now.

Dialogue: 0,00:00:46.580,00:00:47.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,I pressed control C.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:49.120,00:00:49.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:49.480,00:00:52.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,We need to set kappa, for example, equal to 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:53.420,00:00:55.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we set dx is equal to.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:55.660,00:00:57.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:59.880,00:01:04.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,When n is equal to 100, it should be 1 over n.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:05.380,00:01:05.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:07.860,00:01:11.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Do you see that clearly or should I make the font a little bit larger?

Dialogue: 0,00:01:32.260,00:01:32.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,14.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:33.220,00:01:33.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Big enough.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:36.500,00:01:37.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Good enough.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:38.040,00:01:38.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:38.680,00:01:38.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:39.600,00:01:42.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I think I made a bug when I'm initializing A.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:44.020,00:01:45.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,What's the bug?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:45.040,00:01:45.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:47.420,00:01:49.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Should A be an n by n matrix?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:51.960,00:01:52.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,No.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:52.680,00:01:55.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because U goes from 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:55.640,00:01:57.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's 1 to n minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:57.640,00:01:58.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:58.140,00:02:02.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So when I have n intervals, I only have n minus 1 unknowns.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:02.640,00:02:06.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So A is 0 to n minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:06.640,00:02:09.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's a 99 by 99 matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:09.640,00:02:15.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's go through the loop again.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:15.640,00:02:18.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,A of i and i is equal to what?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:18.640,00:02:24.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Minus 2 kappa divided by delta x squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:24.640,00:02:25.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:25.700,00:02:28.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's a nineteen exponential prime, a negative third.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:28.080,00:02:28.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So my�를 proof right then.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:28.640,00:02:34.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,A of ietas is equal to 10 plus 6.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:34.240,00:02:34.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:34.580,00:02:39.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's a seven each NOT this time.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:39.140,00:02:46.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So my
Dialogue: 0,00:02:46.040,00:02:49.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,My compare we have one slash k due to that index.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:49.000,00:02:51.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's a negative n minus one right now.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:51.600,00:02:51.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:51.800,00:02:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:52.000,00:02:52.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,Your way.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:52.400,00:02:52.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:52.600,00:02:53.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,You just.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:53.060,00:02:53.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,You could return and convert to minus 15.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:53.840,00:02:54.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Of A it gives you bunch things to make it.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:54.540,00:02:54.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean what?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:54.940,00:02:55.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:55.080,00:02:55.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:55.240,00:03:00.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, we have n diagonals.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:00.240,00:03:02.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,By the way, I think I made a mistake again.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:02.520,00:03:06.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,I looped all the way to n, which makes the matrix 100 by 100 again.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:06.880,00:03:12.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,So a fix for that is a is equal to 1 to 99, 1 to 99.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:12.400,00:03:16.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,That will make it back to 99 by 99 again.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:16.620,00:03:23.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this kind of indexing is what MATLAB does to index a range of i's.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:23.920,00:03:29.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so let's loop over the upper and lower diagonals.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:29.360,00:03:33.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's remember there is only n minus 2 upper and lower diagonals.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:33.840,00:03:36.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,There is n minus 1 diagonals.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:36.300,00:03:43.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So a of i and i plus 1 should be... there is no minus 2, so just a k divided by delta
Dialogue: 0,00:03:43.200,00:03:44.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,x square.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:44.900,00:03:51.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,So is the lower diagonal.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:51.100,00:03:53.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:53.500,00:03:56.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now if you look at a, it's still a 99 by 99 double.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:56.780,00:03:57.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's good.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:57.780,00:04:02.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the upper and lower diagonals are something positive.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:02.400,00:04:03.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:03.620,00:04:05.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's good.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:05.620,00:04:08.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's also construct b.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:08.740,00:04:17.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,b is a zeros n minus 1 by 1 matrix, which is a column vector.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:17.740,00:04:23.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,If I just do zeros n minus 1, it will make me a n minus 1 by n minus 1 matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:23.020,00:04:23.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:23.500,00:04:29.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,Which is not going to crash my computer in this case.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:29.780,00:04:36.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,But in other cases, I think I was teaching a method that uses Monte Carlo method.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:36.660,00:04:41.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,And somebody is supposed to make a random number array of something like many millions
Dialogue: 0,00:04:41.920,00:04:44.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,of numbers.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:44.080,00:04:50.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,So there are students who just typed a random n where n is many millions.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:50.140,00:04:51.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it tries to make a random matrix of several million by several millions.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:51.780,00:04:52.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's going to make a random matrix of several million by several millions.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:52.780,00:04:57.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the computer hangs there.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:57.600,00:05:01.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So MATLAB is kind of evil in that sense.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:01.080,00:05:02.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,Be very careful.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:02.380,00:05:05.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,So b is going to be a vector.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:05.020,00:05:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And b1 is going to be set to be something special.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:08.000,00:05:09.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:09.000,00:05:12.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's set u0 is equal to, let's say, 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:12.460,00:05:14.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,u1 is equal to minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:14.260,00:05:17.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's the boundary conditions.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:17.160,00:05:20.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,b1 is then going to be, is equal to kappa divided by dx squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:20.740,00:05:21.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:21.740,00:05:22.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:22.740,00:05:22.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:22.780,00:05:26.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,times u0.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:26.820,00:05:34.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,And b at the very last, which in MATLAB, you can do bn is equal to the same thing times
Dialogue: 0,00:05:34.720,00:05:35.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,u1.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:35.720,00:05:44.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, if you look at b, b is the, is a vector of something, all zeros, and something else.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:44.960,00:05:46.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,??
Dialogue: 0,00:05:46.860,00:05:47.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:47.640,00:05:50.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,I use the, you want to denote the

Dialogue: 0,00:05:51.600,00:05:52.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,I know, yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:52.600,00:05:55.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,x equal to 1, not r equal to 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:55.240,00:05:56.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, I understand that.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:56.240,00:05:59.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,But if you're sort of, I mean, it's not wrong right now,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:59.120,00:06:01.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,but if you're going to refer to the next,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:02.320,00:06:07.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,if you're going to look at the other u's that are in the matrix,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:07.860,00:06:11.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,then is there a possible conclusion with the wrong figure later?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:13.000,00:06:15.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so are you arguing about the naming of the variable?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:15.920,00:06:16.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:16.340,00:06:17.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, that's fine.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:18.440,00:06:18.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, that's fine.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:18.980,00:06:24.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's do un is equal to u1, and how do you delete a variable?

Dialogue: 0,00:06:33.520,00:06:33.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,Good.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:34.400,00:06:45.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's use our favorite ODE solver here, new file function dudt.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:46.240,00:06:48.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so let's say dudt.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:48.980,00:06:58.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,So ax plus b is equal to dudt of, I need to put t and u.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:58.360,00:07:06.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So usually an ODE solver expects the solution to be a function of t and u.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:07.760,00:07:14.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So ax plus b is equal to a times u, well, it's au plus b.
