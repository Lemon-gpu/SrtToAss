Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:16.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Another thing is if you sum up A over one of the dimensions, it should be zero everywhere.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:16.200,00:00:25.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that's just because if you look at the formula, if you sum up over all the i's,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:25.860,00:00:45.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,if you sum up over all the i's, over each element, a, k, the sum of the three gradients should be what?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:47.660,00:00:53.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if we have three basis functions that lie on a triangle,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:53.580,00:00:55.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,every basis function is one at one of the vertices.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:55.860,00:00:57.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,And zero at the other two vertices.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:58.360,00:01:01.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you sum up these three basis functions, what do you get?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:03.000,00:01:08.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,The sum of the three basis functions should be equal to what at every vertex?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:09.060,00:01:10.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Should be one, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:10.620,00:01:12.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the whole basis function should be one.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:12.300,00:01:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The whole summation should be one across the whole element.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:17.080,00:01:21.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,Therefore, the gradient, the summation of the three gradients should be what?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:23.980,00:01:24.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,Zero, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:24.820,00:01:25.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because the summation of the gradients should be one.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:25.860,00:01:28.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,The gradients is equal to the gradient of the summation, which is a constant.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:29.520,00:01:32.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you sum over the gradients, it should be one.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:32.880,00:01:38.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,So therefore, when you sum over each row, you should get exactly zero for the matrix A.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:39.680,00:01:42.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that also, of course, means the matrix is singular.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:44.380,00:01:46.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,We haven't defined boundary conditions yet.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:46.640,00:01:49.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,The matrix without the boundary condition is going to be singular.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:49.440,00:01:51.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:51.400,00:01:54.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now let's figure out how do we set the boundary condition.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:55.860,00:02:01.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now we have here, remember we figured out all the boundary indices, IB.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:02.920,00:02:14.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's define a logical array that is true for all the interior points and false for all the boundary points.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:15.520,00:02:23.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's say, okay, interior is equal to one's number of points, one.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:24.020,00:02:24.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:25.860,00:02:33.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,Interior is equal to, okay, so let's say we already have IB, right, being the boundary points.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:33.600,00:02:35.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,IB, is it IB here?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:36.180,00:02:38.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,IB, yes, is equal to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:39.160,00:02:43.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,So interior is going to be one in the interior and zero on the boundary.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:44.000,00:02:47.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,And let's convert it into a logical array.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:48.120,00:02:50.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that instead of one and zero, it will be true and false.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:50.980,00:02:55.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,That will allow us to index the matrix with that logical array.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:55.860,00:03:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So my A is going to be A interior, interior.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:00.000,00:03:00.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,Interior.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:01.920,00:03:02.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,Interior.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:08.760,00:03:09.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:10.440,00:03:20.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that will reduce the dimension of the matrix, get rid of the boundary dimension, the boundary grid points that I don't need in the matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:21.360,00:03:22.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if I run that.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:22.800,00:03:25.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,Uh-oh.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:25.860,00:03:26.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,IP.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:27.520,00:03:27.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:29.100,00:03:30.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,MP here.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:30.240,00:03:30.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Thanks.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:32.460,00:03:33.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:33.340,00:03:33.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,It ran.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:34.880,00:03:39.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,And so my A, I think, is going to be, yeah, its dimension is reduced.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:40.160,00:03:47.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's no longer 406.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:47.420,00:03:52.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's reduced by 70, which is exactly the number of boundary grid points.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:53.640,00:03:55.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,And now if you plot the side.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:55.860,00:03:59.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you plot the side, you get the sum of A.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:59.100,00:04:00.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,It won't be zero anymore.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:00.620,00:04:04.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,It will be occasionally non-zero for.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:04.360,00:04:19.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you have any basis function that neighbors a boundary grid point, the summation won't be zero anymore.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:19.880,00:04:22.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:22.480,00:04:25.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's also.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:25.660,00:04:29.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,So plot the eigenvalues of A just to make sure we get.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:30.280,00:04:30.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:30.740,00:04:33.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the eigenvalues of A, they are positive.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:34.820,00:04:37.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you shouldn't get anything that is zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:37.640,00:04:37.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:37.880,00:04:38.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's good.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:38.540,00:04:40.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we get a positive definite matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:41.940,00:04:42.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Question so far?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:44.680,00:04:46.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Seems like it's working so far.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:48.020,00:04:49.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now we have the matrix A.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:49.840,00:04:54.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,The next step is to figure out the right-hand side.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:55.280,00:04:55.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So B.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:55.660,00:04:59.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is going to be the integral of the whole domain of phi.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:59.260,00:05:06.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have the integration of phiJ is equal to integral over the whole domain of phiJ times F.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:06.020,00:05:08.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we set our F is equal to 1 in this case.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:08.520,00:05:18.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it becomes the integral of phiJ dx.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:18.560,00:05:24.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Again, we split that up into into the elements.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:24.280,00:05:25.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's going to be integration of phiJ at the element k dx.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:25.280,00:05:33.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,integral is only non-zero in a small number of elements, right, 5 or 6. And on
Dialogue: 0,00:05:33.620,00:05:40.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,each element, phi j is a piecewise linear function. So on each element, let's say
Dialogue: 0,00:05:40.760,00:05:45.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,each element is, we have the triangle, the function is like that. So this is
Dialogue: 0,00:05:45.500,00:05:54.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,phi j, and we have x and y. So phi j is gonna be a linear function. If I draw
Dialogue: 0,00:05:54.240,00:06:00.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,the contours, it'll be like that. The integral of phi j over this triangle
Dialogue: 0,00:06:00.480,00:06:08.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,here is gonna be the volume of this tetrahedral, right. The height of this
Dialogue: 0,00:06:08.240,00:06:13.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,tetrahedral is equal to 1, the base is calculated as the area of the triangle.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:13.800,00:06:21.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is equal to what? The integral, which is the volume of the tetrahedral,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:21.120,00:06:24.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,is equal to what?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:24.240,00:06:35.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes. Yes, 1 third times the base, which is a k times the height, which is 1. Right, so
Dialogue: 0,00:06:35.040,00:06:42.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's a k over 3. Let's code it up here, a k over 3. The right-hand side is gonna be
Dialogue: 0,00:06:42.700,00:06:53.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,also 0 of m p 1, right, and after I compute the matrix, I compute the right-hand side.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:54.240,00:07:01.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the first is equal to a n divided by 3, with the configuration ofchts to be
Dialogue: 0,00:07:01.940,00:07:09.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,equal to m r logging over m-1 and the function that an & brings us to .
Dialogue: 0,00:07:09.180,00:07:17.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,For the value in the batch, we're gonna to meet the length of the bin a-1 and
Dialogue: 0,00:07:17.220,00:07:21.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,we want to avoid this. So the norm of the gradient space outside is about 1,b-1,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:21.020,00:07:24.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,and theối of the potatoes tells us how much it is, so each of them are equal to 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:24.120,00:07:31.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,the three basis functions on that triangle is going to be the same.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:31.060,00:07:34.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now we have a B, but the dimension of B is still too large.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:34.560,00:07:39.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,We need to remove also all the boundary points.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:39.400,00:07:42.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So B is going to be B interior.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:42.680,00:07:43.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:43.680,00:07:48.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's run this.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:48.220,00:07:51.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so that seems to work.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:51.120,00:07:54.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,We get an A 336 by 336.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:54.740,00:07:57.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,We get a B 336 by 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:57.600,00:08:04.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's also define a U. U would have to be covering...in order to visualize U, U has
Dialogue: 0,00:08:04.620,00:08:07.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,to be 0, MP, and 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:07.140,00:08:11.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,But then we're going to set U of interior to be the solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:11.620,00:08:16.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's going to be A backslash B. All right?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:16.420,00:08:20.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that gives me the solution, the height of the interior basis functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:20.880,00:08:21.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:21.120,00:08:26.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the boundaries are going to be left to be 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:26.580,00:08:31.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,So after this, let's run to see if that works.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:31.740,00:08:32.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oops.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:32.740,00:08:33.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,Zeros.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:33.740,00:08:36.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, that worked.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:36.520,00:08:46.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,We get a U. We get a U that is a bunch of zeros.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:46.360,00:08:47.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's probably boundary.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:47.360,00:08:49.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, we get a bunch of non-zeros.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:49.080,00:08:50.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's visualize that.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:51.120,00:08:55.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's use the twice serve again.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:55.940,00:09:02.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,We use the...T should be the same, this should be the same, and we just use U, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:02.740,00:09:07.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, that's our solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:07.600,00:09:16.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is our boundary, and we are just solving the Poisson's equation with the constant right-hand
Dialogue: 0,00:09:16.500,00:09:17.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,side.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:17.600,00:09:18.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,Which means the curvature...or the Laplace...
Dialogue: 0,00:09:18.660,00:09:19.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:19.660,00:09:20.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:20.660,00:09:24.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the Laplace-ing of the solution should be negative 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:24.220,00:09:25.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:25.220,00:09:30.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it bumps up the curvature in the x-direction plus the curvature in the y-direction should
Dialogue: 0,00:09:30.200,00:09:32.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,be equal to minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:32.840,00:09:38.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that's the solution we get for the two-dimensional Poisson's equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:38.060,00:09:40.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the boundaries are 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:40.280,00:09:41.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:41.280,00:09:49.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that completes our demo of what...how do we solve the...how do we use finite elements
Dialogue: 0,00:09:49.480,00:09:50.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,for...
Dialogue: 0,00:09:50.480,00:09:54.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,A two-dimensional problem.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:54.400,00:09:56.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any questions about the procedure?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:56.240,00:09:57.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:57.240,00:10:03.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,I thought you showed that shape like that's...
Dialogue: 0,00:10:03.240,00:10:07.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Something like 5 or 6 inches.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:07.240,00:10:08.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Mm-hmm.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:08.240,00:10:11.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Why was it not a triangle?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:11.040,00:10:12.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:12.200,00:10:16.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,So each triangle is shared by three basis functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:16.660,00:10:19.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,But each basis function doesn't neighbor only three triangles.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:19.040,00:10:20.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:20.040,00:10:29.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let me try to draw it.

Dialogue: 0,00:10:31.700,00:10:33.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,We have a triangle here.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:33.240,00:10:34.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we have a triangle here.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:34.580,00:10:37.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,For example, we have a triangle here.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:37.980,00:10:43.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,This basis function, if I draw the contours of that basis function, the basis function
Dialogue: 0,00:10:43.140,00:10:47.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,looks like that.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:47.340,00:10:48.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,The value of the basis function is 1 over here.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:48.960,00:10:49.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:49.960,00:10:50.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the contours look like that.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:50.960,00:10:51.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the contours look like that.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:51.960,00:11:03.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,I said it's 5 or 6 because the basis function is non-zero in this case in five elements,
