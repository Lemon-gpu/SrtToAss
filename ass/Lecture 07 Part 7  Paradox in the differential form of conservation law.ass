Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:08.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,I want to still make it more even more obvious that like do not use one of the
Dialogue: 0,00:00:08.180,00:00:14.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,differential forms when you have shock waves okay so so we just compute the
Dialogue: 0,00:00:14.880,00:00:23.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,speed of the shock wave to be essentially FL minus fu so this is FL is
Dialogue: 0,00:00:23.580,00:00:33.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,f of ul fu is f of f if you are so this is ul minus you are right so so instead
Dialogue: 0,00:00:33.180,00:00:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,of D F D U this is Delta F over Delta U
Dialogue: 0,00:00:42.580,00:00:48.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,and so let's try it on the burgers equation we already know that on the
Dialogue: 0,00:00:48.480,00:00:51.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,burgers equation
Dialogue: 0,00:00:53.580,00:00:59.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,we have the speed of the shock wave being ul plus you are over 2 right so
Dialogue: 0,00:00:59.500,00:01:07.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,that's what we derived but there is a contradiction here if we multiply both
Dialogue: 0,00:01:07.880,00:01:17.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,sides of the equation by U and Monday and many manipulate using your calculus
Dialogue: 0,00:01:17.580,00:01:22.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,skills we can get something pretty interesting
Dialogue: 0,00:01:22.420,00:01:23.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,so let's try it again.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:23.580,00:01:31.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,So first of all, the time derivative term, there is a classical trick that actually is
Dialogue: 0,00:01:31.740,00:01:36.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,very useful in stability analysis, they call nonlinear stability analysis of differential
Dialogue: 0,00:01:36.400,00:01:44.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,equations, that when you multiply u with du dt, it is actually equal to partial t of u
Dialogue: 0,00:01:44.960,00:01:50.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,squared over 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:50.200,00:01:56.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the same kind of chain rule we use to go back and forth between the differential,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:56.560,00:02:01.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,between the primitive form and conservative form of the Berger's equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:01.840,00:02:11.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,There is a similar trick you can use on the spatial derivative term.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:11.040,00:02:20.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,u times du squared over dx squared is equal to something times du squared over dx squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:20.180,00:02:25.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,du cubed over dx.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:25.060,00:02:28.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that's something, let me derive it.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:28.040,00:02:46.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,So du cubed dx is equal to the derivative of u times u squared over dx.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:46.220,00:02:47.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,And now you expand it.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:47.500,00:02:48.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is equal to u times dx.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:48.520,00:02:49.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then you multiply that by the derivative of u times u squared over dx squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:49.720,00:02:49.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you expand it.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:49.820,00:02:50.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,You can do it once again.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:50.020,00:02:50.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then we're going to do the same thing.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:50.060,00:02:50.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now that we've done this exercise, we're going to do the same thing.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:50.160,00:03:06.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,u squared dx plus u squared times du dx and the same thing can be represented as
Dialogue: 0,00:03:06.800,00:03:19.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,derivative of u times u times u which can be represented as u squared times du
Dialogue: 0,00:03:19.080,00:03:29.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,dx times 3 right so you can move one of the u out move the you can move this u
Dialogue: 0,00:03:29.960,00:03:35.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,you can move this times this out of the differential and you can move this and
Dialogue: 0,00:03:35.620,00:03:37.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,this out of the differential and you can move this and this out of the
Dialogue: 0,00:03:37.980,00:03:44.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,differential so that that like works like that so so the same so the same
Dialogue: 0,00:03:44.360,00:03:48.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,thing is equal to 3 times this or it is
Dialogue: 0,00:03:48.880,00:03:48.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,again enseñ statistik Geschichte und volume um gesehen um so if you can see
Dialogue: 0,00:03:48.980,00:03:57.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,equal to this plus this. Okay so let me let me do a derivation. So u squared
Dialogue: 0,00:03:57.680,00:04:03.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,times partial u partial x is going to be equal to one third of partial u cubed
Dialogue: 0,00:04:03.480,00:04:09.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,partial x. And now we substitute this into that we get partial u cubed
Dialogue: 0,00:04:09.920,00:04:15.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,partial x is equal to u times partial u squared partial x plus one third of
Dialogue: 0,00:04:15.920,00:04:22.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,partial u cubed partial x which means u times partial u squared partial x is
Dialogue: 0,00:04:22.420,00:04:34.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,equal to two-third of partial u cubed partial x. So this is going to be two
Dialogue: 0,00:04:34.580,00:04:45.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,third. So this is the whole derivation of this. Right okay so with
Dialogue: 0,00:04:45.860,00:04:45.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,this we can do the derivation. So we can do the derivation of this. So we can do the derivation of this. Right okay so with
Dialogue: 0,00:04:45.900,00:04:53.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,this two substituted into this equation what we have and of course we have over
Dialogue: 0,00:04:53.300,00:05:01.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,two here so this is going to be a one-third if we divide by two here. So
Dialogue: 0,00:05:01.420,00:05:10.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,this equation therefore becomes partial partial t of half u square plus partial
Dialogue: 0,00:05:10.380,00:05:15.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,partial x of a third of u cubed equal to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:15.840,00:05:19.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right, so those two are one third of partial u squared partial x plus one and
Dialogue: 0,00:05:19.400,00:05:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,that is u squared is equal to partial t over two. So we have to Pass more Kanad yes
Dialogue: 0,00:05:22.000,00:05:22.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,but we have
Dialogue: 0,00:05:22.220,00:05:27.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,so we have the S grilling out of the logic bag then the other side too this
Dialogue: 0,00:05:27.140,00:05:32.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,is called parallel values and we given a slight one this S g going to be
Dialogue: 0,00:05:32.180,00:05:35.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,partial t but yes also called partial t times partial t so the Brock equation
Dialogue: 0,00:05:35.340,00:05:40.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,here in because there's a three times partial here so now we can see it and
Dialogue: 0,00:05:40.720,00:05:41.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,that we decrease the mean by sin you oyster.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:41.980,00:05:43.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,We actually want to be
Dialogue: 0,00:05:43.620,00:05:45.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,You enidious know that bitch answer how to which far so understand when I'material
Dialogue: 0,00:05:45.520,00:05:49.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,3 half power divided by 3.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:50.420,00:05:51.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:55.500,00:06:00.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is nothing but writing the same equation,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:00.300,00:06:03.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Berger's equation, into a different form
Dialogue: 0,00:06:03.080,00:06:08.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,by doing a bunch of manipulations of the derivatives.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:08.200,00:06:16.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,But with that alternative way of writing down the conservation law,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:16.480,00:06:18.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,we have a different shock speed.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:19.580,00:06:27.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,The shock speed in this case is going to be equal to delta FV over delta V.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:27.940,00:06:34.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's going to be equal to delta of this 2V,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:35.260,00:06:37.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,3 over 2 over 3,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:37.500,00:06:38.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,divided by 2V,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:38.180,00:06:39.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,divided by delta V,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:41.900,00:06:48.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is different from half of UL plus UR.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:50.600,00:06:57.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So these two only agree when UL and UR are infinitesimally close to each other,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:57.620,00:07:01.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,and they don't agree over a finite range of UL and UR.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:04.620,00:07:07.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's not obvious, but you can do the derivation and see that.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:08.180,00:07:11.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what does that mean is,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:13.940,00:07:15.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,what does that mean is,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:16.060,00:07:19.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,all this derivation we did down here
Dialogue: 0,00:07:19.100,00:07:27.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,only hold over an infinitesimal range UL and UR.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:28.520,00:07:32.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,All the derivation we did only holds for the differential form of the equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:32.700,00:07:36.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,It does not hold for the conservative form,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:36.240,00:07:37.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,for the integral form of the equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:38.180,00:07:41.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So when you choose a discretization,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:42.220,00:07:45.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,we can never base the discretization
Dialogue: 0,00:07:45.120,00:07:48.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,on some differential manipulation.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:49.160,00:07:50.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,For example, the Taylor series.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:52.200,00:07:52.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:53.180,00:07:57.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,The Taylor series is a manipulation of the differential form of the equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:58.220,00:08:02.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that is no longer a reliable way of
Dialogue: 0,00:08:02.660,00:08:06.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,manipulating the differential equation into another form to solve it.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:06.280,00:08:06.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:06.320,00:08:10.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,We should rely on something else.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:13.240,00:08:17.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this lecture, I'm just going to show you what that something else is.
