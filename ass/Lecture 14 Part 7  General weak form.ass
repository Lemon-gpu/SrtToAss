Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:09.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the weak form in general, we only did the weak form for Poisson's equation, but there are also weak forms for many other equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:09.800,00:00:15.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in general, the weak form contains two elements. One element is what's called a bilinear form.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:15.840,00:00:24.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we write it as a of u and v.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:25.960,00:00:39.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,So an example of the bilinear form we have before is minus integration of a to b, the derivative of x times the derivative of v.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:39.940,00:00:43.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,It is equal to...

Dialogue: 0,00:00:46.080,00:00:47.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,Bilinear form.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:48.280,00:00:51.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,It has to satisfy a certain number of criteria.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:51.780,00:01:14.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,First of all, a times any c1 times u1 plus c2 times u2, v has to be equal to c1 times a of u1, v plus c2 times u2, v.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:14.020,00:01:15.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is simply...
Dialogue: 0,00:01:15.840,00:01:17.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is simply a linearity in the first argument.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:17.840,00:01:24.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,It also has to satisfy a similar linearity in the second argument.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:29.340,00:01:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's equal to c1 times a of u, v1 plus c2, there is an a here, a, u, and v2.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:41.540,00:01:41.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:41.840,00:01:41.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:44.100,00:01:45.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the standard.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:45.760,00:01:45.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the standard.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:45.820,00:01:50.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,definition of what is linear and the reason it's called bilinear is that
Dialogue: 0,00:01:50.980,00:01:57.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,because it is linear with respect to both its arguments. In this example it's
Dialogue: 0,00:01:57.100,00:02:01.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,pretty clear why each of them are linear. If you perform linear combination
Dialogue: 0,00:02:01.900,00:02:05.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,of u, you can pull these linear combination coefficients out of the
Dialogue: 0,00:02:05.640,00:02:10.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,integral. Alternatively, if you perform any linear combination of v,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:10.200,00:02:13.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,you can also pull these linear combination coefficients out of the
Dialogue: 0,00:02:13.440,00:02:20.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,integral. And in our example this bilinearform has a particularly nice
Dialogue: 0,00:02:20.040,00:02:25.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,property. It's symmetrical, right, so if we exchange u and v in these two
Dialogue: 0,00:02:25.620,00:02:32.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,arguments, the value doesn't change. And this, if you remember, has
Dialogue: 0,00:02:32.360,00:02:38.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,an intimate relationship with the symmetry of the matrix A we got out of
Dialogue: 0,00:02:38.060,00:02:42.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,discretizing using finite element. okay but
Dialogue: 0,00:02:42.260,00:02:43.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,But like this, it's only vodka.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:43.220,00:02:43.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this one is also a complete example. mentions and use to each idle.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:43.400,00:02:53.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,for other equations, for example, if we have odd derivatives in the equation, in the differential
Dialogue: 0,00:02:53.320,00:02:57.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,equation, then the bilinear form we're going to get is no longer going to be symmetric.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:58.320,00:03:05.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, the other element we need in defining the weak form is a linear functional.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:05.540,00:03:13.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,We call it L of v.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:14.220,00:03:23.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,So L of v, in our previous example, we have this integration of f times v dx is equal
Dialogue: 0,00:03:23.800,00:03:24.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,to our L of v.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:26.760,00:03:31.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,So L of v has a single argument because f is predefined.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:31.880,00:03:34.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,f is a known function, is a given known function.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:34.780,00:03:35.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,So L of v is a single argument because f is predefined.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:35.520,00:03:35.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So L of v has a single argument because f is predefined.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:35.540,00:03:48.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,So another example of a linear functional is L of v simply equal to v at 0.5, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:48.560,00:03:51.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Our previous example of like when f is a delta function.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:52.880,00:03:54.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's also a linear functional.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:56.380,00:04:03.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,The linear functional has to satisfy a very similar criterion as the bilinear form.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:03.140,00:04:05.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,It has to satisfy L.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:05.320,00:04:16.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,So L of c1 v1 plus c2 v2 has to equal to c1 times L of v1 plus c2 L of v2.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:17.720,00:04:20.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's why it's called a linear functional.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:21.080,00:04:26.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, once we define the bilinear form and the linear functional, the weak form
Dialogue: 0,00:04:26.100,00:04:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,also requires a space.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:34.000,00:04:35.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,So actually,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:35.280,00:04:39.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,the bilinear form and linear functional, they both require a certain space.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:39.120,00:04:43.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,So u and v are in a certain space.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:44.340,00:04:47.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is v in a certain linear space.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:47.920,00:04:49.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean, they should have a...
Dialogue: 0,00:04:51.060,00:04:55.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,In the simplest form of finite element, the u and v should be in the same space.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:55.400,00:04:57.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then we've got what's called a Galerkin method.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:58.720,00:05:04.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,And in more advanced treatments, u and v can belong to different linear spaces.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:04.060,00:05:15.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,But no matter what you do, the v in the bilinear form and the L in the linear functional has to be in the same linear space.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:16.460,00:05:22.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the weak form is to find u within x.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:23.080,00:05:30.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's actually make it clear, make it more general by saying that u is in a certain x u.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:30.920,00:05:32.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is in x v.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:32.460,00:05:33.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is in x v.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:34.060,00:05:50.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,So find u in x u such that a u v plus L of v equal to zero for any v in this space x v.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:50.380,00:06:02.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,And a special case is u...
Dialogue: 0,00:06:02.380,00:06:04.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's x u.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:04.060,00:06:05.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's x u is equal to x v.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:06.260,00:06:08.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's called a Galerkin method.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:12.340,00:06:18.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well, Galerkin method also requires the space of x u and x v to be the same.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:19.220,00:06:24.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we are also discretizing x u and x v in the same way.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:25.380,00:06:29.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,When we go from this infinite dimensional space to a finite dimensional space,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:29.740,00:06:33.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,we are also selecting the basis.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:34.060,00:06:35.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is also in the same way.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:36.500,00:06:37.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:38.340,00:06:44.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is a general form of the weak form of differential equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:45.460,00:06:53.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,And for a lot of differential equations out there, we can find this kind of weak forms that represent the differential equation,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:53.080,00:07:03.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,but gives more general solutions, even if the right-hand side of the differential equation or some coefficients in the differential equation is no longer well-defined functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:04.060,00:07:05.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:05.180,00:07:09.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,An example I can give is the following.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:09.140,00:07:14.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,An example I can give is in structural mechanics,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:14.580,00:07:23.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,people often solve some kind of equations for structural elements like a beam.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:24.580,00:07:26.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the simplest form of...
Dialogue: 0,00:07:26.260,00:07:29.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Basically, all the beam equations involve fourth-order derivatives.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:29.280,00:07:32.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,But the simplest beam equation, the Euler beam equation,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:32.800,00:07:36.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,has a form like that.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:36.200,00:07:41.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the fourth-order derivative of the solution plus f is equal to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:41.920,00:07:52.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,And here, u describes the bending of a beam, and f is the loading on the beam.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:52.920,00:07:59.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So f and u is the...
Dialogue: 0,00:07:59.120,00:08:00.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,f is loading.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:00.240,00:08:01.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,And u is the...
Dialogue: 0,00:08:01.080,00:08:01.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So f is loading.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:01.240,00:08:02.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,And u is the...
Dialogue: 0,00:08:02.280,00:08:02.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,And u is the...
Dialogue: 0,00:08:02.440,00:08:02.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,And u is the...
Dialogue: 0,00:08:02.680,00:08:02.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,And u is the...
Dialogue: 0,00:08:02.800,00:08:04.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,And u is deflection.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:07.160,00:08:08.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:09.060,00:08:09.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,So...
Dialogue: 0,00:08:09.800,00:08:12.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,And...
Dialogue: 0,00:08:13.460,00:08:20.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,We can derive the weak form again by multiplying a test function u
Dialogue: 0,00:08:20.060,00:08:24.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,on this equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:26.640,00:08:31.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's say this is a, this is b, dx is equal to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:31.140,00:08:37.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,And because u involves a fourth-order derivative, we need more comprehensive boundary conditions
Dialogue: 0,00:08:37.700,00:08:40.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,than what we have for the Poisson's equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:40.820,00:08:44.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the boundary condition for the beam can be a simple support can be clamped.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:44.900,00:08:50.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,A simple support means the value of u has to be a certain value, which means the position
Dialogue: 0,00:08:50.480,00:08:52.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,has to be fixed.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:52.640,00:08:58.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,And also, it has no bending moments, which means the second-order derivative of u has
Dialogue: 0,00:08:58.440,00:08:59.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,to be zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:59.440,00:09:00.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean, second-order derivative is like...
Dialogue: 0,00:09:00.500,00:09:03.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Second-order derivative is like the curvature.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:03.040,00:09:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or it can be clamped, which means the first-order and...
Dialogue: 0,00:09:06.000,00:09:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The u and the first-order derivative has to be zero, which means, like, the slope has
Dialogue: 0,00:09:10.000,00:09:11.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,to be fixed.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:11.000,00:09:21.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, so let's, let's, for example, give a used example of u and u derivative both equal
Dialogue: 0,00:09:21.140,00:09:25.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,to zero at zero and one, or at a and b.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:25.340,00:09:30.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then, during the integration by parts...
Dialogue: 0,00:09:30.380,00:09:41.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so, so if we have this, of course, when we define a u , u also has to satisfy,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:41.380,00:09:50.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,satisfy these boundary conditions.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:50.380,00:09:54.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, and, and then what, what is u ?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:54.880,00:09:57.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,u is going to be...
Dialogue: 0,00:09:57.380,00:09:59.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, x u, sorry.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:59.380,00:10:00.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,x u is...
Dialogue: 0,00:10:00.380,00:10:08.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,x u is actually the Sobolev space in between a and b of two, because in this case, u is
Dialogue: 0,00:10:08.980,00:10:11.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,taking a fourth-order derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:11.780,00:10:17.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,And when we derive the Sobolev space, we're going to find out that although we won't require
Dialogue: 0,00:10:17.940,00:10:22.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,that the solution and the test function to have a fourth-order derivative, but they need
Dialogue: 0,00:10:22.160,00:10:24.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,to have a second-order derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:24.880,00:10:25.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:25.880,00:10:29.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, what we're going to get over here is that...
Dialogue: 0,00:10:29.380,00:10:36.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,We integrate by parts once, so a and b, v of fourth derivative of x.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:36.380,00:10:45.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,If we integrate by, by parts once, we get a minus sign, we get a derivative of v, and
Dialogue: 0,00:10:45.380,00:10:49.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,we get a third-order derivative of u.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:49.380,00:10:56.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we integrate by parts twice, the negative sign is gone again, and we have a second-order
Dialogue: 0,00:10:56.380,00:10:57.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,derivative of v and a second-order derivative of u.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:57.380,00:10:58.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:58.380,00:11:00.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, we have the может if y equal to plane distance.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:00.320,00:11:06.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is going to be a product of the first-order derivative of u.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:06.040,00:11:10.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, let me maybe give you a little bit more of a sense of the meaning, of физene usually.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:10.660,00:11:12.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is our assertion in here.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:12.020,00:11:13.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,We have a product of u.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:13.580,00:11:18.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, we're going to use this condition.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:18.260,00:11:26.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we'll take our position of becomes theets and that's the solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:26.540,00:11:27.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:28.380,00:11:36.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,and what is our linear functional it's gonna be the same right integration of
Dialogue: 0,00:11:36.500,00:11:49.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,V and F so that completes our derivation of the weak form so the ingredients of
Dialogue: 0,00:11:49.340,00:11:54.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,the weak form first of all we need to define the space of the solution and the
Dialogue: 0,00:11:54.760,00:12:00.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,test function in this case both can be H2 we also need to define a bilinear
Dialogue: 0,00:12:00.580,00:12:05.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,form in this case the product of the second derivatives we need to define a
Dialogue: 0,00:12:05.080,00:12:11.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,linear functional in this case the product of the test function V with the
Dialogue: 0,00:12:11.080,00:12:20.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,known function F okay and we can use find elements to solve this we can
Dialogue: 0,00:12:20.620,00:12:24.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,construct a in this case we are going to notice that
Dialogue: 0,00:12:24.600,00:12:24.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,P is the same as the test function so we need to define the product of the second
Dialogue: 0,00:12:24.740,00:12:28.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,derivative and of course to use a bilinear function the Appозiter will
Dialogue: 0,00:12:28.220,00:12:31.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,stop the math so we are going to Chinese easily爽z Professor
Dialogue: 0,00:12:31.720,00:12:50.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,so,Where do you replace with this tableни에 f
Dialogue: 0,00:12:51.420,00:12:54.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,so,We need to free hey
Dialogue: 0,00:12:54.660,00:12:57.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,we are going to solve the same matrix equation,
Dialogue: 0,00:12:57.960,00:12:59.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,A U equal to B,
Dialogue: 0,00:12:59.960,00:13:02.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,to get the linear combination coefficients
Dialogue: 0,00:13:02.800,00:13:07.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,of these piecewise quadratic basis functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:07.060,00:13:10.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then the solution has to be reconstructed
Dialogue: 0,00:13:10.340,00:13:12.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,using the linear combination coefficients
Dialogue: 0,00:13:12.960,00:13:15.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,on these piecewise quadratic basis functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:17.180,00:13:18.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:18.820,00:13:20.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is just another example
Dialogue: 0,00:13:20.600,00:13:23.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,of what the weak form can be for other equations.
