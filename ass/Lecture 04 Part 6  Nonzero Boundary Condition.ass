Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:03.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, the question is, if I have non-zero boundary conditions, what do I do?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:05.280,00:00:12.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's just take an exercise and put the same function and make, let's say, the boundary
Dialogue: 0,00:00:12.380,00:00:14.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,condition to be non-zero on one of the sides.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:15.020,00:00:15.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,Which side do you want?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:19.240,00:00:20.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,X equal to zero side?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:21.000,00:00:21.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:22.080,00:00:24.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's first go back to our whiteboard.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:24.820,00:00:35.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,But if at x equal to zero, which means r equal to zero, the u is something, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:35.700,00:00:47.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's, for example, u of zero j is given and not zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:48.140,00:00:48.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:49.900,00:00:52.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,How does it affect our equation?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:54.460,00:00:54.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,So.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:54.820,00:00:59.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it affects our equation only for i equal to one, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:00.300,00:01:00.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:00.640,00:01:05.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because all the other cases, so we have given solution here.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:05.760,00:01:07.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,We have given solution here.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:08.240,00:01:12.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,It only is included in the discretization of i equal to one.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:13.580,00:01:20.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we only need to consider changes in the first n y minus one rows of this matrix equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:22.480,00:01:24.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,And because this is given.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:24.560,00:01:24.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:24.820,00:01:25.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because these numbers are given.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:27.000,00:01:31.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,We should actually be moving these numbers to the right-hand side of the equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:31.320,00:01:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because it's known.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:32.120,00:01:32.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's not part of the unknown.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:33.140,00:01:34.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's not a linear combination of the unknowns.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:35.680,00:01:39.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,So moving to the right-hand side of the equation is this term.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:40.640,00:01:42.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,Should be moved to here.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:42.380,00:01:48.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's minus of u zero j divided by delta x squared.

Dialogue: 0,00:01:51.860,00:01:53.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's do that.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:54.300,00:01:54.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:54.820,00:01:56.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what I get would be.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:57.320,00:02:00.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's use another color to be sure.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:02.540,00:02:05.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,What we get is a minus here.

Dialogue: 0,00:02:17.200,00:02:21.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,And minus u of zero and y minus one divided by delta x squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:21.900,00:02:23.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's going to be our bonding condition.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:23.440,00:02:29.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what kind of u would you like to see here?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:32.480,00:02:36.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's say u x zero is equal to.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:36.940,00:02:36.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,Huh?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:37.840,00:02:38.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,One.

Dialogue: 0,00:02:39.680,00:02:39.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:40.680,00:02:46.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it should be ones of n y minus one one.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:46.280,00:02:46.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:46.500,00:02:48.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's what we.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:48.420,00:02:50.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's the length of the vector we have.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:53.440,00:02:57.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what I should do is my f is equal to f.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:58.400,00:02:59.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Not f.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:59.480,00:03:02.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,But f from one to n y minus one.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:02.480,00:03:05.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Should be equal to the existing f.

Dialogue: 0,00:06:10.220,00:06:19.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,adding, right? So it goes all the way to here. And let's count how many do we have.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:20.120,00:06:28.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in the first block, in every block, we have n1 minus 1 of this 1 over delta x squared.

Dialogue: 0,00:10:36.920,00:10:38.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I think I understand what you mean.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:38.920,00:10:41.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,You see in some part of the domain,

Dialogue: 0,00:10:44.920,00:10:46.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's take a look at that also.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:47.920,00:10:51.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So where was that?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:51.920,00:10:55.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,OK, so I constructed ux0 f and solve that again

Dialogue: 0,00:10:59.920,00:11:03.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Wait, this.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:03.920,00:11:06.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right, so this is what we have.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:06.920,00:11:09.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,And you're asking, are you asking this part of the?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:09.920,00:11:10.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:10.920,00:11:16.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,It looks like it has a negative curvature in this direction.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:16.920,00:11:17.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,OK.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:17.920,00:11:18.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's a positive curvature in this direction.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:18.920,00:11:19.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:19.920,00:11:24.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,But if you rotate it, it seems to also have a positive curvature
Dialogue: 0,00:11:24.920,00:11:26.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,in the x direction.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:26.920,00:11:27.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:27.920,00:11:30.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the Laplace thing is actually the curvature in the x direction
Dialogue: 0,00:11:30.920,00:11:33.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,plus the curvature in the y direction.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:33.920,00:11:37.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if you remember in here, when you get x close to 0,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:37.920,00:11:40.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,the curvature is sine x times cosine y.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:40.920,00:11:41.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Sine x is almost 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:41.920,00:11:43.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the curvature is almost 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:43.920,00:11:46.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,That means your x curvature and y curvature is the same.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:46.920,00:11:51.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,And y curvature is supposed to cancel out each other pretty much.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:51.920,00:11:52.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:52.920,00:11:55.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in order for the function to make up
Dialogue: 0,00:11:55.920,00:11:57.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,to the boundary condition of 1, it
Dialogue: 0,00:11:57.920,00:11:59.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,needs to have a strong x curvature, which
Dialogue: 0,00:11:59.920,00:12:04.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,means you need a negative y curvature to compensate.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:04.920,00:12:06.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Sure.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:06.920,00:12:08.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we have a look at f.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:08.920,00:12:12.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, can you take a look at f again?
Dialogue: 0,00:12:12.920,00:12:14.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Figure of f.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:16.920,00:12:19.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's f.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:19.920,00:12:22.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,At x close to 0, you get almost 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:22.920,00:12:23.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:12:23.920,00:12:27.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,I don't mean f.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:27.920,00:12:32.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean the new right-hand side.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:32.920,00:12:37.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, the new right-hand side.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:37.920,00:12:39.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,It means small f?
Dialogue: 0,00:12:39.920,00:12:40.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:40.920,00:12:42.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Small f is one dimensional.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:42.920,00:12:43.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I can plot small f.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:43.920,00:12:45.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,But it'll be something like that.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:45.920,00:12:50.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So small f for the first block is very, very negative
Dialogue: 0,00:12:50.920,00:12:52.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,because of the boundary condition.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:52.920,00:12:53.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:12:53.920,00:12:56.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this part is different from all the rest.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:56.920,00:13:00.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,All the rest actually looks pretty much 0 compared to that.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:00.920,00:13:03.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,But I'm sure they are not really 0.

Dialogue: 0,00:13:06.920,00:13:09.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,But it has much less magnitude than the first block
Dialogue: 0,00:13:09.920,00:13:14.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,due to the boundary condition.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:14.920,00:13:15.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah?
Dialogue: 0,00:13:15.920,00:13:20.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So just to be more general, should we also include the points at the boundary

Dialogue: 0,00:13:23.920,00:13:26.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So should you include the points at the boundary

Dialogue: 0,00:13:29.920,00:13:34.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,which makes the boundary points also unknown,
Dialogue: 0,00:13:34.920,00:13:37.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,it is appropriate to include the boundary points also as unknowns.

Dialogue: 0,00:13:40.920,00:13:43.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you need to distinguish what is known, what is unknown
