Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:07.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,One second. Yep, back to the presentation. So far we solved a very easy linear single physics problem.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:08.440,00:00:12.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,So next thing we're going to introduce the second physics by right-clicking on component 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:12.880,00:00:17.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,The entire thing is called a model, and if you save it, it's called a .mph, the multi-physics file.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:18.460,00:00:23.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right now we have one component, but you could actually right-click on the root, add more components,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:23.580,00:00:28.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the second component can be any dimension. It doesn't have to be the same as the first component.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:28.260,00:00:33.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,The use of that, I can think of one, for example, if you have a laser heating problem.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:33.260,00:00:40.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,You have a block of materials, a 3D coffee mug like this, and laser cutting it from the top cover,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:40.260,00:00:45.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the laser penetrates a certain depth. So what I'm actually curious about laser heating is
Dialogue: 0,00:00:45.260,00:00:49.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,how the heat distribution is going to be like through the depths in the 1D.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:49.260,00:00:56.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I could solve that 1D heat, for example, a Gaussian curve or something, distribution across the z direction,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:56.260,00:00:58.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then the 3D actual heat distribution.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:58.260,00:01:02.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I could have actual heat conduction, convection, radiation in the 3D mug.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:02.260,00:01:09.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that way I could have a 1D component coupled with a 3D component instead of solving everything in 3D.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:09.260,00:01:13.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right, and then within each of the components, you could have any number of physics.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:13.260,00:01:16.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, so far we have one. We could add a second one.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:16.260,00:01:21.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Sometimes you could grab a whole bunch of physics from the very first step when they interact with the model wizard.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:21.260,00:01:27.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm just showing how the workflow and I want you to understand each physics correctly before we move on to the next one.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:27.260,00:01:29.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm doing it one by one.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:29.260,00:01:32.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the second physics I'm going to choose is a heat transfer physics.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:32.260,00:01:36.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's on the heat transfer folder called heat transferring solid.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:36.260,00:01:40.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Again, I right click, add it to the component.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:40.260,00:01:44.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then I could close the physics panel here.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:44.260,00:01:46.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the second physics is added here.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:46.260,00:01:50.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,As I mentioned, the sequence of physics doesn't matter, so you can actually drag them around.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:50.260,00:01:52.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,You could pretty much drag everything around.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:52.260,00:01:56.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,For example, the binary condition sequences, but you need to pay more attention to that one.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:56.260,00:01:59.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,You know, make sure it's the correct settings.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:59.260,00:02:02.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is what I mentioned is the same workflow for any physics.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:02.260,00:02:05.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you work with the actual currents. You know how it's like.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:05.260,00:02:07.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now you look at heat transferring solids.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:07.260,00:02:12.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,You have the same three D4 nodes, a domain condition, a boundary condition, and an initial value.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:12.260,00:02:18.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the domain condition is the, you know, some conduction equation, the Poisson equation here.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:18.260,00:02:22.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then a boundary condition D4 is thermal insulation everywhere.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:22.260,00:02:24.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we know we're going to replace some of that.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:24.260,00:02:26.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to right click on heat transfer.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:26.260,00:02:31.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,When I case the heat transfer Ukrainies solid at first of all heat source, remember we have a heat source fromley
Dialogue: 0,00:02:31.260,00:02:32.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,80.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:32.260,00:02:34.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Coming from air current and physics.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:34.260,00:02:39.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to assign the volumetric heat source to the entire domain once everywhere in domain one.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:39.260,00:02:47.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Have this key source and what's the amount of the source you can either use to drop down comes to a smart enough to know DAD's you have.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:47.260,00:02:48.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Curve physics.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:48.260,00:02:49.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,You have a heat transfer.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:49.260,00:02:51.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,You probably want to do this.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:51.260,00:02:55.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,The electromagnetic heating is a volumetric heat source, or you could type in the variable that you can look up.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:55.260,00:02:56.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,OK.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:56.260,00:03:00.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,either through, there's two ways of looking inside of
Dialogue: 0,00:03:00.500,00:03:04.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,COMSOL variables, what are the internal variables that's being used. One is to
Dialogue: 0,00:03:04.500,00:03:08.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,toggle on the equation view by clicking on the eye icon here. Then each of
Dialogue: 0,00:03:08.580,00:03:12.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,the physics nodes you could actually expand. Then for example, if we
Dialogue: 0,00:03:12.540,00:03:16.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,go back to electric currents, the current conservation here, all the internal
Dialogue: 0,00:03:16.360,00:03:20.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,variables with descriptions are listed here. And I already know that it's
Dialogue: 0,00:03:20.280,00:03:24.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,ec.qrh, that is the volumetric heat source
Dialogue: 0,00:03:24.460,00:03:28.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,I want to type in. So I could type that here, ec.qrh.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:28.460,00:03:32.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that will be
Dialogue: 0,00:03:32.460,00:03:36.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,essentially the same. Or if I want a certain magnitude of that, I could write
Dialogue: 0,00:03:36.460,00:03:40.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,the expression based on ec.qrh as well. So anything you want.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:40.460,00:03:44.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,And what else I want to say. So the
Dialogue: 0,00:03:44.460,00:03:48.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,variables can also be found through the post processing steps.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:48.460,00:03:52.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for example, you could actually add a complete report, write a report
Dialogue: 0,00:03:52.460,00:03:54.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,in the HTML format or a web format, and then you could actually
Dialogue: 0,00:03:54.460,00:03:58.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,add a document format. You'll have all the information of the internal
Dialogue: 0,00:03:58.460,00:04:02.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,equations from different physics and the expressions and the units
Dialogue: 0,00:04:02.460,00:04:06.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,and everything. So that's another way of looking at those information.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:06.460,00:04:10.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,Going back to the heat transfer physics, so
Dialogue: 0,00:04:10.460,00:04:14.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,we define a heat source. The other things we want to do is change the
Dialogue: 0,00:04:14.460,00:04:18.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,default boundary conditions. So I could right click, add a
Dialogue: 0,00:04:18.460,00:04:22.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,heat flux condition. I'll grab all boundaries.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:22.460,00:04:26.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the drop down has all boundaries. And say it's a convective heat flux
Dialogue: 0,00:04:26.460,00:04:30.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,with a heat transfer coefficient of 5, the handbook value.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:30.460,00:04:34.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the external temperature, just the room temperature, 20 degrees C.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:34.460,00:04:38.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then I'm going to choose
Dialogue: 0,00:04:38.460,00:04:42.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,a fixed temperature condition on surface number 1 and 10.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:42.460,00:04:46.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm going to make a selection out of these two, call them the feet.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:46.460,00:04:50.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So later on if I want to refer to both boundaries, I could just use the
Dialogue: 0,00:04:50.460,00:04:54.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,drop down to choose feet instead of finding those boundaries again.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:54.460,00:04:58.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,Sometimes we see customers, especially industrial level models with thousands of surfaces,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:58.460,00:05:02.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,then it's almost necessary, very necessary to group the
Dialogue: 0,00:05:02.460,00:05:06.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,surfaces and that'll help with the
Dialogue: 0,00:05:06.460,00:05:10.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,workflow a lot. So the two is going to
Dialogue: 0,00:05:10.460,00:05:14.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,glue to the heat sink, so it's going to be fixed at room temperature also.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:14.460,00:05:18.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that fixed temperature condition will replace the heat flux condition here.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:18.460,00:05:20.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,Another thing that we want to do is change the heat transfer coefficient.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:20.460,00:05:24.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,Another way of coupling these two is through the multi-physics node.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:24.460,00:05:28.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have basically a central place to control those types of
Dialogue: 0,00:05:28.460,00:05:32.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,coupling through the multi-physics node.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:32.460,00:05:36.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,Depending on the two physics you have added so far, you could have
Dialogue: 0,00:05:36.460,00:05:40.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,potentially electromagnetic heating, which is the dual heating. You could have
Dialogue: 0,00:05:40.460,00:05:44.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,thermal electric effects, and you could have boundary
Dialogue: 0,00:05:44.460,00:05:48.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,effects and also discharge heat source.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:48.460,00:05:50.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So some kind of a heat transfer coefficient.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:50.460,00:05:54.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then you could add the plasma effect as well.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:54.460,00:05:58.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the DC plasma.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:58.460,00:06:02.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So basically you can, instead of adding the heat flux under the physics node
Dialogue: 0,00:06:02.460,00:06:06.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,of heat transfer, you could add that in the global sense here by just
Dialogue: 0,00:06:06.460,00:06:10.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,adding the electromagnetics assigned to domain one. So those two would be essentially
Dialogue: 0,00:06:10.460,00:06:14.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,equivalent. You could disable just one of them.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:14.460,00:06:18.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,And yeah, the mesh should still be good. Now the stationary step will be solved
Dialogue: 0,00:06:18.460,00:06:22.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,by adding the heat transfer coefficient.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:22.460,00:06:26.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to right click on study, hit compute again.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:26.460,00:06:30.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the progress actually shows you how many iterations and what's the
Dialogue: 0,00:06:30.460,00:06:34.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,error estimate. And now it gives you the solution very quickly.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:34.460,00:06:38.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to add a new plot group. You could change the previous
Dialogue: 0,00:06:38.460,00:06:42.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,one as well. And I'm going to add a surface
Dialogue: 0,00:06:42.460,00:06:46.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,plot of temperature, which is uppercase T.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:46.460,00:06:50.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then you could also use the replace expression here.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:50.460,00:06:54.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,A better color for thermal, I usually like the thermal light.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:54.460,00:06:58.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, I choose the wireframe. Let me disable that.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:58.460,00:07:02.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So basically the coldest part is the feet.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:02.460,00:07:06.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then the hottest spot is right here in the middle of the beam.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:06.460,00:07:10.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's it for the heat transfer physics. Any questions?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:10.460,00:07:14.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we used some of the existing information from the
Dialogue: 0,00:07:14.460,00:07:18.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,first physics for the second one. So far it's a one-way coupling between
Dialogue: 0,00:07:18.460,00:07:22.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,those two physics. If you do want to introduce the reverse coupling,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:22.460,00:07:26.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,let's do a little experiment here. The material properties,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:26.460,00:07:30.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,as you see for titanium, is by default constant from that building
Dialogue: 0,00:07:30.460,00:07:34.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,folder. So the actual conductivity, as we mentioned,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:34.460,00:07:38.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,right now is a constant. If we make it a linear function
Dialogue: 0,00:07:38.460,00:07:42.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,in temperature, 1 minus 0.001 times T,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:42.460,00:07:46.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I'm going to use the square bracket just to neutralize
Dialogue: 0,00:07:46.460,00:07:50.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,the units in the temperature so that everything in this later part of the equation
Dialogue: 0,00:07:50.460,00:07:54.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,is a dimensionless number. So now basically I'm saying that
Dialogue: 0,00:07:54.460,00:07:58.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,the electric conductivity decreases as temperature goes up. So what do you
Dialogue: 0,00:07:58.460,00:08:02.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,think the maximum temperature would be? So right now we have
Dialogue: 0,00:08:02.460,00:08:06.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,700 and around 80. Let me actually
Dialogue: 0,00:08:06.460,00:08:10.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,add a maximum volume
Dialogue: 0,00:08:10.460,00:08:14.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,of temperature so we know exactly what's the peak temperature here, which is
Dialogue: 0,00:08:14.460,00:08:18.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,786.8. So after I change the electric conductivity,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:18.460,00:08:22.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,I haven't computed it yet. So what's your guess? Who thinks the temperature
Dialogue: 0,00:08:22.460,00:08:26.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,will go up? Who thinks the temperature
Dialogue: 0,00:08:26.460,00:08:30.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,will go down? Okay, so the remaining people think the
Dialogue: 0,00:08:30.460,00:08:34.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,temperature will remain unchanged. Let's test that.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:40.460,00:08:44.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright, so go back to that 3D plot. So now
Dialogue: 0,00:08:44.460,00:08:48.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,the peak temperature is actually 568. It decreased by about 200k.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:48.460,00:08:52.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,And why?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:52.460,00:08:56.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,Remember in the heat transfer equation, which part now changed?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:56.460,00:09:00.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,The heat source, right? The heat source is
Dialogue: 0,00:09:00.460,00:09:04.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,EC dot QRH. Let's take a look at EC dot QRH.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:04.460,00:09:08.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,Which is
Dialogue: 0,00:09:08.460,00:09:12.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,right here. Basically it's EC dot
Dialogue: 0,00:09:12.460,00:09:16.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,JX times EX plus the Y and Z components.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:16.460,00:09:20.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if you look up the JX definition, it's sigma
Dialogue: 0,00:09:20.460,00:09:24.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,times EX, right? So basically when the conductivity goes down,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:24.460,00:09:28.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,the heat source goes down. The EC dot QRH is proportional to
Dialogue: 0,00:09:28.460,00:09:32.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,the local conductivity times the field squares.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:32.460,00:09:36.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,Of course the field doesn't change because we haven't changed the applied potential.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:36.460,00:09:40.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the potential divided by distance doesn't change either. But the
Dialogue: 0,00:09:40.460,00:09:44.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,conductivity goes down. So the whole source goes down and then the temperature goes down.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:44.460,00:09:48.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is actually, if you think a little bit about the physics, you could
Dialogue: 0,00:09:48.460,00:09:52.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,with a little bit more time given, you can definitely arrive at the same conclusion
Dialogue: 0,00:09:52.460,00:09:56.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,as the program gives you, which is a lower temperature. But what happens
Dialogue: 0,00:09:56.460,00:10:00.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,if we change another thing? Say the thermal conductivity right here.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:00.460,00:10:04.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,We can make it a physical expression. It's actually thermal conductivity
Dialogue: 0,00:10:04.460,00:10:08.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,which goes as an exponential function in temperature.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:08.460,00:10:12.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,Like EXP minus T divided by something. And then what's going to happen?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:12.460,00:10:16.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the heat is going to dissipate slower and then it's going to accumulate a little bit
Dialogue: 0,00:10:16.460,00:10:20.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,faster. And those, basically it'll be a computing mechanism
Dialogue: 0,00:10:20.460,00:10:24.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,with the decreased conductivity. So we have more nonlinear
Dialogue: 0,00:10:24.460,00:10:28.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,factors showing up in your model and they contribute to the model in different ways.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:28.460,00:10:32.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's more difficult to predict what the actual results would be. So that's when the simulation
Dialogue: 0,00:10:32.460,00:10:34.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,actually comes in handy to give you a version of the model.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:34.460,00:10:38.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's a very simple control experiment of what's going to happen.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:38.460,00:10:42.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,Of course you have to make sure you are implementing the right thing and don't do typos.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:42.460,00:10:46.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, yeah, that's for the heat transfer physics. Any questions?
