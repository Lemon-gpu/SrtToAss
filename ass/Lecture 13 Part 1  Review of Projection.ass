Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:04.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,In the last lecture, we have a known function f of x that is known.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:06.080,00:00:12.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we are just trying to construct the best possible approximation of f
Dialogue: 0,00:00:12.360,00:00:16.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,within a finite dimensional space.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:17.840,00:00:23.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we first define a finite dimensional space.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:30.000,00:00:35.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,A finite dimensional space means a space of functions, a linear space of functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:35.500,00:00:42.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,And linear space means any linear combination of two functions in the space is still in the same space.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:43.500,00:00:56.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,So a finite dimensional space means any function g that can be represented as a linear combination.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:56.800,00:00:58.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,i goes from 1 to n.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:58.780,00:00:59.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,I call it gi.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:00.000,00:01:01.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,Of vi of x.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:03.640,00:01:11.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,And so that is for any g1, etc. to gn.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:11.580,00:01:21.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is a space that is equivalent in some sense to the n-dimensional space of real numbers.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:22.280,00:01:26.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for any combination of n real numbers,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:26.640,00:01:29.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,you can construct a unique element.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:29.080,00:01:30.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,In the space.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:31.520,00:01:38.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,By using these real numbers as linear combination coefficients on a particular set of bases.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:40.000,00:01:40.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So here,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:42.920,00:01:46.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,phi i, i goes from 1 to n,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:47.260,00:01:48.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,is a basis.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:50.680,00:01:50.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:51.340,00:01:53.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So once we have that basis,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:54.140,00:01:57.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,we can construct the best approximation of f.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:59.080,00:02:00.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:00.080,00:02:06.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,we can use the best approximation of f in x.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:06.080,00:02:07.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:07.080,00:02:08.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,we can use the best approximation of f in x.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:08.080,00:02:14.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,The best approximation of f in x can be obtained by minimizing the distance f minus g,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:14.080,00:02:19.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,such that g is in that space.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:19.080,00:02:24.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the distance in this case is the L2 distance,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:24.080,00:02:27.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,where the distance, the square of the distance, is defined as the integration function of the n-dimensional space.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:27.080,00:02:27.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, we can use the best approximation of f in x,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:27.840,00:02:31.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is defined as the integration from this domain.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:31.840,00:02:36.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, we need to specify that f is in a particular domain.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:36.840,00:02:40.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, and the L2 norm of the difference between two functions,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:40.840,00:02:46.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,is the integral of the square of the function.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:46.840,00:02:48.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then take a square root.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:48.840,00:02:51.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now because of we are having a square here,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:51.840,00:02:52.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,the square root cancels,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:52.840,00:02:56.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the square of the L2 norm is simply the integral of the square root.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:56.840,00:03:00.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,of the function.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:00.840,00:03:01.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:01.840,00:03:02.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,and now,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:02.840,00:03:08.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,we can further expand it to integration f minus integration of g .
Dialogue: 0,00:03:08.840,00:03:10.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, we are minimizing,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:10.840,00:03:12.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,now instead of g in x,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:12.840,00:03:14.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,we are minimizing g .
Dialogue: 0,00:03:14.840,00:03:16.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,i goes from 1 to n.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:16.840,00:03:20.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,We are minimizing over these coefficients,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:20.840,00:03:24.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,because we can represent g using linear combination of the basis.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:24.840,00:03:25.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, g .
Dialogue: 0,00:03:25.840,00:03:26.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,i,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:26.840,00:03:27.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,phi,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:27.840,00:03:28.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,i,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:28.840,00:03:29.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,square,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:29.840,00:03:30.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,dx.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:30.840,00:03:37.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we turn that optimization problem into a set of linear equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:37.840,00:03:44.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,How do we turn that into a linear equations?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:44.840,00:03:47.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,We use perturbation analysis.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:47.840,00:03:48.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Last lecture,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:48.840,00:03:53.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,we perturbed this function g a little bit.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:53.840,00:03:54.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:54.840,00:03:58.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we derived the condition that the minimizer has to ensure that
Dialogue: 0,00:03:58.840,00:04:02.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,the distance between f and g is going to be orthogonal
Dialogue: 0,00:04:02.840,00:04:06.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,to any function
Dialogue: 0,00:04:06.840,00:04:09.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,in the same linear space.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:09.840,00:04:10.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:10.840,00:04:11.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:11.840,00:04:20.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,through a perturbation or variational analysis,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:20.840,00:04:21.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,we found that
Dialogue: 0,00:04:21.840,00:04:24.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,in order to have this minimized,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:24.840,00:04:27.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,we must ensure that f minus g,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:27.840,00:04:30.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is the linear summation,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:30.840,00:04:34.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,has to be orthogonal to any function in the same space,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:34.840,00:04:37.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,which any function, of course, includes the basis.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:37.840,00:04:43.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, this times any of the phi j's has to be equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:43.840,00:04:51.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this turns into a linear equation a times g equal to b.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:51.840,00:04:53.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so this is the procedure we used last lecture.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:54.840,00:04:59.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,To construct the best approximation of a known function.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:59.840,00:05:00.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Of course,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:00.840,00:05:02.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,if we know what the function is,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:02.840,00:05:06.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,we can basically use the analytical form
Dialogue: 0,00:05:06.840,00:05:09.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,without having to construct an approximation.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:09.840,00:05:12.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, the real utility of this procedure,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:12.840,00:05:13.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,exactly the same procedure,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:13.840,00:05:15.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,is in solving differential equations,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:15.840,00:05:20.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,where we actually don't know the solution a priori.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:20.840,00:05:23.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,We only know the solution satisfies a certain differential equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:23.840,00:05:26.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,It turns out we can use the same procedure
Dialogue: 0,00:05:26.840,00:05:29.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,to solve differential equations.
