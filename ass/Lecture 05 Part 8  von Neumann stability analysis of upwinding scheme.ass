Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:06.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, change the spatial discretization or change the time discretization, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:06.400,00:00:09.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let me explain both cases.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:09.540,00:00:13.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,So first of all, forward Euler is not the only way to integrate differential equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:14.640,00:00:23.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you look at MATLAB's ODE45, it is using something that is a lot better than forward Euler.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:24.740,00:00:29.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Not only it is more accurate, it is fourth order and fifth order, but also the stability region is different.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:30.540,00:00:38.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,For example, there is a well-known Rangakata scheme called RK4, fourth order Rangakata scheme,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:39.420,00:00:47.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,whose stability region for real of lambda t and the imaginary of delta t lambda, the same thing, is something like that.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:51.560,00:00:58.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right, so for the Rangakata scheme, fourth order, the scheme is stable in this region,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:58.160,00:00:59.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,which actually includes...
Dialogue: 0,00:01:00.000,00:01:04.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,All these points we are talking about lying on the imaginary axis.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:06.460,00:01:10.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So one solution is just to use RK4 to solve the equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:13.020,00:01:16.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,It will be slightly more lines of code you need to write, but like, no problem.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:17.840,00:01:19.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or just use ODE45.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:20.020,00:01:20.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,You'll be okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:22.040,00:01:22.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:23.160,00:01:24.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that is one solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:24.700,00:01:29.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,Change time discretization.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:30.000,00:01:39.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Another potential solution is change spatial discretization.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:39.640,00:01:43.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,Spatial discretization.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:45.860,00:01:47.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:48.960,00:01:54.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, for example, let's do a trade-off.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:54.080,00:01:55.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Instead of using...
Dialogue: 0,00:01:56.020,00:01:59.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Instead of using...
Dialogue: 0,00:02:00.000,00:02:00.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is D.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:00.640,00:02:03.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Instead of using the more accurate central difference scheme,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:04.640,00:02:10.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,let's use I plus 1 minus UI over delta t.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:11.900,00:02:16.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's bias towards one side to see what does it change stability.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:17.240,00:02:21.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,We know it makes the accuracy worse, but can it make stability better?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:22.660,00:02:22.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:22.900,00:02:26.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,So sometimes we have to do a trade-off between stability and accuracy.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:26.980,00:02:28.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in this case, we plug in the same...
Dialogue: 0,00:02:30.000,00:02:31.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,Free expansion here.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:31.880,00:02:38.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,UI is equal to summation K of U head of K e to the J Ki delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:39.140,00:02:42.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,We get D U head of K dt on the left-hand side.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:43.540,00:02:49.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is from here plus U times U head of K from here.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:49.700,00:02:58.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,And exponential of J K delta x minus...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:00.000,00:03:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,U over...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:02.000,00:03:05.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, so this is delta x over delta x equal to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:06.680,00:03:06.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:07.020,00:03:08.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is it clear how I got this?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:09.840,00:03:15.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is basically plugging I plus 1 into here and factor it out.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:16.260,00:03:26.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,The common term that is e to the J Ki delta x got pulled out, right, from both the D U dt and also this term and also this term.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:27.340,00:03:29.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we are left with this.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:30.000,00:03:42.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,And what we have is D U head of K dt equal to minus U, this guy over here, times U head of K.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:43.620,00:03:46.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, this is our lambda.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:48.440,00:03:51.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any idea where it is on the complex plane?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:54.520,00:03:56.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's draw the complex plane.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:56.980,00:03:58.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,And hopefully it is on this side.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:58.660,00:03:59.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's draw it a little bit like that.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:00.000,00:04:04.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,So real of lambda, imaginary of lambda.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:06.500,00:04:07.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:09.940,00:04:13.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,E to the J K delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:14.020,00:04:18.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And again, remember K times delta x ranges from minus pi to pi.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:19.640,00:04:24.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Just because of the range of K and the relation between N and delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:25.860,00:04:28.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,So N times delta x equal to 2 pi.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:28.460,00:04:29.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And K goes from minus.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:30.160,00:04:32.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,N over 2 to N over 2 minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:33.740,00:04:42.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,So e to the J times something that ranges from minus pi to pi goes in where on the complex plane?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:42.440,00:04:52.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's say just a J x.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:54.500,00:04:55.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,J x.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:57.420,00:04:58.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,What is it?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:58.900,00:04:59.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's a unit.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:00.140,00:05:00.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's a unit circle.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:00.460,00:05:00.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Exactly.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:01.640,00:05:03.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's the unit circle.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:05.240,00:05:05.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:06.240,00:05:12.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,As x goes from, when x is minus pi, it's over here.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:12.680,00:05:14.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,And you go over here.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:16.500,00:05:18.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,And goes all the way to here.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:18.180,00:05:18.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's a unit circle.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:19.960,00:05:20.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:20.920,00:05:24.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Unit circle minus 1 is going to shift it to here.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:24.640,00:05:26.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's this.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:27.540,00:05:28.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,And, okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:28.560,00:05:29.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,So minus 1 is going to shift.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:30.360,00:05:31.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's going to shift it to here.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:31.560,00:05:34.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the green line is e to the J x minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:36.320,00:05:36.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:38.220,00:05:39.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the green one.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:40.340,00:05:42.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that is multiplied.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:43.240,00:05:49.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So actually let me put it as lambda delta t.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:49.940,00:05:57.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So our analysis, we want to look at where this lambda delta t is.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:57.640,00:05:59.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Which is minus u.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:59.540,00:06:11.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's u times delta t over delta x times this green circle over here.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:11.780,00:06:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we are expanding this green circle by a coefficient.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:16.380,00:06:21.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,That is u times delta t divided by delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:24.420,00:06:28.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,So is that going to make us stable for forward roller?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:29.540,00:06:37.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this part is on this green circle, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:37.880,00:06:39.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we are multiplying green circle.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:40.100,00:06:41.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Remember, this is the origin.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:41.380,00:06:43.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,We are multiplying the green circle by this number.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:44.720,00:06:46.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if, for example, u is negative.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:47.400,00:06:50.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,If u is negative, then this number is a positive number.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:50.520,00:06:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,We are expanding this circle.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:52.580,00:06:55.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,Expanding or shrinking this circle depending on if this is positive or negative.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:55.780,00:06:57.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,For example, if.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:58.660,00:06:59.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,If.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:59.540,00:07:03.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,Minus u delta t over delta x is equal to 0.5.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:06.960,00:07:07.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,What is it?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:08.220,00:07:09.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:09.420,00:07:10.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is minus 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:10.300,00:07:19.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,If it's equal to 0.5, then my lambda delta t is going to be this circle shrinked by a factor of 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:19.240,00:07:22.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,So instead of this being minus 2, this will be minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:22.680,00:07:25.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,And instead of minus 1, it will be minus half.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:26.780,00:07:28.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is actually within.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:29.540,00:07:34.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,The stability region of forward roller, which is a circle that is twice as big as this.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:34.920,00:07:36.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the stability region.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:37.440,00:07:47.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,And all my eigenvalues lies on this smaller circle, which is completely contained in this big stability region.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:50.720,00:07:51.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:51.240,00:07:56.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is just an example of minus u times delta t over delta x equal to 0.5.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:57.720,00:07:59.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,And in fact.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:59.540,00:08:04.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,As long as this number lies in between 0 and 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:05.480,00:08:08.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,The green circle is going to be contained in this black circle.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:08.460,00:08:08.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:11.540,00:08:13.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes, that's a very good question.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:14.440,00:08:15.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,If, for example.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:16.500,00:08:17.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,You.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:17.320,00:08:17.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:17.680,00:08:17.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,So.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:18.000,00:08:21.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if there are two cases where the scheme is unstable.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:21.660,00:08:26.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,One case is if u delta t over delta x is positive.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:27.040,00:08:29.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Which means when I take a minus sign.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:29.280,00:08:30.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's negative.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:31.680,00:08:35.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,What is the effect of multiplying the green circle by a negative number?

Dialogue: 0,00:08:46.120,00:08:47.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:47.200,00:08:48.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's add a page.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:49.560,00:08:49.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So.

Dialogue: 0,00:09:01.560,00:09:03.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's draw the good case.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:05.900,00:09:07.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is.
