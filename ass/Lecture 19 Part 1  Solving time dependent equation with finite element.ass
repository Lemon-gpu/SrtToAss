Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:07.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,The final thing we want to discuss for finite element is how to solve time-dependent equations using finite elements.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:08.420,00:00:14.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,We have previously focused on mostly steady-state equations, including Poisson's equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:15.020,00:00:23.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,The second derivative is equal to a known function, and we also touched the beam equation, which is again a steady-state equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:23.840,00:00:33.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,The question today is how do we discretize the time derivative using finite volume, or how do we deal with the time derivative?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:34.520,00:00:42.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,How do we transform the PD with DDT unit into an OD as we did before?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:43.240,00:00:53.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,We are going to use again a very simple example, just adding a time derivative term onto the right-hand side of a Poisson's equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:53.840,00:00:59.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So Poisson's equation would be the second derivative equal to a given function f.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:00.120,00:01:02.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Today we are going to look at a heat equation instead.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:03.560,00:01:06.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so we remember infinite element.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:07.500,00:01:10.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,How do we start in discretizing an equation?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:11.080,00:01:17.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,We started by multiplying this equation with a test function, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:17.540,00:01:23.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,With an arbitrary test function within a certain space, and thereby derive the weak form.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:23.840,00:01:29.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,All finite element discretization started with a weak form.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:29.200,00:01:40.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if we multiply this equation with a V, so let's say, let's use the bracket as inner product in the L2 sense.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:40.840,00:01:49.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the bracket is going to be integration over the entire space, V times the ODT over the x.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:49.400,00:01:53.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Would be equal to V.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:53.840,00:02:03.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have a second derivative for all V within a certain space that we don't know yet.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:03.160,00:02:05.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's decide about it later.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:05.160,00:02:10.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so let's now write down what this inner product is.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:10.160,00:02:20.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,So first of all, we have V times the ODT over, let's say, a one-dimensional space from A to B.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:20.160,00:02:23.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,Would be equal to the integral from A to B.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:23.840,00:02:27.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,V times the second derivative of U.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:27.840,00:02:36.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if we want to use the same technique we used to deal with Poisson's equation, on the right-hand side of this equation, what should we do?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:36.840,00:02:38.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Integrate by parts, right.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:38.840,00:02:40.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So here we need some boundary conditions.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:40.840,00:02:46.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's assume we have a simple boundary condition, U A equal to U B equal to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:46.840,00:02:50.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then through integration by parts,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:50.840,00:02:51.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,we know that this V, or the integral from A to B, is equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:51.840,00:02:52.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have a simple boundary condition, U A equal to U B equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:53.840,00:02:56.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we also have to satisfy the same boundary condition.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:56.840,00:03:02.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So with integration by parts, the boundary terms get removed through the boundary condition.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:02.840,00:03:07.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we also are removing the second-order derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:07.840,00:03:14.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,And both U and V have a first-order derivative in this bilinear form.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:14.840,00:03:17.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:17.840,00:03:18.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:18.840,00:03:22.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we also look at the left-hand side.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:22.840,00:03:29.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,And realize that we are integrating only in space, not in time.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:29.840,00:03:35.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the time derivative can be removed, can be pulled out of the integral.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:35.840,00:03:45.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the left-hand side becomes d dt of a integral U V dx,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:45.840,00:03:51.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,would be equal to minus integration of derivative of V,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:51.840,00:03:58.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,derivative of U dx.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:58.840,00:04:01.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now we get two bilinear forms.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:01.840,00:04:04.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,One is integration of U V.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:04.840,00:04:09.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,The other integration of du dx times dv dx.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:09.840,00:04:11.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right? Both are bilinear forms.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:11.840,00:04:18.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Except for one bilinear form has a time derivative in it.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:18.840,00:04:19.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:19.840,00:04:26.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,To discretize this equation, we apply the same type of finite element discretization
Dialogue: 0,00:04:26.840,00:04:29.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,on both bilinear forms at the same time.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:29.840,00:04:32.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,What is that discretization?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:32.840,00:04:41.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,The discretization is restricting ourselves from an infinite dimensional space
Dialogue: 0,00:04:41.840,00:04:44.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,to a finite dimensional subspace.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:44.840,00:04:46.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:46.840,00:04:48.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for discretization,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:48.840,00:04:51.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,so up to here, everything is analytical.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:51.840,00:04:55.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now let's switch to a discretized form.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:55.840,00:05:10.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now, restrict U to be a summation of I goes from 1 to n of U I,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:10.840,00:05:13.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is now a number instead of a function,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:13.840,00:05:14.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,times phi I,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:14.840,00:05:17.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,which are the basis functions of the finite dimensional space.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:17.840,00:05:20.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now we have the finite dimensional subspace.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:20.840,00:05:25.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Here, we can use the piecewise linear and continuous space
Dialogue: 0,00:05:25.840,00:05:28.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,as we did before in Poisson's equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:28.840,00:05:30.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:30.840,00:05:31.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:31.840,00:05:34.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Where the phi's, if we draw them,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:34.840,00:05:36.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,phi 1 is going to be like that,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:36.840,00:05:38.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,phi 2 is going to be like that in 1D,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:38.840,00:05:40.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,phi 3 is going to be like that.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:40.840,00:05:42.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So these are the piecewise,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:42.840,00:05:46.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,these are the basis functions of the piecewise continuous and continuous space.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:47.840,00:05:50.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,And these are the continuous and piecewise linear functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:50.840,00:05:53.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well, the continuous and piecewise linear functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:53.840,00:05:54.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:54.840,00:06:02.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now we also substitute phi j to our test function v,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:02.840,00:06:07.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,because if this is satisfied for v equal to any of the phi j's,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:07.840,00:06:12.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,this can be satisfied by the principle of linear superposition
Dialogue: 0,00:06:12.840,00:06:14.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,for all the v's.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:14.840,00:06:17.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,That can be expressed as linear combination of phi j's.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:17.840,00:06:26.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what we have is d dt of integral a to b.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:26.840,00:06:30.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,u is now a linear combination.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:30.840,00:06:35.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,v is now phi j, phi x,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:35.840,00:06:40.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,is equal to minus of now the derivative of v,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:40.840,00:06:42.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is phi j,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:42.840,00:06:44.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the derivative of u,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:44.840,00:06:46.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is a summation.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:47.840,00:06:51.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have the integral of ui,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:51.840,00:06:56.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,the derivative of phi i.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:56.840,00:07:01.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,The right hand side is exactly the same as we dealt with in Poisson's equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:01.840,00:07:05.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,We pull the summation and the ui out of the integral,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:05.840,00:07:10.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,thereby getting summation of i goes from 1 to n,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:10.840,00:07:16.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,ui times the integral of derivative of phi j,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:16.840,00:07:19.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,times the derivative of phi i.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:19.840,00:07:24.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is exactly the matrix we call A.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:24.840,00:07:30.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is the j-th entry of the matrix A
Dialogue: 0,00:07:30.840,00:07:35.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,we used before to discretize the Poisson's equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:35.840,00:07:36.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:36.840,00:07:39.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:39.840,00:07:42.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the left hand side is a little bit different.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:42.840,00:07:44.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,The left hand side, we still pull all of these out.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:44.840,00:07:45.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,But the left hand side, we still pull all of these out.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:45.840,00:07:48.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,But remember these ui's,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:48.840,00:07:52.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,they are individual numbers at every t.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:52.840,00:07:59.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,But these ui's are what makes the solution u time dependent.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:59.840,00:08:05.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So ui's are actually functions of t,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:05.840,00:08:07.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,while the phi j and phi i,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:07.840,00:08:10.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,they are not functions of t.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:10.840,00:08:14.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Therefore, we can pull the summation of ui
Dialogue: 0,00:08:14.840,00:08:17.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,out of the integral.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:17.840,00:08:22.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,But we cannot pull it out of the time derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:22.840,00:08:24.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,What we can pull out of the time derivative
Dialogue: 0,00:08:24.840,00:08:28.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,is the remaining integral in space.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:28.840,00:08:30.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's write it down.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:30.840,00:08:33.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,d dt of...
Dialogue: 0,00:08:33.840,00:08:36.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the summation can be pulled out.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:36.840,00:08:37.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:37.840,00:08:38.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Summation can be pulled out,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:38.840,00:08:39.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,but like,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:39.840,00:08:43.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,d ui dt has to be put onto the time derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:43.840,00:08:46.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then we have integration of
Dialogue: 0,00:08:46.840,00:08:48.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,phi i,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:48.840,00:08:49.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,phi j,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:49.840,00:08:51.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,d x.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:51.840,00:08:54.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,And these are not in the time derivative
Dialogue: 0,00:08:54.840,00:08:57.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,because they are not functions of time.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:57.840,00:08:59.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:59.840,00:09:00.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,this is another,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:00.840,00:09:04.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,this is the discretization of a different bilinear form.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:06.840,00:09:11.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,This bilinear form also is discretized into a matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:11.840,00:09:12.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,And let's call it mj.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:13.840,00:09:19.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Equating the left hand side to the right hand side,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:19.840,00:09:21.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,what we get is m,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:21.840,00:09:23.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,the matrix m,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:23.840,00:09:24.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,okay?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:24.840,00:09:25.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Think of mj,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:25.840,00:09:28.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,I multiply it by d ui dt.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:28.840,00:09:30.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is m times d u dt,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:30.840,00:09:36.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,where u is now the vector of u1, u2, u3, etc.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:36.840,00:09:38.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is a vector times a matrix,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:38.840,00:09:40.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,being the left hand side.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:40.840,00:09:42.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the right hand side is equal to
Dialogue: 0,00:09:42.840,00:09:46.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,minus a matrix times the vector u.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:50.840,00:09:52.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Interestingly, we get,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:52.840,00:09:54.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,when we discretize this equation,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:54.840,00:09:59.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,we don't get a d vector u dt equal to a matrix times u.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:59.840,00:10:01.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,We get another matrix,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:01.840,00:10:03.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,we call the math matrix.
