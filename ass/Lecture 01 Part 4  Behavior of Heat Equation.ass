Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:07.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we're going to look at these equations individually, but before that, let's take MATLAB
Dialogue: 0,00:00:07.760,00:00:23.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,and look at the evolution, the behavior of this equation as we draw it.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:25.220,00:00:28.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So do you see the fonts clearly enough?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:28.540,00:00:33.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Do you see what I'm typing clearly enough?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:33.220,00:00:34.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:34.380,00:00:39.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So first of all, I need two parameters, u and kappa.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:39.640,00:00:45.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is to help you understand the behavior of this equation when the right-hand side
Dialogue: 0,00:00:45.560,00:00:48.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,f is equal to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:48.840,00:00:55.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's look at our first case when u is equal to zero and kappa, let's say, is equal
Dialogue: 0,00:00:55.580,00:00:56.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,to one.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:56.580,00:00:57.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:57.580,00:00:58.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's look at it.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:58.500,00:01:01.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's look at this, the behavior of this equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:01.400,00:01:07.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,What I'm going to do is I'm going to ask one of you to come over here and draw a particular
Dialogue: 0,00:01:07.020,00:01:10.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,initial condition on the screen.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:10.180,00:01:15.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is going to demonstrate how the solution is going to evolve as a function of time.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:15.360,00:01:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So initial condition is t equal to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:18.000,00:01:23.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,And after you draw the solution, you just draw it from the left to the right or from
Dialogue: 0,00:01:23.880,00:01:25.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,the right to the left.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:25.200,00:01:27.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is periodic.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:27.240,00:01:28.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the domain is periodic.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:28.340,00:01:33.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,Whatever is here should also be here.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:33.020,00:01:37.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,And you should see how the solution evolves as time increases.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:37.280,00:01:43.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,So can I have somebody, brave person, to come over here to draw an initial condition?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:43.580,00:01:44.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,Please.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:44.580,00:01:45.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,Thank you.

Dialogue: 0,00:02:02.340,00:02:04.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the solution you draw, what happens?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:04.340,00:02:09.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,Can somebody describe to me what happens after Happy draws the initial condition?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:09.100,00:02:11.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's smooth out.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:11.340,00:02:15.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's smoothies out very quickly.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:15.340,00:02:16.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:16.340,00:02:18.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the solution, Happy went, Happy was drawing the solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:18.580,00:02:25.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,Some people was smiling, laughing because he was drawing a very jaggy, very non-smooth
Dialogue: 0,00:02:25.020,00:02:26.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:26.020,00:02:27.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,And as soon as he pulls the hand, you see the solution is going to be smooth.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:27.460,00:02:27.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,And you can see that the solution is going to be smooth.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:27.720,00:02:27.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:27.820,00:02:34.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the hand, as time starts to increase, the solution becomes smooth very, very fast.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:34.820,00:02:35.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:35.820,00:02:36.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:36.820,00:02:37.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,Very good.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:37.820,00:02:40.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, Happy, I want to ask you a question.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:40.500,00:02:54.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,If I don't want that to happen, if I want the solution to decrease, to smooth out in
Dialogue: 0,00:02:54.820,00:02:55.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,a much slower rate.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:55.820,00:02:56.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:57.820,00:02:59.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,What should I change over here?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:59.820,00:03:02.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think you should lower the value of kappa.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:02.820,00:03:04.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,I should lower the value of kappa.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:04.820,00:03:05.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's exactly right.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:05.820,00:03:11.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,So because kappa is multiplied on this second order derivative term, and we are going to
Dialogue: 0,00:03:11.820,00:03:19.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,see later, it controls how much diffusion or how fast, how strong this term is in smoothing
Dialogue: 0,00:03:19.820,00:03:21.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,out the solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:21.820,00:03:22.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:22.820,00:03:25.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's change it dramatically.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:25.820,00:03:27.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,By a factor of a thousand.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:27.820,00:03:34.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,And can somebody else come and draw a different solution, initial condition, and see how the
Dialogue: 0,00:03:34.820,00:03:35.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,effect is?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:35.820,00:03:36.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,Please.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:36.820,00:03:41.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,I almost got a cramps here.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:41.820,00:03:47.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to start with this one.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:47.820,00:03:48.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:48.820,00:03:49.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the initial condition.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:49.820,00:03:50.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm going to start with this one.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:50.820,00:03:51.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to start with this one.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:51.820,00:03:52.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm going to start with this one.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:52.820,00:03:53.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then I'm going to start with this one.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:53.820,00:03:54.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is a 커 exploit in terms of the spiritual URL system.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:54.820,00:03:55.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm going talk about Lao's

Dialogue: 0,00:04:18.820,00:04:20.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean, I can open this today.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:20.820,00:04:21.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,I can open it and I can have the following.

Dialogue: 0,00:04:22.820,00:04:23.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that's what I'm doing.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:23.820,00:04:29.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,and if you look very carefully you should see for example if you observe
Dialogue: 0,00:04:29.340,00:04:36.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,here you should see the solution is smoothed out very very slowly right so
Dialogue: 0,00:04:36.720,00:04:42.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,this here it is increasing slowly and here for example the peak is going to be
Dialogue: 0,00:04:42.240,00:04:47.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,dropping very very slowly so that's the effect of copper when you make copper
Dialogue: 0,00:04:47.400,00:04:58.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,smaller the strength of the diffusion gets a lot smaller so let's analyze that
Dialogue: 0,00:04:58.100,00:05:04.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,using what's called a Fourier series
