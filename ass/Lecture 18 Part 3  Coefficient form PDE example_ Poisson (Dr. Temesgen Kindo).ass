Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:07.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,I will demonstrate this with an example. Is it clear so far?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:07.560,00:00:10.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:10.140,00:00:18.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,You can make it non-dimensional.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:18.840,00:00:19.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:19.240,00:00:21.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,For the conversion, which one is better?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:21.600,00:00:29.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you normalize the data, it's not because the conversion or it's because the T is too
Dialogue: 0,00:00:29.840,00:00:30.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,hard or something?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:30.840,00:00:31.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,OK.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:31.840,00:00:38.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if I get your question properly, you're asking if you don't non-dimensionalize in
Dialogue: 0,00:00:38.140,00:00:44.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,the convergence, the quantity of the error it's calculating is going to be dimensional.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:44.440,00:00:46.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,And how is that then going to be handled?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:46.600,00:00:47.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:47.600,00:00:48.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,OK.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:48.600,00:00:49.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's a good question.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:49.600,00:00:51.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,So how it is handled is if you don't dimensionalize.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:51.600,00:00:59.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,In the solver sequence, you pick a scaling for your independent file.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:59.080,00:01:02.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you can specify a scaling, how it should scale it.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:02.540,00:01:07.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it will actually divide the solver when it calculates the error before it puts it
Dialogue: 0,00:01:07.780,00:01:09.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,into a tolerance.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:09.240,00:01:11.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,It will divide it by the scaling you provide.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:11.240,00:01:14.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then I don't need to change my equation, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:14.240,00:01:15.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,No.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:15.240,00:01:19.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Just use the, all of them in the term of the habit dimensions?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:19.240,00:01:20.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:20.240,00:01:21.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,You have dimensions and you can change it.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:21.240,00:01:21.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,OK.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:21.600,00:01:24.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then in the convergence check, you would put a scaling.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:24.080,00:01:25.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,OK.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:25.080,00:01:26.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:26.080,00:01:27.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Does that answer the question?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:27.080,00:01:28.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,OK.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:28.080,00:01:33.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's say we want to model the Poisson equation to start simple with a boundary
Dialogue: 0,00:01:33.420,00:01:38.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,condition 0, a boundary condition 0 everywhere.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:38.420,00:01:44.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now the way you use this template is by just matching the templates with the equation you
Dialogue: 0,00:01:44.080,00:01:45.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,have.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:45.080,00:01:46.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,What is the template?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:46.080,00:01:48.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,The template is this, what we have in the domain.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:48.760,00:01:50.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,But what is your equation?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:50.080,00:01:51.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Your equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:51.080,00:01:52.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's the first equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:52.560,00:01:54.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you don't have all these terms.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:54.560,00:01:55.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,What do we have?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:55.560,00:02:02.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you have c is equal to 1 and f is equal to 1 and everything else 0 in that equation,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:02.560,00:02:04.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,you get the Poisson equation, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:04.840,00:02:07.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,With the source term being 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:07.240,00:02:11.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So then you have your set in the domain.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:11.060,00:02:14.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then now you want to pick what happens in the boundary.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:14.940,00:02:18.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for what happens in the boundary, this is going to be a Drischli boundary condition.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:18.600,00:02:19.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,The template is going to be u is equal to 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:19.600,00:02:20.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you have the first equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:20.600,00:02:21.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you have a set of 2, you have the second one.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:21.600,00:02:22.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you have r is equal to 0, then you get the Poisson equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:22.600,00:02:23.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,Thank you.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:23.600,00:02:24.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what happens is that you get r is equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:24.600,00:02:25.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,But then if you don't have it, for what?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:25.600,00:02:26.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you had r is equal to r, then here what we have is r is equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:26.600,00:02:28.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,So just put r is equal to 0 and you are done.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:28.980,00:02:34.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I will now go into the software and show how to enter this.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:34.960,00:02:37.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is it clear so far?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:37.480,00:02:38.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:38.480,00:02:45.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if I start the software here, when you start a new model, as you would have seen
Dialogue: 0,00:02:45.520,00:02:48.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,on Monday, you can start with a model wizard or a blank wizard.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:48.600,00:02:49.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you started with a model wizard, you can becomes a model wizard on Monday.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:49.600,00:02:50.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's pretty easy.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:50.600,00:02:53.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,The first thing is you have to select your special dimension.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:54.000,00:02:55.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's say we are going to do a 2D problem.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:57.000,00:02:58.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then you pick 2D.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:59.240,00:03:05.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then you pick your physics, but in this case, you're not going to use any of the pre-built physics-based interfaces.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:05.800,00:03:09.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,You are going to use the mathematics interface.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:09.840,00:03:12.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,And you come here, you come to PDE.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:12.880,00:03:14.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,We're going to use the coefficient form now.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:15.080,00:03:16.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'll show you the general form later.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:16.560,00:03:20.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you use the coefficient form, add that.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:21.980,00:03:25.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And here you can decide what to call the independent variable.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:26.140,00:03:28.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So by default, it wants to call it U.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:28.660,00:03:31.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,But if you're, for example, solving a temperature problem,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:31.740,00:03:41.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,and you want this to be similar to the variable name you are using often, then you can rename it.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:42.040,00:03:46.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,And here you specify the units for the dimension and for the source there.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:46.560,00:03:50.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's leave this as it is now.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:51.620,00:03:51.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Study.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:52.300,00:03:53.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then you pick your study type.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:53.560,00:03:55.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Are you doing a stationary study?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:55.920,00:03:59.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is this an equilibrium problem where the time derivatives are all zero now?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:00.120,00:04:03.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or is this a time-dependent problem, an eigenvalue problem?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:03.740,00:04:05.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's say this is a stationary problem.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:08.480,00:04:09.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:09.000,00:04:13.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,The equation is stationary, but it's not finding.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:14.020,00:04:14.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,I just can call it a function.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:15.480,00:04:16.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:16.560,00:04:20.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,But at this point, we haven't really specified the equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:21.020,00:04:24.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,All we have said is we want to use equation-based modeling.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:24.960,00:04:25.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:25.600,00:04:26.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:27.120,00:04:28.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,But that's a good concern.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:28.520,00:04:29.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'll show you what happens.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:29.900,00:04:32.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So here you would define your geometry.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:32.720,00:04:35.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's say we just want to solve this on a unit square.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:36.640,00:04:43.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I right-click on geometry, pick square, pick the dimensions, one by one.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:43.460,00:04:44.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's say the default was one.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:44.660,00:04:46.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is my domain.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:46.560,00:04:51.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now the next thing is if I, there are three nodes here.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:51.980,00:04:56.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,Your equation, your default boundary condition, and your initial condition.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:57.580,00:04:59.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now let's go to the equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:00.180,00:05:01.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is the equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:01.180,00:05:04.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if you expand this equation section here, you will see the template.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:06.320,00:05:09.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's saying it wants to solve this.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:09.840,00:05:12.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now you have to specify what is c.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:13.120,00:05:14.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,C is in our case one.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:14.360,00:05:16.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we keep c is equal to one.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:16.560,00:05:22.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,If we had no source term, we will come back and put this f to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:23.340,00:05:29.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then, okay, now I have ea set to zero by default, ba to one.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:30.100,00:05:32.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,But these values are zero, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:32.280,00:05:35.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,I can type zero, but I can also not type them.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:36.060,00:05:39.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because in a stationary study, it will ignore the time derivatives.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:39.880,00:05:44.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's say I actually had a non-zero mass term.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:45.060,00:05:46.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,First, I want to solve it.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:46.560,00:05:49.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,For a stationary case.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:50.020,00:05:52.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Next, I want to solve it for a time-dependent case.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:52.380,00:06:00.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,So instead of putting the equation twice, I can just add another study, but make that study time-dependent.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:00.720,00:06:03.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the stationary study will ignore the time derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:03.840,00:06:06.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,The transient study will keep the time derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:07.180,00:06:08.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,Does that address your question?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:09.100,00:06:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, yes, I can put this to zero, but the time derivatives are ignored anyway in a stationary study.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:16.560,00:06:21.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then you can check this other coefficient.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:21.440,00:06:22.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,They are all zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:22.660,00:06:23.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,What we want is this.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:23.800,00:06:27.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, actually, we're just solving the Laplace equation since I put f is equal to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:28.420,00:06:30.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then the next thing is the boundary condition.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:31.200,00:06:36.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,The boundary conditions are setting the Neumann boundary condition to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:36.500,00:06:37.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's the default.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:37.800,00:06:42.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So basically, physics-wise, that's no flux of the quantity you are conserving.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:43.080,00:06:46.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in a chemical reaction problem, this would be no concentration,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:46.340,00:06:46.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,cross-division, no flux.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:46.540,00:06:53.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in the boundary, in a structural mechanics problem, the momentum flux being stress, it would mean free of stress.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:53.900,00:06:58.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,But if your boundary conditions are different from the default, you specify them.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:58.480,00:07:06.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if I right-click here, right, on the physics or on the equation, these ones are things I could do on the domain.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:07.400,00:07:09.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,But these ones are boundary condition.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:09.660,00:07:11.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in our case, we have a Richelieu boundary condition.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:11.840,00:07:12.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,I click that.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:12.400,00:07:16.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then you choose where to apply this.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:16.540,00:07:23.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,I could keep clicking, but if you are applying them for all boundary, you can also use this all boundaries.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:23.840,00:07:26.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then what is this?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:26.300,00:07:28.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,What is your solution outside?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:29.520,00:07:35.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,We are using here u is equal to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:35.540,00:07:39.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if I specify that, that is already zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:40.060,00:07:43.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then you build your mesh, and now you solve.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:46.540,00:07:51.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now this is going to give me a zero solution back.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:51.740,00:07:54.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm solving the Laplace equation with zero boundary conditions.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:54.860,00:07:56.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,But what we wanted to do was the Poisson equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:56.980,00:08:05.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if I go back to the coefficient form and put f is equal to one and solve that.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:09.920,00:08:10.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,What?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:14.320,00:08:16.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,I put the boundary condition.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:16.540,00:08:19.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, I put constraints.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:21.360,00:08:24.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,I should have put the Richelieu boundary condition.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:25.780,00:08:26.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,All boundaries.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:26.660,00:08:26.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:33.500,00:08:37.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is Poisson equation with source terms equal to one.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:37.520,00:08:42.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean, here I can post-process it for other quantities, maybe make a contour plot
Dialogue: 0,00:08:42.040,00:08:45.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,or maybe here instead of just surface.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:45.660,00:08:45.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:45.760,00:08:46.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I can do that.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:46.320,00:08:49.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I can do the surface, add a height expression.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:51.220,00:08:52.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,This would be my solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:56.060,00:09:04.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,But the idea is if you're using the coefficient form, you just come here in the equations template,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:05.080,00:09:13.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then you fill in these terms so that the template matches the equation you have.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:14.700,00:09:16.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Here I have initial values.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:16.300,00:09:23.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,In the time-dependent, in a time-dependent problem, those are physically meaningful quantities
Dialogue: 0,00:09:23.300,00:09:25.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,of where did you start?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:25.060,00:09:26.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Where are you starting?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:26.580,00:09:31.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,What was the state of your problem at t is equal to zero or whenever you start solving
Dialogue: 0,00:09:31.060,00:09:31.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,this problem?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:32.140,00:09:39.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,But for a stationary problem, they don't have any physical meaning.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:39.660,00:09:43.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,But can you think of a way they can be useful?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:43.200,00:09:45.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any guess?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:46.300,00:09:49.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, can you make it more, can you elaborate more?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:49.780,00:09:54.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,Convergence and next configuration?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:54.780,00:09:56.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,Exactly.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:56.400,00:09:59.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So these equations are potentially nonlinear, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:59.260,00:10:04.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,In this case, you win the first time.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:04.240,00:10:11.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,In this case, we are solving a linear problem but think of solving this nonlinear problem.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:11.460,00:10:12.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,What happens?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:12.460,00:10:14.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,The weak form will convert this and then when you add the finite element it's going to tell
Dialogue: 0,00:10:14.100,00:10:15.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,this.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:15.100,00:10:16.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what happens?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:16.100,00:10:22.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,at the end what you will have is a system of nonlinear algebraic equations for the nodal
Dialogue: 0,00:10:22.100,00:10:23.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,values.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:23.100,00:10:27.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,So when you have nonlinear algebraic equations, you're going to solve them using a Newton-Raphson
Dialogue: 0,00:10:27.980,00:10:30.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,or other method like that.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:30.600,00:10:36.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,And there, you are going to start with an initial value and iteratively try to get to
Dialogue: 0,00:10:36.380,00:10:37.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,your solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:37.800,00:10:42.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So even though this initial value is not, it's physically meaningless for a stationary
Dialogue: 0,00:10:42.540,00:10:44.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,problem, you can nudge it.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:44.860,00:10:49.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you have any a priori information, if you have some estimate about your solution, you
Dialogue: 0,00:10:49.660,00:10:56.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,can type that in and then it will help the solver converge faster.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:56.300,00:11:00.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or this is assuming you have a unique solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:00.120,00:11:05.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,In cases where you have multiple solutions, you can also use this initial value to sort
Dialogue: 0,00:11:05.000,00:11:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,of bias, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:06.000,00:11:11.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,It will most likely converge to the solution closer to the initial value you are putting
Dialogue: 0,00:11:11.840,00:11:12.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,in.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:12.540,00:11:15.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
