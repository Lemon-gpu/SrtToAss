Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:03.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,So first of all, we need to define the so-called Sobolev space.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:04.820,00:00:09.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the Sobolev space is an extension of the L2 space.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:09.820,00:00:19.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if you did functional analysis, you know like L2 space is all functions whose square is integrable.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:19.660,00:00:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's all the functions where the integration between...
Dialogue: 0,00:00:24.000,00:00:27.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,So usually you define an interval, right, in between A and B.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:27.880,00:00:32.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's say actually omega because this actually extends to multiple dimensions.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:33.140,00:00:40.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So integration over omega of f squared dx is bounded, so less than infinity.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:41.400,00:00:47.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is a class of functions that defines a space because...
Dialogue: 0,00:00:47.380,00:00:51.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,defines a linear space because if f and g...
Dialogue: 0,00:00:52.080,00:00:57.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So first of all, if f is in L2 space, if you scale it by a finite number,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:57.880,00:01:01.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,the scaled function is also going to be in the same space
Dialogue: 0,00:01:01.480,00:01:05.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,because the integral of a square is just going to be also scaled by a constant.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:06.920,00:01:11.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Also, if you have f and g within both within L2,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:11.440,00:01:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,then integration of f plus g squared dx,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:16.980,00:01:24.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,we have f squared plus 2fg plus g squared dx.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:26.060,00:01:26.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:26.400,00:01:27.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,And using...
Dialogue: 0,00:01:27.880,00:01:30.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,Using Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:31.340,00:01:35.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,the integration of fg dx is less or equal to...
Dialogue: 0,00:01:37.640,00:01:44.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well, half of integration of f squared plus g squared, right, dx.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:45.180,00:01:46.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,And therefore, this...
Dialogue: 0,00:01:46.820,00:01:49.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,If the integration of f squared is finite,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:50.100,00:01:51.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,integration of g squared is finite,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:51.860,00:01:55.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,then the integration of this and this and this are all finite.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:55.860,00:01:57.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Therefore, this is going to be...
Dialogue: 0,00:01:57.880,00:01:59.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,Less than...
Dialogue: 0,00:01:59.600,00:02:06.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is going to be less than infinity if f and g both are square integrable.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:07.000,00:02:14.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is basically a proof that shows that the L2 space is a linear space.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:16.100,00:02:17.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Satisfying the criterion.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:19.160,00:02:23.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if f is in...
Dialogue: 0,00:02:23.660,00:02:27.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's say if f and g both in L2 space,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:27.880,00:02:34.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,then af plus bg is also in the same space.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:35.040,00:02:39.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because scaling doesn't change...
Dialogue: 0,00:02:39.600,00:02:44.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean, scaling a member in the space cannot go out of the...
Dialogue: 0,00:02:44.640,00:02:47.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,Cannot cause the member to go out of the space.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:47.460,00:02:49.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,And also linear combination cannot...
Dialogue: 0,00:02:49.680,00:02:52.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,Summation cannot force the member to go out of the space.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:53.800,00:02:53.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:54.760,00:02:57.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the Sobolev space is an extension of this.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:58.380,00:03:02.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the Sobolev space, we're only going to be talking about h1 here.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:03.380,00:03:10.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the extension to h2, etc., we can see later,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:11.060,00:03:15.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,is that all the functions f, such that the integral...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:15.280,00:03:16.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm also going to define omega here.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:16.840,00:03:22.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,The integral of not only f, but also the derivative of f.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:23.160,00:03:26.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let me just call it gradient of f.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:27.300,00:03:27.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's fine.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:27.860,00:03:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's finite.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:29.120,00:03:31.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,In one dimension, this gradient is just the df dx.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:32.840,00:03:36.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is basically because both f squared and the gradient f squared,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:36.880,00:03:37.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,they are positive.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:37.980,00:03:39.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,The sum of these is less than infinity,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:39.940,00:03:43.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,which basically means that the f is square integrable,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:44.060,00:03:46.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the derivative of f is also square integrable.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:48.000,00:03:48.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:49.400,00:03:54.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the equivalent to f...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:55.380,00:03:56.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well, f integrable is...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:57.860,00:04:02.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's the same as saying f is in L2.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:03.840,00:04:09.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the gradient of f is also in L2.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:12.300,00:04:16.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,So is it a bigger space than L2 or a smaller space than L2?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:19.680,00:04:26.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's smaller because some functions in h1 doesn't belong to L2.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:26.100,00:04:26.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:27.860,00:04:29.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,All functions in L2...
Dialogue: 0,00:04:29.340,00:04:31.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,Sorry, the opposite.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:31.980,00:04:34.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,All functions in h1 belongs to L2,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:34.280,00:04:36.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,and some functions in L2 doesn't belong to h1.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:37.320,00:04:41.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Somebody think of an example of a function in L2 doesn't belong to h1?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:48.720,00:04:52.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,A function that is in L2, but the gradient is not in L2.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:53.660,00:04:55.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Something on the vertical line?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:55.540,00:04:57.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,Something on the vertical line?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:57.340,00:04:57.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,Something on the vertical line?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:57.400,00:04:59.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,Like, so you have a...
Dialogue: 0,00:04:59.100,00:05:01.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:01.900,00:05:04.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,Something that has a vertical line.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:05.000,00:05:06.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Something that has a vertical line.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:06.580,00:05:06.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:07.140,00:05:08.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,So a function like that.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:08.680,00:05:09.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:09.260,00:05:10.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's a very good example.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:11.300,00:05:12.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's a...
Dialogue: 0,00:05:12.700,00:05:15.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,We have a function that is discontinuous.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:15.380,00:05:15.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:15.660,00:05:18.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,So a function that is discontinuous belongs to L2,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:18.780,00:05:21.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,but doesn't belong to h1.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:21.500,00:05:21.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:22.360,00:05:23.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's a good point.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:23.860,00:05:25.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So discontinuous...
Dialogue: 0,00:05:27.400,00:05:29.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,function...
Dialogue: 0,00:05:29.400,00:05:33.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,can belong to L2, but not h1.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:33.800,00:05:36.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Another example is f equal to square root of x
Dialogue: 0,00:05:36.880,00:05:40.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,for x in 0 and 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:41.460,00:05:43.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,Of course, the function is square integrable.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:43.900,00:05:44.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Square is just x.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:45.120,00:05:45.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:45.700,00:05:49.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,But the derivative is 1 over square root of x.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:49.680,00:05:51.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean, half of 1 over square root of x.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:52.620,00:05:54.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,Square root, you get 1 over x,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:54.520,00:05:56.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,and it's not integrable within 0 and 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:57.400,00:06:00.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean, the derivative is infinite at 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:01.640,00:06:02.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:03.820,00:06:04.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:04.340,00:06:12.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,So both of these are in L2, but not h1.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:13.720,00:06:16.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we can define all other h's,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:16.520,00:06:20.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,like h2 is f's,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:21.100,00:06:25.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,whose square, the function itself,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:26.960,00:06:27.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,and...
Dialogue: 0,00:06:27.400,00:06:30.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,and also, like, the squares...
Dialogue: 0,00:06:30.300,00:06:37.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,the second order derivative also has to be finite.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:38.320,00:06:40.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now it's an even smaller space.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:41.200,00:06:41.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:41.400,00:06:43.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,So as you increase this index,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:44.060,00:06:46.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,more and more derivatives are required to be
Dialogue: 0,00:06:46.760,00:06:49.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,not only exist, but also square integrable.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:49.120,00:06:50.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you get more...
Dialogue: 0,00:06:50.340,00:06:51.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,smaller and smaller space.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:55.160,00:06:56.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is...
Dialogue: 0,00:06:56.440,00:06:57.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,the...
Dialogue: 0,00:06:57.400,00:06:58.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,and also it's...
Dialogue: 0,00:06:58.520,00:07:02.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's more than just differentiable, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:02.260,00:07:04.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because square root of x, for example,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:04.500,00:07:05.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's actually c infinity.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:05.980,00:07:06.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's...
Dialogue: 0,00:07:06.260,00:07:06.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's...
Dialogue: 0,00:07:06.640,00:07:10.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's going to be differentiable always.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:10.600,00:07:11.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,But, like, it's...
Dialogue: 0,00:07:11.580,00:07:13.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,it doesn't even belong to h1.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:14.120,00:07:14.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,So...
Dialogue: 0,00:07:14.520,00:07:15.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,so...
Dialogue: 0,00:07:15.020,00:07:17.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,so functions that are not just differentiable,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:17.220,00:07:19.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,but its derivative are...
Dialogue: 0,00:07:20.260,00:07:23.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,cannot go to infinity too fast at the boundaries.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:25.120,00:07:25.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
