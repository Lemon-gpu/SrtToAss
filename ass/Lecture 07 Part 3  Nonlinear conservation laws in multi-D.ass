Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:04.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,The whole conservation law actually generalizes to multiple dimensions.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:05.960,00:00:15.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's start with the conservative form of conservation law in multiple dimensions.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:15.960,00:00:21.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,We have partial u, partial t, plus, now we have multiple axes.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:21.960,00:00:24.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,We have x and y and z, for example.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:24.180,00:00:34.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,But no matter how big the dimension we have, we can write it as the divergence of a flux vector.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:35.460,00:00:44.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Where the flux now is not a scalar flux, as it should be, a vector in two or three dimensional space.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:45.820,00:00:52.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,And it's the divergence of that vector that determines the time evolution of that solution u.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:53.180,00:00:54.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,And of course...
Dialogue: 0,00:00:54.180,00:01:05.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Of course the primitive form is taking chain rule on this second term.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:07.020,00:01:18.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,And taking chain rule, we get df vector du, a scalar, dot with the gradient of u.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:19.700,00:01:21.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,That is equal to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:23.180,00:01:24.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,And again...
Dialogue: 0,00:01:24.180,00:01:29.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is a wave speed, except for now my wave speed is a vector.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:30.500,00:01:38.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,It not only denotes how fast locally the wave at that also it determines towards which direction
Dialogue: 0,00:01:39.020,00:01:40.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,does the wave
Dialogue: 0,00:01:40.700,00:01:42.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,propagate.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:42.660,00:01:46.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, and we also have the integral form.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:49.380,00:01:51.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,The integral form again is
Dialogue: 0,00:01:52.500,00:01:54.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,derived by integrating
Dialogue: 0,00:01:54.180,00:01:58.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,over any domain, any continuous domain,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:00.180,00:02:02.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,this differential equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:09.020,00:02:14.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for example in 3D space, this is going to be dv, d volume, is equal to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:15.680,00:02:17.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, and
Dialogue: 0,00:02:18.440,00:02:24.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,first of all, let's integrate the first term and move the differential to time out.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:24.180,00:02:28.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, if we take the third term and move it to the third term, we have integral of dv, dv, dv, dv.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:28.440,00:02:36.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,So again, if u is density in three dimension, this is the total mass encompassed in this volume omega.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:38.880,00:02:39.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,The second term...
Dialogue: 0,00:02:41.440,00:02:46.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,We can't use directly a fundamental theorem of calculus.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:47.600,00:02:48.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, Gauss's theorem.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:48.920,00:02:54.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the integral of a volume of a divergence is equal to what?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:54.180,00:02:56.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,Surface integral.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:56.180,00:03:04.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is equal to a surface integral exactly over, let me denote partial omega as the surface encompassing the volume,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:04.740,00:03:07.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,dot a normal vector ds,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:08.860,00:03:13.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,where this is a surface integral over the surface, is equal to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:17.680,00:03:23.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you write it the other way, just to put a minus sign on the second term and move it towards the right hand side, it's
Dialogue: 0,00:03:24.180,00:03:25.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,equal to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:25.180,00:03:26.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, we can see that...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:26.180,00:03:31.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,And for example, I think it's easier to move the minus sign to here, so that we have a minus n.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:31.180,00:03:40.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, n, the normal in Gauss's theorem is unit normal pointing outwards or inwards?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:40.180,00:03:41.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,Outwards.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:41.180,00:03:42.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,Outwards.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:42.180,00:03:47.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, minus n is going to be a unit normal pointing inwards, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:47.180,00:03:52.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,That means the rate of change of the total mass is going to be a unit normal pointing inwards.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:52.180,00:03:52.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:52.680,00:03:53.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:53.180,00:03:53.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:53.680,00:04:01.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, the total mass inside the volume is equal to the flux, is equal to the total flux into the volume.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:01.680,00:04:02.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:03.680,00:04:12.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Of course, the f can have the opposite sign, can point towards the different direction as minus n, the inside of the volume.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:12.680,00:04:16.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,In that case, f represents a flux out of the volume.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:17.680,00:04:22.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,If f is aligned, has a positive inner product with minus n,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:22.680,00:04:24.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,f represents a flux into the volume.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:24.680,00:04:27.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:27.680,00:04:32.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, this is how the conservation law works in multiple dimensions.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:32.680,00:04:34.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any questions?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:34.680,00:04:46.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, we will shelf this multi-dimension conservation law for later on when we discuss finite volume in multiple dimensions.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:46.680,00:04:50.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,This lecture will focus on only the one-dimension scalar conservation law.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:50.680,00:04:51.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:51.680,00:04:56.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, the first thing we are going to do is to look at the scalar conservation law.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:56.680,00:05:02.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the purpose of this is for us to have an intuitive understanding of how the solution in 1D looks like,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:02.680,00:05:06.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,and for us to derive our finite volume scheme.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:06.680,00:05:08.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:08.680,00:05:10.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Question?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:10.680,00:05:17.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Are the Fibonacci and the conservative equations saying something different physically, or is it just a matter of . . . ?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:17.680,00:05:18.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
