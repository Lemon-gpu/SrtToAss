Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:04.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,An example I want to give is the so-called wave equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:05.880,00:00:12.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the wave equation doesn't look like a system of equations in the beginning, but somehow it is.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:13.060,00:00:19.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,The wave equation is an equation involving a second-order derivative in time.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:19.980,00:00:27.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so if we have a first-order derivative, it is the heat equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:28.220,00:00:30.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,It is a parabolic equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:31.200,00:00:35.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,It means the function u is going to diffuse out after time.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:36.360,00:00:41.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,But if we have a second-order derivative in time, the equation behaves completely differently.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:44.040,00:00:49.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,To see that, let us use two auxiliary equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:49.980,00:00:55.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's do phi and psi.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:57.040,00:00:59.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's introduce these two variables.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:59.760,00:01:10.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,And phi is defined as the derivative of u to t, and psi is defined as the derivative of u to x.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:12.160,00:01:16.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, first of all, just by their definition,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:18.000,00:01:19.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,we know that partial heat is going to be equal to the derivative of u to t.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:19.960,00:01:19.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we know that partial heat is going to be equal to the derivative of u to x.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:19.980,00:01:28.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we know that partial psi, partial t, is equal to the partial square of u, partial x, partial t, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:28.320,00:01:29.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,Just by definition of psi.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:30.500,00:01:38.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,Which is actually equal to partial phi, partial x, also by the definition of phi.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:38.860,00:01:42.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's one equation we obtained through the definition.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:42.280,00:01:42.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:48.000,00:01:49.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Another equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:49.980,00:01:52.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,Another equation we can obtain is from the equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:52.980,00:02:02.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the equation partial square u, partial t square can be written as a time derivative of a time derivative,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:03.180,00:02:05.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is time derivative of phi.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:07.300,00:02:14.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,It is equal to the spatial derivative of u,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:14.940,00:02:19.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is spatial derivative of spatial derivative, that is, partial psi.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:19.300,00:02:20.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Partial x.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:20.300,00:02:23.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:23.300,00:02:28.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, we have these two equations, and we can write them down together.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:28.300,00:02:32.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Partial psi, partial t is partial phi, partial x.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:32.300,00:02:36.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Partial phi, partial t is equal to partial psi, partial x.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:38.300,00:02:40.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,What an interesting system.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:41.300,00:02:46.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,It corresponds to our previous example where this matrix,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:47.300,00:02:48.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,where this matrix,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:49.300,00:02:55.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,u11, u12, u21, u22 is equal to what?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:59.300,00:03:05.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,0, 0, because the psi time derivative does not depend on psi spatial derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:05.300,00:03:08.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the phi time derivative doesn't depend on phi spatial derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:08.300,00:03:10.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,They only have a coupling term.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:11.300,00:03:13.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,And it's minus 1, minus 1 here, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:13.300,00:03:18.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any questions about the derivation from the wave equation?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:18.300,00:03:22.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,From the wave equation to the system of two equations we are solving here?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:27.300,00:03:28.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,No?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:30.300,00:03:31.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:32.300,00:03:37.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,And what are the eigenvalues of that matrix?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:41.300,00:03:45.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Of course, I don't expect you to do that mentally.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:45.300,00:03:49.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,But if you just file MATLAB,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:52.300,00:03:55.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's minus 1 and 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:02.300,00:04:09.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, the eigenvalues of this matrix is minus 1 and 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:09.300,00:04:13.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,And remember our stability analysis.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:13.300,00:04:26.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,The lambda k1 would be then equal to our e to the jk delta x minus e to the minus jk delta x
Dialogue: 0,00:04:26.300,00:04:29.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,divided by 2 delta x times 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:29.300,00:04:37.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Lambda k2 would be equal to the same thing times minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:39.300,00:04:40.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:40.300,00:04:41.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:41.300,00:04:50.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if you write the exponential of complex of purely imaginary numbers into sines and cosines,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:50.300,00:04:56.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,you're going to find them to be purely imaginary numbers.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:56.300,00:05:03.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,They go like that all the way to, let me see, this is 1 minus 1 divided by delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:03.300,00:05:10.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,They go all the way to 1 over delta x times, this is imaginary axis.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:10.300,00:05:12.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is real axis.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:12.300,00:05:17.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,And they go also all the way to minus 1 over delta x on the imaginary axis.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:17.300,00:05:23.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, all the eigenvalues of both lambda k1 and lambda k2 lies in that region.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:26.300,00:05:27.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:29.300,00:05:33.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, we need something not forward order.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:33.300,00:05:37.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,We need a Rangakala scheme or something else so that we have a stability region
Dialogue: 0,00:05:37.300,00:05:41.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,that encompasses the imaginary axis.
