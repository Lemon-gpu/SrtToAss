Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,of non-trivial boundary conditions. Alright, so let's go back to our simpler case of
Dialogue: 0,00:00:08.000,00:00:25.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,f equal to 1. So let's do this, which makes our right-hand side equal to 1. And let's use a
Dialogue: 0,00:00:25.520,00:00:36.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,boundary condition that is x. So the solution u on the left-hand side, let's say, is equal to 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:37.360,00:00:47.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what does that make a difference? So now if we have a solution u also equal to,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:49.280,00:00:55.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,that is non-zero at the first grid point, what we have is we also have a u0 which is
Dialogue: 0,00:00:55.520,00:01:02.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,non times phi0 of x. Let's say phi0 is the half-hat function that is equal to 1 at the left
Dialogue: 0,00:01:02.480,00:01:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,boundary and equal to 0 at all the interior grid points. So what happens is that
Dialogue: 0,00:01:12.400,00:01:18.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,because the test function, because the phij's, the v's are still going to be zero at the boundaries,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:18.080,00:01:24.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,so the integration by parts still come out to be the same with no boundary terms. But
Dialogue: 0,00:01:24.160,00:01:32.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,in addition, there is going to be a term that is minus integration of a and b,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:32.240,00:01:44.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is very similar to this term but with a known u0 times partial phi0, partial x,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:44.560,00:01:53.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,times partial phi1, not partial phi1, partial phij, partial x. And this is going to combine with
Dialogue: 0,00:01:54.160,00:02:01.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,the right-hand side into the bj. And last lecture we analyzed this term and say this term is only
Dialogue: 0,00:02:01.920,00:02:12.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,non-zero for j equal to what? This is non-zero only for j equal to 1 because phi0 is only non-zero
Dialogue: 0,00:02:12.400,00:02:19.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,in one of the intervals. Okay, so let's, and the value of this is the same as one of the terms in
Dialogue: 0,00:02:20.080,00:02:22.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,aij, right? So,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:24.160,00:02:33.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,so what we need to change is simply b1 is equal to b1 minus, well, this term itself is negative
Dialogue: 0,00:02:33.360,00:02:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,because d phi0 dx is negative, d phi, j dx is going to be positive where j is equal to 1, so it's
Dialogue: 0,00:02:42.000,00:02:50.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,a downward slope plus a upward slope. So minus and minus cancels, we get an addition here, so it's
Dialogue: 0,00:02:50.560,00:02:53.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,going to be plus,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:54.160,00:03:04.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,1 over x2 minus x1, right? So this is the additional term we have in the right-hand side
Dialogue: 0,00:03:04.080,00:03:12.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,due to the boundary condition. So now we have, the a is not changed, so we have u is equal to a back
Dialogue: 0,00:03:12.640,00:03:21.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,slash b, all right? And now let's plot the solution, close all, plot.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:24.160,00:03:26.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's plot the solution, close all, plot.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:26.560,00:03:37.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Our plot x, instead of 0u1 we have 1u0. Instead of 0u0 we have 1u0 because the left side is 1 now,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:37.760,00:03:43.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,right? So let's plot this. This is our solution, still on a very irregular grid.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:45.920,00:03:52.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,And let's see how good the solution is. The analytical form of the function is like this. So,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:52.560,00:03:54.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,so by setting a left-hand side, we can plot the solution. So, so by setting a left-hand side,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:54.080,00:04:12.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,one dash connect under all nodes is 1. By putting one dash with a math
Dialogue: 0,00:04:14.800,00:04:17.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,feature between left and, and I put v1 in between the two dash,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:18.720,00:04:21.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,and v1 can be equivalently legal by the sequence of the transform, the substitution.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:21.360,00:04:22.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,What we get then is the semisués. Right? One dash and half 게 the sum.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:22.200,00:04:23.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right? And now what we have is our solution, plus, and that's what we've been doing all very wrong to bring up here.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:23.420,00:04:23.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So at that point we can just tease this line for the time being. And this is what we're uh important everything lists for,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:23.540,00:04:23.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,basically this is a base function, one, and one, and then we have a divisor of 2 nuclear Department, we have a B�� situational.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:23.680,00:04:28.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,so it doesn't affect the second order derivative so we still satisfy the same
Dialogue: 0,00:04:28.360,00:04:33.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,equation but with a non-trivial boundary condition and if you combine them of
Dialogue: 0,00:04:33.680,00:04:46.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,course you get a 1 minus x times 1 plus half of x so my u-fine is equal to now
Dialogue: 0,00:04:46.360,00:04:58.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,1 plus half of x-fine times this and let's hold on plot x-fine and u-fine
Dialogue: 0,00:04:58.980,00:05:04.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,see the the blue line right now is the analytical solution and the black line
Dialogue: 0,00:05:04.120,00:05:11.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,is the numerical solution again we match pretty well all right so so we covered
Dialogue: 0,00:05:11.080,00:05:15.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,how to solve the Poisson's equation using finite element both with
Dialogue: 0,00:05:15.880,00:05:16.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,a
Dialogue: 0,00:05:16.320,00:05:16.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,solution and a solution. So now let's see how to solve the Poisson's equation using finite element both with a
Dialogue: 0,00:05:16.340,00:05:21.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,constant right-hand side and with the non-trivial function as right-hand side
Dialogue: 0,00:05:21.060,00:05:25.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,and also with non-zero boundary conditions
