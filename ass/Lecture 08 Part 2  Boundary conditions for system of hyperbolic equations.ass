Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:09.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's start with a simple example of what we analyzed before. So partial u
Dialogue: 0,00:00:09.680,00:00:16.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,partial t equal to partial v partial x and partial v partial t is equal to
Dialogue: 0,00:00:16.600,00:00:21.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,partial u partial x. So that is the equation derived out of the wave
Dialogue: 0,00:00:21.360,00:00:31.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,equation. We analyzed I think two lectures before. So once you have such
Dialogue: 0,00:00:31.560,00:00:37.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,equation and you want to discretize it in a finite domain, what is proper
Dialogue: 0,00:00:37.500,00:00:45.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,boundary condition to set? Can we use a similar characteristic analysis on that?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:45.020,00:00:50.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes? No? Does this equation have a single
Dialogue: 0,00:00:50.600,00:00:51.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,character?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:51.340,00:00:58.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Does it have characteristic speed? Does it have characteristic speed? Well let's take a look.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:58.220,00:01:05.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,One thing we can do is we can write this as partial partial t of u and v
Dialogue: 0,00:01:05.320,00:01:16.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,equal to a matrix times partial partial x of u and v. Right? The matrix is just
Dialogue: 0,00:01:16.860,00:01:20.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,one one zero zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:20.580,00:01:27.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,A way to analyze the characteristic speed of this equation is by performing
Dialogue: 0,00:01:27.340,00:01:28.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,an eigenvalue analysis...
Dialogue: 0,00:01:28.840,00:01:41.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,...to find out the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix. And what are
Dialogue: 0,00:01:41.580,00:01:46.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:46.860,00:01:47.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,One.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:47.840,00:01:48.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Royках?

Dialogue: 0,00:01:50.460,00:02:04.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,eigenvectors. So eigenvectors is basically lambda times the same vector equal to
Dialogue: 0,00:02:04.540,00:02:12.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,this times the same vector, right? So for example, if I plug in 1 and 1, what do I
Dialogue: 0,00:02:12.000,00:02:22.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,get? I get, I mean matrix vector multiplication, I get 1 and 1, right? Okay,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:22.740,00:02:29.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,so lambda is equal to 1 in that case. What if I multiply the same thing using
Dialogue: 0,00:02:29.580,00:02:40.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,1 and minus 1? Alright, matrix vector multiplication 1 times 0, 1 times minus 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:40.440,00:02:41.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,I get minus 1 here.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:41.600,00:02:49.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,1 times 1 minus 1 times 0, I get 1 here. Which is, if I pull the minus sign out of
Dialogue: 0,00:02:49.520,00:02:56.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,here, it's equal to minus 1 times the same vector, right? So I get two eigenvalues,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:56.420,00:03:02.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,1 and minus 1. The corresponding eigenvectors are 1, 1 and 1 minus 1. In
Dialogue: 0,00:03:02.300,00:03:06.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,general, it's not obvious, as obvious as this, you need to follow up MATLAB and
Dialogue: 0,00:03:06.480,00:03:11.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,put the matrix into this and call eig to figure out what are the eigenvalues I
Dialogue: 0,00:03:11.120,00:03:11.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,I
Dialogue: 0,00:03:11.540,00:03:11.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,I
Dialogue: 0,00:03:11.580,00:03:18.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,have to find the eigenvectors. But in this case, it's just a 1 minus 1, and we can use
Dialogue: 0,00:03:18.080,00:03:22.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,these eigenvectors, use the eigenvectors to recombine this equation to perform linear
Dialogue: 0,00:03:22.800,00:03:29.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,combinations of u and v to decouple them, make them scalar equations. Why do we need
Dialogue: 0,00:03:29.420,00:03:38.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,to do that? We are doing that, we decouple these equations so that we know which linear
Dialogue: 0,00:03:38.720,00:03:41.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,combination of the,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:41.520,00:03:49.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,variables should I set on the boundary? Which other linear combination should I
Dialogue: 0,00:03:49.360,00:03:59.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,leave it alone? Okay? Because, for example, on the left boundary, on the left
Dialogue: 0,00:03:59.480,00:04:06.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,boundary, the characteristics corresponding to 1, 1, which is, let me do the analysis
Dialogue: 0,00:04:06.280,00:04:11.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,here. So this is equal to that, and so the eigenvalues, which are the eigenvalues, are
Dialogue: 0,00:04:11.460,00:04:16.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,the eigenvectors. So the eigenvalue eigenvector analysis makes it possible for me to express
Dialogue: 0,00:04:16.120,00:04:28.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,this matrix as a, as a 1 minus 1. So, so, so let me, I don't have enough space to write
Dialogue: 0,00:04:28.780,00:04:41.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,it down here. So this analysis tells me that if I multiply the same matrix 0, 1, 1, 0, times,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:41.400,00:04:47.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,not only this 1, 1 vector but also this 1 minus 1 vector. So these two columns are basically
Dialogue: 0,00:04:47.660,00:05:01.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,these two eigenvectors. This would give me, this would give me 1 and 1 on the first column
Dialogue: 0,00:05:01.080,00:05:10.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,and minus 1, 1 on the second column. But if I still write it as, if I still write it as
Dialogue: 0,00:05:10.740,00:05:11.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,this, I need to write it as 1 minus 1. So I just need to write it as 1 minus 1. And,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:11.240,00:05:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I need to multiply this column by minus 1, which can be done by, which can be done by
Dialogue: 0,00:05:18.000,00:05:25.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,1, 1, 1 minus 1. If I want to multiply the first column by 1, I want to put a 1 here.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:25.820,00:05:30.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,If I want to multiply the second column by minus 1, I put a minus 1 here. Right? So this
Dialogue: 0,00:05:30.740,00:05:37.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,is the proper representation of these, these eigenvalue eigenvectors in matrix. So we want
Dialogue: 0,00:05:37.320,00:05:40.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,to insert this matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:40.580,00:05:50.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,Onto here. So what we want to do is we want to multiply this by 1, 1, 1 minus 1 times
Dialogue: 0,00:05:50.600,00:06:02.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,1, 1, 1 minus 1 inverse. Right? Partial, partial t of u, v is equal to the, the matrix
Dialogue: 0,00:06:02.840,00:06:09.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,times the first matrix is exactly the right hand side of this eigenvalue eigenvector relation.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:09.320,00:06:09.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it is going to be equal to the first matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:09.920,00:06:18.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And it is going to be equal to the, to this 1, 1, 1 minus 1 times 1 minus 1. So this is
Dialogue: 0,00:06:18.960,00:06:24.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,equal to the left hand side. And I still have an inverse over here. So I still have a 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:24.300,00:06:38.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,1, 1 minus 1 inverse times partial, partial x of u and v. So there is an inverse here.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:38.040,00:06:39.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if I move.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:39.920,00:06:42.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,This matrix two to the left hand
Dialogue: 0,00:06:42.360,00:06:48.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,side. What I get is a partial partial tee
Dialogue: 0,00:06:48.800,00:06:54.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,off. Let me see if I can compute the.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:54.620,00:06:58.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,Inverse, a, easily, so the inverse this matrix is.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:58.900,00:07:02.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,The, the determinant is 1 minus 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:02.160,00:07:04.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is minus minus one séins 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:04.100,00:07:08.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,so determinant it's minus two inverse of this matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:08.240,00:07:09.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,I should-.,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:09.120,00:07:16.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,should be the 1 over determinant times...
Dialogue: 0,00:07:16.120,00:07:20.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I want to switch these.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:20.120,00:07:26.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I still have 1, I still have 1, minus 1 and 1 here. Is that right?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:29.120,00:07:35.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,No, that's not right. I think I still have 1 here, minus 1 here.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:35.120,00:07:41.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,If I take the inverse of the matrix, multiply it on the left-hand side and right-hand side of both equations,

Dialogue: 0,00:08:05.120,00:08:10.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Partial x. I also multiply the inverse inside this.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:10.120,00:08:14.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Half of u plus v, half of u minus v.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:14.120,00:08:15.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:15.120,00:08:22.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is how we can use the eigenvectors to decouple this equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:23.120,00:08:27.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So u plus v over 2 is...
Dialogue: 0,00:08:27.120,00:08:32.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,The time derivative is only a function of u plus v over 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:32.120,00:08:34.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,The time derivative of u minus v over 2 is...
Dialogue: 0,00:08:34.120,00:08:42.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Only a function of the same function, u minus v over 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:42.120,00:08:49.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the first component, u plus v over 2, propagates at a characteristic speed of plus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:49.120,00:08:54.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,The other component, u minus v over 2, propagates at a characteristic speed of minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:54.120,00:08:58.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So one goes towards the right, one goes towards the left.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:58.120,00:09:03.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let me impose the boundary condition at x equal to 0.

Dialogue: 0,00:09:18.120,00:09:19.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:19.120,00:09:21.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Specify for u plus v.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:21.120,00:09:25.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Specify for u plus v, which propagates towards the right.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:25.120,00:09:26.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:26.120,00:09:29.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,And u minus v should be left alone.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:29.120,00:09:30.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Can u though?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:30.120,00:09:33.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Suppose I only have information about the function u.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:33.120,00:09:37.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,What should I do?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:37.120,00:09:41.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,I know u minus v should be left alone, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:41.120,00:09:47.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I can compute what is locally u minus v.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:47.120,00:09:53.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,And now if I have the function u, if I have information about function u,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:53.120,00:09:59.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I have the value of u minus v over 2, which comes from inside the domain,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:59.120,00:10:03.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,then I know what to set about u plus v.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:03.120,00:10:04.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:04.120,00:10:13.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the value u minus v, I should grab the information from inside the domain.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:13.120,00:10:19.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,I have value of u, which I know what it is.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:19.120,00:10:24.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,That allows me to set what is u plus v.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:24.120,00:10:29.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,And again on the right, I have information, let's say again I have information of u,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:29.120,00:10:31.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I know what is the value of u plus v from inside the domain.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:31.120,00:10:32.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:32.120,00:10:37.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,That allows me to set u minus v over 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:37.120,00:10:38.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Good question.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:38.120,00:10:41.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you have, if you are doing finite difference scheme,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:41.120,00:10:46.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,you know what is the value on the first grid point inside the domain.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:46.120,00:10:47.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:47.120,00:10:51.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So depending on how many order of, what is the order of accuracy you want to achieve,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:51.120,00:10:57.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,you can either just take the value of one, like one grid point inside the domain,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:57.120,00:11:01.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,or you can take several values and interpolate or extrapolate.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:01.120,00:11:02.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
