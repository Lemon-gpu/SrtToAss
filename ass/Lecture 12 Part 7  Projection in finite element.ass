Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:05.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think in your project 1, a lot of you are formulating your problem into optimization problems.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:06.480,00:00:11.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,And for those of you who were not lucky and you formulated your objective function,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:11.820,00:00:15.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,if you formulated your problem into a very high-dimensional optimization problem,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:16.080,00:00:20.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,you notice that the optimization problem can be very difficult to solve.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:21.220,00:00:24.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Low-dimensional optimization problem with a few parameters,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:24.560,00:00:32.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,for example, if my n is equal to 2, I should be able to solve these problems with no difficulty.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:32.480,00:00:40.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,But you can imagine for very complex functions, I may need a large n to have a good approximation.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:40.740,00:00:45.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's not trivial how to solve general optimization problems of high dimensions.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:46.260,00:00:52.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,But if I define the distance in a particularly good way,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:53.160,00:00:54.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,the optimization problem...
Dialogue: 0,00:00:54.560,00:00:56.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,can turn out to be very easy to solve.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:58.380,00:01:04.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, for example, if I define the distance between two functions f and x to be the following.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:06.020,00:01:15.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,To be the square root of the integral over domain, let's say a and b, f minus x squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:17.080,00:01:18.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Maybe I shouldn't use x here.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:18.840,00:01:22.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,So f and g, let's say, dx.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:24.560,00:01:25.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Square root.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:27.840,00:01:33.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right, that's the least squares distance, right, between the functions f and g.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:35.840,00:01:49.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so if I want to minimize over all the possible g's that is in the space big X,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:49.880,00:01:53.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,that kind of minimization is called...
Dialogue: 0,00:01:54.560,00:01:55.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,a projection.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:57.560,00:01:59.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because it is looking for the minimum...
Dialogue: 0,00:02:04.560,00:02:10.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because it is looking for the minimum distance in the L2 sense between f and g.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:10.060,00:02:13.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's figure out why is it called projection.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:16.560,00:02:19.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,It is called projection because of the following.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:19.560,00:02:23.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let me say I have one point in space.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:23.060,00:02:24.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's say this point.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:24.560,00:02:26.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Like the tip of my pen.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:26.560,00:02:28.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the space I want to...
Dialogue: 0,00:02:28.560,00:02:32.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,The space of g in which I want to...
Dialogue: 0,00:02:32.560,00:02:34.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's say this is f.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:34.560,00:02:35.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:35.560,00:02:36.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I want to find a g within...
Dialogue: 0,00:02:36.560,00:02:40.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,On the table that has a minimum distance to g.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:40.560,00:02:42.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,How should I find it?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:43.560,00:02:49.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,What is the special relation of that minimum distance g with f?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:51.560,00:02:52.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:52.560,00:03:01.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, I can just drop my pen and the point on which it lands is that g, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:02.560,00:03:05.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or in other sense, I'm drawing an orthogonal...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:05.560,00:03:08.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm drawing a line that is orthogonal.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:08.560,00:03:14.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,I start with f and I go into the space in an orthogonal way.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:15.560,00:03:17.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Once I hit the space, I find g.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:18.560,00:03:19.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:19.560,00:03:20.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's that simple.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:20.560,00:03:21.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:21.560,00:03:26.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the orthogonality can be expressed like that.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:26.560,00:03:29.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Orthogonality to a space...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:29.560,00:03:37.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's say if I go from f to g, that is g minus f.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:37.560,00:03:40.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,g minus f is the vector from f to g, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:42.560,00:03:47.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,The vector from f to g is orthogonal to the space x.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:47.560,00:03:55.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's defined as for any g prime in x,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:55.560,00:04:04.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,g minus f times g prime is integrated to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:04.560,00:04:08.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's the meaning of orthogonality.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:08.560,00:04:10.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the reason is the following.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:10.560,00:04:15.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if I find a particular g that minimizes that distance,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:15.560,00:04:21.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,it also minimizes the squared distance.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:21.560,00:04:24.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,That should be pretty obvious.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:26.560,00:04:27.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:28.560,00:04:30.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,And so let me just call this g star
Dialogue: 0,00:04:30.560,00:04:35.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,because g is the result of this optimization problem.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:36.560,00:04:40.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So then for any g, I can express...
Dialogue: 0,00:04:40.560,00:04:43.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's define...
Dialogue: 0,00:04:45.560,00:04:49.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So g star is the minimizer.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:49.560,00:04:55.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's define g prime being the distance between g and g star.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:55.560,00:05:01.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then this can be represented as integral of f minus g,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:01.560,00:05:05.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is equal to g prime plus g star.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:05.560,00:05:07.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:07.560,00:05:08.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:08.560,00:05:11.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,g prime minus g...
Dialogue: 0,00:05:11.560,00:05:14.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So yeah, g is equal to g prime plus g star.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:14.560,00:05:16.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,d x.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:16.560,00:05:20.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that, because of the property of the square,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:20.560,00:05:22.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,that's very special.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:22.560,00:05:26.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's why we design our objective function to be f minus g square.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:26.560,00:05:32.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,I can expand this into f minus g star square
Dialogue: 0,00:05:32.560,00:05:39.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,minus 2g prime times f minus g star
Dialogue: 0,00:05:39.560,00:05:42.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,plus g prime square.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:42.560,00:05:43.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,d x.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:44.560,00:05:46.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:46.560,00:05:50.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm just expanding these perfect squares.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:52.560,00:05:53.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:53.560,00:05:56.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,And you can see that this term,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:56.560,00:05:58.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,because of g prime square integrated,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:58.560,00:06:00.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,is always greater than zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:00.560,00:06:04.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So as long as I can make the second term
Dialogue: 0,00:06:04.560,00:06:07.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,to be equal to zero...
Dialogue: 0,00:06:07.560,00:06:13.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if integration of a times g of g prime
Dialogue: 0,00:06:13.560,00:06:17.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,times f minus g star d x is equal to zero,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:17.560,00:06:22.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,then the left-hand side is always greater than this.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:22.560,00:06:29.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,f minus g square d x is equal to integration of a and b,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:29.560,00:06:37.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,f minus g star square d x plus g prime square d x.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:37.560,00:06:41.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is always greater than this,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:41.560,00:06:45.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,and it is only equal when g prime is equal to zero everywhere.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:45.560,00:06:47.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:47.560,00:06:49.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Almost everywhere.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:49.560,00:06:52.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that means
Dialogue: 0,00:06:52.560,00:06:57.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,if I can have this equal to zero for any g prime
Dialogue: 0,00:06:57.560,00:07:00.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,in that linear space,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:00.560,00:07:03.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,then I know that f...
Dialogue: 0,00:07:03.560,00:07:07.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,I know that g star is the minimizer
Dialogue: 0,00:07:07.560,00:07:09.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,of this distance function,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:09.560,00:07:11.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,distance square, distance function.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:11.560,00:07:13.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let me write that down.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:13.560,00:07:15.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So...
Dialogue: 0,00:07:15.560,00:07:18.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Which is also saying that
Dialogue: 0,00:07:18.560,00:07:24.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,g star minimizes
Dialogue: 0,00:07:24.560,00:07:29.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,the squared distance function
Dialogue: 0,00:07:29.560,00:07:35.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,among all the g's in the linear space.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:35.560,00:07:36.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:36.560,00:07:37.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what I have done,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:37.560,00:07:40.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,I have transformed the optimization problem.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:41.560,00:07:45.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,To an equality problem.

Dialogue: 0,00:07:48.560,00:07:54.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the optimization problem...
