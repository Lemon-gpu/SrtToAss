Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:03.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's first construct the diagonal block.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:05.260,00:00:07.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so first of all, how big are they?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:08.720,00:00:11.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,How big is each of these diagonal blocks?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:14.040,00:00:16.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,ny minus 1 by ny minus 1, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:17.040,00:00:21.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so let's first construct these entries on the diagonal.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:22.040,00:00:27.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,So before we do that, we need to compute dx is equal to 1 over nx minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:27.980,00:00:32.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,dy is equal to 1 over ny minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:34.160,00:00:52.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,So my diagonal block is going to be identity of ny minus 1 times minus 2 divided by delta x squared minus 2 divided by delta y squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:52.100,00:00:56.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right, so my diagonal block.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:57.980,00:01:01.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is just like that for now.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:03.560,00:01:09.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so I need to field in the upper and lower diagonals by 1 over delta y squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:10.000,00:01:13.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to teach you a different trick as I did last time.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:14.520,00:01:22.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is equal to diagonal block plus a diagonal entry of 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:22.760,00:01:26.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So first of all, how many entries do they have?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:27.980,00:01:32.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,They have two entries, which is ny minus 2, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:34.760,00:01:42.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,So first of all, I construct the ones of ny minus 2 rows and one column.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:42.700,00:01:47.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's basically a column vector of ny minus 1 ones.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:48.120,00:01:51.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm going to divide it by delta y squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:51.460,00:01:57.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so I get the same size of row vectors of 1 over delta y squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:57.980,00:01:59.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm going to make it.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:59.800,00:02:00.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm going to.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:00.500,00:02:01.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the second.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:01.620,00:02:04.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is the first entry of the argument for diagonal.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:04.980,00:02:06.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,The second entry is 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:06.580,00:02:08.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,That means I don't want the exact diagonal.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:08.860,00:02:10.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,I want it to be shifted to the.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:11.660,00:02:13.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think 1 is upper diagonal.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:13.620,00:02:14.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm not sure.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:14.120,00:02:14.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's take a look.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:15.480,00:02:15.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:16.560,00:02:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,You see, this upper diagonal has changed to 9.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:20.680,00:02:24.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,Which is 1 over delta y squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:25.760,00:02:26.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:26.920,00:02:27.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that works.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:28.280,00:02:30.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now I need to fill in the lower diagonals.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:30.800,00:02:31.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,What should I do?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:32.980,00:02:34.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Minus 1 on this.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:34.840,00:02:37.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to use the same command here.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:38.100,00:02:41.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,But the second argument to diagonal is going to be minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:41.380,00:02:45.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that helps me fill out the lower diagonal entries.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:46.460,00:02:46.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:49.660,00:02:50.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:50.360,00:02:52.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now I get a diagonal block like that.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:54.380,00:02:57.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,How many of these diagonal blocks do I need to have?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:57.980,00:02:59.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because we can limit them to holes bit Ooo.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:00.300,00:03:02.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I can cup generated twohoods.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:03.140,00:03:03.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's it.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:04.780,00:03:04.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:05.040,00:03:05.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's continue reading.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:05.720,00:03:06.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's see this.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:06.380,00:03:07.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's take a look at that.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:07.680,00:03:11.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,So usually salography command will be just greaxed.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:11.140,00:03:12.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,In that case.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:12.540,00:03:17.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,Basically, we will be reading what we need to see and how much will take into account in nat looks like alpha and 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:17.540,00:03:21.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then we in the sample.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:22.000,00:03:24.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,We just inherited same approach to theaken.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:24.540,00:03:27.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,But instead of just talking about how could I methodically sporty trong the default method?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:27.140,00:03:27.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:27.380,00:03:35.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if A is an identity matrix, B is this 2x2 matrix of 1, minus 1, minus 1, 1s.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:36.260,00:03:44.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,Doing a crown of A and B is going to put the matrix B in a diagonal format of,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:45.480,00:03:49.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,basically repeat B by 4 times and put them on diagonals.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:50.820,00:03:54.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you look at this example and think of our case, what should we do?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:54.960,00:03:59.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Which matrix is our B? Which matrix is our A in this case?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:04.140,00:04:09.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,And yeah, B is going to be this matrix we just constructed, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:09.260,00:04:13.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,We want to put that as blocks, blocks, blocks, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:14.400,00:04:17.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,And A is identity.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:17.220,00:04:24.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's say my big matrix is equal to,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:24.960,00:04:31.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,crown of identity of nx minus 1 and this diagonal block.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:34.600,00:04:37.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now let's take a look at our big matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:38.300,00:04:44.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have a block over here, we have a block over here, and a block over here, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:44.800,00:04:45.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,Perfect.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:46.220,00:04:49.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have completed construction of the blocks.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:50.060,00:04:53.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,And now we need to add the upper and lower diagonals.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:54.960,00:04:56.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what should we do?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:56.960,00:05:00.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,The lower diagonal of B1 delta y squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:02.960,00:05:04.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,The lower diagonal, which one?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:04.960,00:05:06.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,That lower diagonal.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:06.960,00:05:07.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,Here?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:07.460,00:05:07.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:07.960,00:05:09.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's 1 over delta x squared, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:09.960,00:05:14.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,It should be 1 over delta, or that one, B1 over delta y squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:15.960,00:05:20.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this lower diagonal is offset by ny minus 1, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:20.960,00:05:22.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you look at the grid,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:22.960,00:05:24.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's a range of, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:24.960,00:05:27.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's shifting in a zigzagging fashion.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:28.960,00:05:31.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,A shift by ny minus 1 in this case.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:31.960,00:05:34.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you go from here, you shift it by ny minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:34.960,00:05:36.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's going this, this, and this.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:37.960,00:05:42.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,It is the same as shifting the x, shifting the i index by 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:43.960,00:05:51.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this near lower and upper diagonal is shifting y, the index in y, by 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:51.960,00:05:56.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,This far lower and upper diagonal is shifting the index in x by 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:56.960,00:05:58.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it should be divided by delta x squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:59.960,00:06:00.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:01.960,00:06:03.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the way to add them,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:03.960,00:06:06.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,we can use the same command
Dialogue: 0,00:06:06.960,00:06:10.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,as we used to construct the lower and upper diagonals of the
Dialogue: 0,00:06:10.960,00:06:12.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,diagonal blocks.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:13.960,00:06:17.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Except for the size of the matrix is going to change.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:18.960,00:06:19.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:19.960,00:06:26.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's how many non-zero entries is there in the upper and lower diagonals?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:32.960,00:06:33.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's now,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:34.960,00:06:35.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's a lot bigger.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:35.960,00:06:39.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's now nx minus 2 times ny minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:39.960,00:06:40.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:41.960,00:06:45.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So they correspond to blocks of ny minus 1 sizes.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:45.960,00:06:48.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And there are nx minus 2, one of them.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:49.960,00:06:51.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'll put this at 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:51.960,00:06:55.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And it's also shifted, not by 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:55.960,00:06:58.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,but by ny minus 1, exactly.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:02.960,00:07:04.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now, if we look at the matrix again,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:04.960,00:07:08.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,it added an upper diagonal entry over here.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:08.960,00:07:09.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:12.960,00:07:14.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, yes.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:14.960,00:07:15.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,I forgot.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:15.960,00:07:18.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's repeat this again.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:18.960,00:07:19.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Just to reset.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:19.960,00:07:24.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I need to divide by dx squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:24.960,00:07:25.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's right.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:25.960,00:07:26.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I get nines.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:26.960,00:07:28.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And lower diagonal,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:28.960,00:07:31.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,I just need to put a minus sign on this.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:31.960,00:07:32.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:32.960,00:07:34.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I get the lower diagonal again.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:36.960,00:07:40.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So one interesting thing to visualize the matrix is
Dialogue: 0,00:07:40.960,00:07:42.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,a command called spy.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:43.960,00:07:45.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's spy on the matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:45.960,00:07:46.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:48.960,00:07:51.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you get a plot of the sparsity pattern of the matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:51.960,00:07:55.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,It tells you where in the matrix it's going to be non-zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:55.960,00:07:57.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So when the matrix gets too large,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:57.960,00:07:59.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,you won't be able to look at this again.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:59.960,00:08:01.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,But spy can still do that.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:01.960,00:08:03.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's use an example.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:03.960,00:08:07.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,nx is equal to 32, let's say.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:07.960,00:08:09.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,ny is equal to 32.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:09.960,00:08:12.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And let's...
Dialogue: 0,00:08:12.960,00:08:15.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Where can I look at the command line history?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:15.960,00:08:17.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now...
Dialogue: 0,00:08:17.960,00:08:21.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm going to compute this again and this again.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:21.960,00:08:23.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm going to...
Dialogue: 0,00:08:25.960,00:08:27.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,construct the diagonal blocks.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:29.960,00:08:32.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I'm going to use Kronecker product
Dialogue: 0,00:08:32.960,00:08:37.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,to construct the big matrix and add lower and upper diagonals.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:37.960,00:08:38.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:38.960,00:08:41.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I got a matrix that may be too big to look at.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:41.960,00:08:45.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,But if I can spy on the matrix again...
Dialogue: 0,00:08:47.960,00:08:49.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,What I get is this.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:49.960,00:08:51.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So...
