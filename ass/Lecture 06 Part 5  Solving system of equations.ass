Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:05.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,So today we are going to introduce to you how do we solve system of equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:05.880,00:00:10.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,System of equations is not just one differential equation but multiple
Dialogue: 0,00:00:10.440,00:00:11.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,differential equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:11.760,00:00:19.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay so it's not that much different from solving one single differential
Dialogue: 0,00:00:19.560,00:00:25.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,equation. For example, I'm going to motivate that using a very simple
Dialogue: 0,00:00:25.860,00:00:35.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,example. Partial u, partial t plus I'm going to say u11 of partial u, partial x
Dialogue: 0,00:00:35.820,00:00:45.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,plus u12 of partial v, partial x equal to 0 and partial v, partial t plus u21 of
Dialogue: 0,00:00:45.800,00:00:52.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,partial u, partial x plus u22 of partial v, partial x equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:55.860,00:01:07.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right. So the only difference from our previous case is that every equation
Dialogue: 0,00:01:07.020,00:01:12.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,involves another equation. The time derivative for u involves v and the time
Dialogue: 0,00:01:12.680,00:01:20.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,derivative for v involves u. Right. So how do we solve it?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:22.720,00:01:25.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,We just do exactly the same thing as we did in the previous example.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:25.740,00:01:25.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we solve the equation, we just do exactly the same thing as we did in the previous example.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:25.840,00:01:33.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,did before the UI DT would be equal to u11 for example if you want to use
Dialogue: 0,00:01:33.020,00:01:42.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,central difference ui plus 1 minus ui minus 1 divided by 2 del x plus u12 v i
Dialogue: 0,00:01:42.940,00:01:51.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,plus 1 minus v i minus 1 2 del x and this is the same so this is
Dialogue: 0,00:01:51.520,00:01:56.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,discretization how do we perform error how do we analyze the truncation error
Dialogue: 0,00:01:56.860,00:02:02.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,of the scheme same thing right so we basically plug in Taylor series on each
Dialogue: 0,00:02:02.980,00:02:12.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,of these derivatives same thing the only difference is how to analyze stability
Dialogue: 0,00:02:12.860,00:02:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,how do we know this is gonna be a stable scheme instead of being an unstable
Dialogue: 0,00:02:20.000,00:02:20.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,scheme
Dialogue: 0,00:02:21.520,00:02:32.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,right again we have two ways to analyze stability the simplest way I would say
Dialogue: 0,00:02:32.240,00:02:37.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,is the what we discussed in the last lecture for Newman stability analysis
Dialogue: 0,00:02:37.560,00:02:50.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,right but now in this case we have a little bit more complication because let's for example just
Dialogue: 0,00:02:50.680,00:02:51.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,take this one
Dialogue: 0,00:02:51.520,00:02:59.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,and use our Fourier Series and but in this case we need to expand the Fourier
Dialogue: 0,00:02:59.900,00:03:12.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,Series both on u and v again K goes from minus n over 2 to n over 2 minus 1
Dialogue: 0,00:03:12.020,00:03:17.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,because of the aliasing of the higher frequencies back to the lower frequencies
Dialogue: 0,00:03:17.060,00:03:28.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,VI is going to be the same summation over the same range of Vk-hat, same explanation.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:28.300,00:03:43.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if we plug this in, what we get is du-hat of k dt, which is a result of substituting
Dialogue: 0,00:03:43.220,00:03:50.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,the Fourier series into the time derivative and collect the terms with regard to the same
Dialogue: 0,00:03:50.640,00:04:06.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,exponential of k, plus u11 of V-hat of k and the same thing as we did before is going to
Dialogue: 0,00:04:06.260,00:04:13.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,come in, jk-delta-x minus e to the minus jk-delta-x divided by 2-delta-x.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:13.040,00:04:13.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:13.220,00:04:18.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is actually going to be a common term also for V.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:18.860,00:04:23.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,So u12, oh sorry, this one is u, this one is V.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:26.640,00:04:28.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the same term.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:35.440,00:04:39.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, and I'm just going to write down the same equation for V.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:43.220,00:04:56.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now in this case, do we still have that very simple scalar ODE we can analyze the stability of?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:56.980,00:05:05.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,We no longer, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:05.240,00:05:12.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,We need to have a coupled ODE.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:12.400,00:05:13.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we can...
Dialogue: 0,00:05:13.060,00:05:13.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:13.120,00:05:13.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,.

Dialogue: 0,00:05:13.360,00:05:13.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:13.400,00:05:13.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:13.460,00:05:20.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,We can only look at the time derivative of these two numbers at the same time.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:20.560,00:05:31.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is actually going to be equal to a matrix times u-hat of k, V-hat of k.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:32.700,00:05:38.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that matrix involves u11, u12, u21, u22.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:39.560,00:05:42.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,It also involves the same vector.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:42.480,00:05:59.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,factor, let me just write as, not k, but ck, where ck is equal to e to the jk delta x minus
Dialogue: 0,00:05:59.660,00:06:03.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,e to the jk minus jk delta x over 2 delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:05.020,00:06:06.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:06.600,00:06:15.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, in order to ensure that the scheme is stable, what do we need to ensure about this
Dialogue: 0,00:06:15.100,00:06:15.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,whole matrix?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:18.220,00:06:20.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,The norm is less than 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:21.100,00:06:24.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,That is an excellent way to ensure the stability.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:25.920,00:06:31.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,And another excellent way to ensure the stability is look at the eigenvalues.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:33.180,00:06:34.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's talk about it.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:34.720,00:06:35.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, this is...
Dialogue: 0,00:06:35.720,00:06:45.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,If I write it as d dt of u hat of k v hat of k is equal to, let's move this to the other
Dialogue: 0,00:06:45.340,00:06:49.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,side, ak times the same vector.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:51.700,00:06:56.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,What do we know about the solution to this equation?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:59.140,00:07:05.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,The solution to this equation can be derived analytically by factorizing.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:05.720,00:07:09.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, let's look at the solution to this matrix and its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:09.560,00:07:14.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,If we say ak is equal to...
Dialogue: 0,00:07:16.740,00:07:17.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,What is...
Dialogue: 0,00:07:18.160,00:07:20.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,What's the notation for the eigenvectors?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:20.540,00:07:31.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,vk times lambda k times vk inverse.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:33.560,00:07:34.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:35.720,00:07:39.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, this is...
Dialogue: 0,00:07:39.340,00:07:43.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,The vk is going to contain all the eigenvectors of the matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:44.540,00:07:47.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Lambda k is going to contain all the eigenvalues of the matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:48.840,00:07:51.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,In this case, it's a 2 by 2 matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:52.080,00:07:58.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,Unless the two eigenvalues happens to be exactly the same, this lambda k is going to be a diagonal
Dialogue: 0,00:07:58.800,00:07:59.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:59.280,00:08:05.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,It has two diagonal entries corresponding to the two eigenvalues.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:05.720,00:08:08.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that's what we call the method of linear operation.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:08.280,00:08:10.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,We can call this the linear operation.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:10.060,00:08:11.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, we can call the method of linear operation.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:11.580,00:08:12.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:12.580,00:08:17.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,And these eigenvalues are exactly ck because taking eigenvalue of a matrix is a linear
Dialogue: 0,00:08:17.380,00:08:18.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,operator.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:18.380,00:08:21.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you multiply the matrix by 2, the eigenvalues are multiplied by 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:21.620,00:08:28.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, these eigenvalues are equal to ck times the eigenvalues of this u matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:28.620,00:08:35.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, in trying to ensure the scheme is stable, we have to put in the eigenvalues.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:35.180,00:08:41.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,is stable you only need to compute the eigenvalues of that matrix and the scale these eigenvalues by
Dialogue: 0,00:08:41.340,00:08:48.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,ck for different case so once you have that eigenvalue expansion what we can do is that
Dialogue: 0,00:08:51.740,00:09:02.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,we can multiply both sides by vk inverse so vk inverse d dt and by the way vk is not a function
Dialogue: 0,00:09:02.060,00:09:08.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,i mean the matrix ak is not a function of t therefore the eigenvectors are also not a
Dialogue: 0,00:09:08.540,00:09:14.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,function of t so once you multiply both sides by vk inverse we get that
Dialogue: 0,00:09:21.100,00:09:31.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,and in particular let's define the transformed vks as u tilde k and v tilde k let's define them
Dialogue: 0,00:09:31.660,00:09:31.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,as
Dialogue: 0,00:09:32.060,00:09:43.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,vk inverse times u hat k and v hat k right so the reason we're doing this is to diagonalize
Dialogue: 0,00:09:44.620,00:09:52.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,the differential equation is to decouple these coupled differential equations if we do this
Dialogue: 0,00:09:52.060,00:09:58.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,what we have is ddt because this vk is not a function of time it can be taken
Dialogue: 0,00:09:58.300,00:10:01.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,into the time derivative without modifying anything else
Dialogue: 0,00:10:03.020,00:10:07.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,so we can just write down the matrix as u tilde k and v tilde k
Dialogue: 0,00:10:07.980,00:10:14.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,so we have the first eigenvalue and the second eigenvalue let's just write down this matrix
Dialogue: 0,00:10:14.140,00:10:20.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,like this times u tilde k v tilde k
Dialogue: 0,00:10:24.060,00:10:28.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,we have zero and zero here that means these two variables
Dialogue: 0,00:10:28.620,00:10:31.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,u tilde and v tilde of k they evolve independently

Dialogue: 0,00:11:31.620,00:11:37.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,if we want to ensure a spatial discretization is stable for a system of

Dialogue: 0,00:13:14.720,00:13:19.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,then we have a linear growth on the solution error and if you have a system

Dialogue: 0,00:13:25.460,00:13:30.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,but if every eigenvalue is within the the stability region then it's a you
Dialogue: 0,00:13:30.900,00:13:35.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,still have the same property you still have found it still have bounded
Dialogue: 0,00:13:35.140,00:13:43.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,solution error you need to make sure all the most K have all the landas falling
Dialogue: 0,00:13:43.380,00:13:46.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,into the stability region
Dialogue: 0,00:13:46.540,00:13:49.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,how do you ensure that this is the case
Dialogue: 0,00:13:49.540,00:13:53.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,lambda ah lambdas are numbers
Dialogue: 0,00:13:53.260,00:13:55.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,lambda are numbers
Dialogue: 0,00:13:55.460,00:13:56.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,They are not functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:57.300,00:14:00.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,So each lambda k1 and each lambda k2 is a number.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:00.820,00:14:06.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,And k, remember, goes from minus n over 2 to n over 2 minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:07.740,00:14:08.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:14:08.500,00:14:11.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what I would do in this case is to take this matrix, analyze,
Dialogue: 0,00:14:12.420,00:14:15.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,take this u11, u12, u21, u22 matrix,
Dialogue: 0,00:14:15.240,00:14:18.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,look at the eigenvalues of that matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:19.220,00:14:22.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we know the eigenvalues of the matrix ak
Dialogue: 0,00:14:22.940,00:14:28.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,is equal to the eigenvalues of this matrix times the ck for different k's.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:30.200,00:14:30.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay?
Dialogue: 0,00:14:31.340,00:14:37.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,So basically there are two classes of numbers we want to look at.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:37.920,00:14:41.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,One is ck times the first eigenvalue of that matrix,
Dialogue: 0,00:14:41.500,00:14:44.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,and also the second number is the ck's, different ck's,
Dialogue: 0,00:14:44.960,00:14:47.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,multiplied by the second eigenvalue of the matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:48.960,00:14:50.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,If all of them, like I'm saying,
Dialogue: 0,00:14:50.620,00:14:52.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,so you can plot them in the stability,
Dialogue: 0,00:14:53.300,00:14:54.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,in the complex plane,
Dialogue: 0,00:14:54.480,00:14:57.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,if all of them lies within the stability region, you are good.
