Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The reason we use finite volume is really because of nonlinearity.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:09.000,00:00:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you think of all the examples we did in finite difference, most of them, at least on the differential operator, it is linear.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:20.000,00:00:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So when we go to nonlinear conservation laws, we are going to see that finite difference doesn't work anymore.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:28.000,00:00:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we'll see, first of all, why.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:31.000,00:00:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'll give you, first of all, a general form of nonlinear conservation laws, and then we give you specific examples.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:41.000,00:00:45.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in one dimension, a nonlinear conservation law looks like this.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:46.000,00:00:57.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,A time derivative of u plus the spatial derivative of not u itself, but a nonlinear function of u, equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:59.000,00:01:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,A more general form is that it is equal to an algebraic function of u, but let's think of this as 0 for now, at least in this lecture.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:10.000,00:01:13.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The nonlinearity lies within F.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:17.000,00:01:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And can somebody think of an example of a conservation law that we have touched about in previous lectures?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:26.000,00:01:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for heat equation, we have a second derivative of x, which means that F cannot be an algebraic function, but a differential operator.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:37.000,00:01:41.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's also fine, but this is not the simplest type of conservation laws we are going to be talking about here.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:42.000,00:01:53.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Conservation of mass, right, so this actually can be used to model conservation of mass, where F of u, if u is density, we'll talk about later that this is conservation of mass.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:53.000,00:02:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,But a very simple example we have touched about previously is F of u is equal to u.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:00.000,00:02:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,What kind of equation is that?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:03.000,00:02:05.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's just a linear vector equation, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:06.000,00:02:11.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And in this lecture, we'll just use a slightly different example.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:12.000,00:02:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's equal to u squared, for example.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:15.000,00:02:19.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Actually, to make our life a little bit easier in the derivation, we make half of u squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:20.000,00:02:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's called the Burgess equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:23.000,00:02:35.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the Burgess equation is really a prototypical nonlinear conservation law that is very, very simple.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:36.000,00:02:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It has the simplest form of nonlinearity, just a square.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:41.000,00:02:45.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you remove the square, it'll be just a linear vector equation, what we've discussed before.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:46.000,00:02:49.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Something that works perfectly, we find a difference.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:49.000,00:02:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And now with the square, we see things start to break down, we find a difference.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:55.000,00:03:03.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So before we discuss why things break down, we find a difference, let's first look at three different forms of the differential equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:04.000,00:03:15.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we'll see some form gives us better intuition, some form actually doesn't give us good intuition about the solution of the differential equation,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:15.000,00:03:19.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and sometimes lead to strange contradictions.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:20.000,00:03:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The first form is something we know how to deal with and find a difference.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:25.000,00:03:29.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you take chain rule on this term, what do you get?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:30.000,00:03:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,df du times du dx, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:33.000,00:03:39.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you apply chain rule to this, we get the so-called primitive form.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:40.000,00:03:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's partial u partial t plus df du.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:45.000,00:03:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Times partial u partial x is equal to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:49.000,00:03:51.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's the primitive form.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:52.000,00:03:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,In terms of the Berger's equation, what is it?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:55.000,00:03:57.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,What is df du?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:58.000,00:03:59.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's just u, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:00.000,00:04:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the Berger's equation is taking our linear vector equation before and replace our previously big u, which is a constant, with the small u, which is not a constant, it's actually the solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:16.000,00:04:19.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So one way to interpret the Berger's equation is,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:20.000,00:04:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's just a linear vector equation with a varying advection speed.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:27.000,00:04:31.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this advection speed is basically proportional to the solution value.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:32.000,00:04:37.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,If the solution locally is positive, the wave goes towards the right.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:38.000,00:04:41.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,If the solution locally is negative, the wave goes towards the left.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:42.000,00:04:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we will see in the MATLAB case, for example, if we type Berger's equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:53.000,00:05:01.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I would like somebody to come to our initial condition, trying to verify our initial interpretation of the Berger's equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:02.000,00:05:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Can somebody come and do an example of initial condition that tries to see if we can verify or disprove
Dialogue: 0,00:05:10.000,00:05:13.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,what we thought the Berger's equation would give you?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:14.000,00:05:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Go from inside, yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:21.000,00:05:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright, thank you.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:23.000,00:05:27.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now we are seeing how the Berger's equation is evolving.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:29.000,00:05:35.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the rate of evolution is pretty slow, so let's see if we can see the waves moving.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:36.000,00:05:37.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:37.000,00:05:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you can see like the positive side is actually slowly moving towards the right.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:43.000,00:05:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And on the left hand side I'm drawing a space-time plot, x-axis is x, y-axis is t.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:49.000,00:05:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I'm drawing the solution as a color contour.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:53.000,00:05:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you can see the positive side is actually moving towards the right.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:57.000,00:06:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So previously this discontinuity was to the left, and now it's moving towards the right of this x equal to 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:07.000,00:06:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this, for example, should move towards the left of x equal to 1.5.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:15.000,00:06:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's wait until this discontinuity crosses x equal to 1.5 to make sure it is actually moving towards the left.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:23.000,00:06:27.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right, now it's almost crossing.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:30.000,00:06:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what we were guessing was correct.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:32.000,00:06:45.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,But we have almost a linear advection equation whose wave is advecting according to the local solution value.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:46.000,00:06:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,But there are also something that is not the same as before.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:53.000,00:07:01.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,That is, if the advection speed is dependent on the solution value, then the wave no longer maintains its original shape anymore.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:02.000,00:07:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we see the wave actually distorting and becoming different from what you draw as the initial condition.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:11.000,00:07:19.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,In addition to that, we also see some of the original discontinuities expanding into a fan,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:20.000,00:07:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and some of the original discontinuities actually joining towards one stronger discontinuity.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:27.000,00:07:31.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this discontinuity is called shock waves.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:32.000,00:07:41.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is a nonlinear conservation law that doesn't actually appear in the linear differential equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:42.000,00:07:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright, so let's stop this simulation for now.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:47.000,00:07:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And go back here.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:51.000,00:07:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the primitive form that gives us a little bit of insight on how the waves are moving.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:57.000,00:08:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So think of this as a wave speed.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:00.000,00:08:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,For any differential equations, for any conservation equations with a different f,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:09.000,00:08:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we can always derive how does the wave speed depend on the local value of the solution u.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:15.000,00:08:21.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,For example, for this example, the very first example, the wave speed is always equal to 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:22.000,00:08:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And for the second example, the wave speed depends on the solution in a linear fashion.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:26.000,00:08:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now, the second form, the conservative form, is actually what I have written down here before.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:37.000,00:08:49.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the conservative form is partial u, partial t, plus partial fu, partial x equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:50.000,00:08:55.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And for the Burgess equation, it's partial u, partial t, plus partial partial x,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:56.000,00:08:58.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,of u squared over 2 equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:59.000,00:09:07.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now the reason we call it a conservative form is because it is used to derive the integral form,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:08.000,00:09:12.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,which really tells you why this is called a conservation law equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:13.000,00:09:15.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, integral form.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:18.000,00:09:23.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The integral form is taking the conservative form and integrating it over an interval.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:23.000,00:09:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, integrate from a to b, a is less than b, partial u, partial t, plus partial f, partial s.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:37.000,00:09:41.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,This over dx should equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:42.000,00:09:43.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:44.000,00:09:49.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, in the integral form, our a and b are fixed, independent of t, independent of u.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:50.000,00:09:51.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So they are just fixed numbers.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:51.000,00:09:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Two arbitrary fixed numbers with a.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:53.000,00:10:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, with the fixed 9 by 8 integration, that integral commutes with time derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:03.000,00:10:12.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,As long as a is not dependent on t, b is not dependent on t, then you can exchange the integral and the derivative,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:13.000,00:10:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and make the time derivative outside.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:15.000,00:10:19.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the time derivative of the integral becomes the first term.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:20.000,00:10:21.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:21.000,00:10:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the second term is the integral over a derivative in x.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:27.000,00:10:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Can we simplify that?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:31.000,00:10:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Fundamental law of calculus.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:33.000,00:10:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,That is, f evaluated on b minus f evaluated on a.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:42.000,00:10:43.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:47.000,00:10:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:48.000,00:10:51.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, think of what does this mean.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:52.000,00:10:58.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's write it in a maybe clearer way to illustrate how this means.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:58.000,00:11:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, I'll move this term to the right hand side.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:01.000,00:11:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'll write it f minus f .
Dialogue: 0,00:11:10.000,00:11:15.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The time derivative of the integral of the solution over a range
Dialogue: 0,00:11:15.000,00:11:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,is equal to the flux, f is called the flux, at the left of the range minus the flux at the right of the range.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:26.000,00:11:29.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So somebody mentioned conservation of mass.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:29.000,00:11:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:31.000,00:11:37.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,If, for example, the solution u is some kind of density,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:38.000,00:11:41.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,density of mass, density of electrical charge,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:41.000,00:11:43.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,density of energy, density of momentum,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:43.000,00:11:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,density of energy, density of momentum,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:44.000,00:11:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,density of momentum, or something.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:46.000,00:11:47.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:47.000,00:11:51.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,If u means density, then the integral means what?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:51.000,00:11:55.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The integral of the density over a spatial domain means what?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:56.000,00:12:01.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Means the total mass, or total energy, or total momentum, or total electrical charge, or something.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:01.000,00:12:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:12:02.000,00:12:05.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The total amount of stuff inside this range.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:07.000,00:12:09.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And d dt is the rate of change.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:10.000,00:12:13.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The rate of change of the total mass inside a volume.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:13.000,00:12:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's equal to the rate of flux going into the volume minus the rate of flux going out of the volume.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:23.000,00:12:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is why it means a conservation law.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:27.000,00:12:37.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because the integral form really tells you the conservation of some material over a volume.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:38.000,00:12:39.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright?
Dialogue: 0,00:12:39.000,00:12:43.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, for example, for the Berger's equation,
Dialogue: 0,00:12:43.000,00:12:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we get d dt integration over an arbitrary domain.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:48.000,00:12:51.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And for the integral form to be an integral form,
Dialogue: 0,00:12:51.000,00:12:57.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,it has to be over an arbitrary pair of time independent points.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:59.000,00:13:01.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Would be equal to
Dialogue: 0,00:13:01.000,00:13:07.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,u b squared over 2 minus u a squared over 2
Dialogue: 0,00:13:07.000,00:13:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,squared over 2 is equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:10.000,00:13:13.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that'll be the integral form of the Berger's equation.
