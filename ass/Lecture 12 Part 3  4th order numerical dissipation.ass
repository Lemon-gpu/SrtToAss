Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:06.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so if I do this, what do you think is the order of accuracy of my solution
Dialogue: 0,00:00:06.360,00:00:18.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,to my system of conservation laws? First order, why is that? Because I add a
Dialogue: 0,00:00:18.300,00:00:24.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,numerical dissipation that is on the order of Delta X, right? So basically I
Dialogue: 0,00:00:24.300,00:00:30.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,have modified my equation with a term that is proportional to Delta X. Of
Dialogue: 0,00:00:30.240,00:00:36.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,course the term is going to go to 0, as my Delta X goes to 0, but at a rate of
Dialogue: 0,00:00:36.960,00:00:43.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,only Delta X to the power of 1. And that's what makes the truncation error
Dialogue: 0,00:00:43.300,00:00:50.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,of my scheme to be first order. This guarantees stability, so I have a
Dialogue: 0,00:00:50.100,00:00:54.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,stability and that makes my solution error to be also
Dialogue: 0,00:00:54.220,00:00:54.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,1.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:54.300,00:00:58.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,going down at the same rate as my truncation error,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:58.500,00:01:00.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,which makes my solution first order.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:01.260,00:01:05.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have studied in a scalar conservation law case
Dialogue: 0,00:01:05.020,00:01:08.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,how to make the scheme more than first order.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:10.520,00:01:13.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,We have invented this limiter business
Dialogue: 0,00:01:13.900,00:01:18.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,that tells me that in smooth regions of the space,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:18.440,00:01:24.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,we are going to be using a high order scheme
Dialogue: 0,00:01:24.400,00:01:26.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,more than first order scheme.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:26.820,00:01:29.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,But where I'm close to any discontinuity,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:30.020,00:01:33.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm going to switch to a first order scheme like that.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:34.500,00:01:39.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So how do we make that switch in system of conservation laws?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:40.120,00:01:41.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,There are multiple methods,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:42.260,00:01:44.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I'm just going to introduce a method
Dialogue: 0,00:01:44.240,00:01:48.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,that is the easiest to implement.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:48.440,00:01:50.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that's the JST scheme.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:51.040,00:01:55.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the JST scheme basically switches
Dialogue: 0,00:01:55.980,00:01:58.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,between what we just discussed,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:59.520,00:02:01.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,a second order derivative,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:02.260,00:02:04.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,and a fourth order derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:06.900,00:02:10.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,Remember when we did the dissipation
Dialogue: 0,00:02:10.660,00:02:12.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,versus dispersion error analysis?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:13.380,00:02:15.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,There was a very good question of asking
Dialogue: 0,00:02:15.440,00:02:18.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,what is the behavior of a fourth order derivative?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:18.440,00:02:21.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we did a brief analysis.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:23.380,00:02:25.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,The effect of a fourth order derivative
Dialogue: 0,00:02:25.500,00:02:28.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,is very similar to a second order derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:28.460,00:02:29.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's dissipative.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:29.700,00:02:32.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,It removes energy from the solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:33.760,00:02:33.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:35.120,00:02:37.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,And it turns out
Dialogue: 0,00:02:37.500,00:02:40.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,a fourth order derivative
Dialogue: 0,00:02:40.280,00:02:44.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,is exactly what we are doing
Dialogue: 0,00:02:44.020,00:02:48.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,in our limiters when we set our phi r.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:48.440,00:02:50.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have phi r equal to one.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:50.440,00:02:52.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Why is that the case?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:52.440,00:02:56.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because if we set our limit to phi r equal to one,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:56.440,00:03:02.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,we are computing the left and right value
Dialogue: 0,00:03:02.440,00:03:06.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,on the interface by extrapolating the solution
Dialogue: 0,00:03:06.440,00:03:10.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,from the two adjacent cells to this left value.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:10.440,00:03:14.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I'm also extrapolating two adjacent cells

Dialogue: 0,00:03:16.440,00:03:17.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we can see that the left and right values are the same.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:17.580,00:03:18.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we can see that the left and right values are the same.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:18.280,00:03:20.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we can see that the left and right values are the same.
