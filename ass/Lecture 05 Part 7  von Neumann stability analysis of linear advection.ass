Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:15.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So linear action equation, we have partial u, partial t, plus a big U, partial small u, partial x equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:16.860,00:00:25.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,Fourier analysis of the continuous equation, I think we did it in the beginning, we no longer do it here.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:25.800,00:00:30.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we directly do our Fourier analysis to the discretized equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:31.800,00:00:38.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so, and as we did our first project, we know a more accurate way of discretizing the central,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:39.060,00:00:44.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,or the spatial derivative is through the central derivative, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:44.940,00:00:48.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's, what's the order of accuracy of that?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:50.020,00:00:54.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's going to be second order instead of the first order if you do it in one side, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:54.580,00:00:55.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:55.940,00:01:05.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,And now we expand the Ui, just the Ui in Fourier series and also discrete Fourier series.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:06.280,00:01:16.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Minus n over 2 and n over 2 plus 1, U hat k times e to the jk i delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:18.080,00:01:22.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, with this, the left-hand side becomes
Dialogue: 0,00:01:22.940,00:01:25.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,summation of k, and then we have the left-hand side becomes summation of k,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:25.800,00:01:32.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,dUi dt times e to the jk i delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:32.020,00:01:43.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this term becomes U still 2 delta x, still summation over k, still U hat of k,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:43.440,00:01:44.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,but this becomes different.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:45.940,00:01:53.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,jk i plus 1 delta x minus e to the jk i minus 1 delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:55.800,00:01:56.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:57.760,00:02:01.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now, this is equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:01.880,00:02:05.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, again, matching coefficients.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:05.980,00:02:13.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,This needs to be added to this times this needs to be 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:14.140,00:02:21.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, dUi dt plus big U times U hat of k.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:22.900,00:02:25.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, let's also expand this to be er.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:25.800,00:02:33.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, this is equal to E to the jk i delta x times e to the jk delta x minus e to the minus jk delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:34.020,00:02:34.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:34.280,00:02:40.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, this is basically extracting, expanding this i plus 1 and i minus 1
Dialogue: 0,00:02:40.340,00:02:47.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,into exponential of summations, which is equal to the product of exponentials.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:48.520,00:02:49.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:49.340,00:02:49.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:49.480,00:02:55.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, now we have e to the jk delta x minus e to the.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:55.800,00:03:00.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,minus jk delta x over 2 delta x equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:01.980,00:03:08.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Again, we can write this as an ODE equal to minus, in this case,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:09.500,00:03:20.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,U 2 delta x e to the jk delta x minus e to the minus jk delta x times Uk hat.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:21.240,00:03:25.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, this is no longer a real equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:25.800,00:03:26.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is a real number.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:26.800,00:03:28.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is a complex number.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:29.660,00:03:30.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:30.920,00:03:32.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is a complex number now.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:33.360,00:03:35.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this complex number, we can write it out.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:36.020,00:03:38.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,The cosine and cosine actually cancels.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:38.200,00:03:47.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,We get a 2j of sine of k delta x term divided by 2 delta x,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:47.320,00:03:52.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is equal to j times sine k delta x divided by delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:52.980,00:03:53.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:53.300,00:03:53.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:53.980,00:03:54.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.

Dialogue: 0,00:03:56.600,00:03:56.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:56.940,00:03:59.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Why do we have an i x j u?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:01.080,00:04:04.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,We already expanded u in Uk.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:04.840,00:04:05.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, it's Uk.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:05.760,00:04:05.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:06.040,00:04:06.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Sorry.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:06.720,00:04:08.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,We already expanded Uk.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:08.680,00:04:08.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:09.140,00:04:09.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.

Dialogue: 0,00:04:13.800,00:04:14.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:14.040,00:04:14.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,We already expanded.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:15.640,00:04:15.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:16.260,00:04:20.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, this is equal to that.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:20.760,00:04:24.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we need to multiply a minus u onto that.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:25.800,00:04:28.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,That is the lambda we'll be using.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:28.800,00:04:30.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:30.800,00:04:34.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, can somebody look at this lambda and tell me, can I use forward order on this?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:34.760,00:04:42.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,Can I use the same time integration scheme I used to solve this discretized differential equation?

Dialogue: 0,00:04:45.800,00:04:46.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,No?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:46.800,00:04:47.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:47.800,00:04:52.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well, it's dependent on u, so if you have a constant time set, there's a chance that
Dialogue: 0,00:04:52.800,00:04:54.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,u might fit through i.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:54.800,00:04:55.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,But, it's going to be u.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:55.640,00:04:56.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's going to be u.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:56.640,00:04:57.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,It depends on u.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:57.640,00:04:58.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Remember, I have a j here.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:58.640,00:04:59.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Last time, my lambda is purely real.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:59.640,00:05:00.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,This time, my lambda is purely imaginary.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:00.640,00:05:01.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:01.640,00:05:02.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, this is my lambda.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:02.640,00:05:03.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,For different case, my lambdas are here and here.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:03.640,00:05:04.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is where my lambdas are.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:04.640,00:05:19.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the maximum I can get, because sine can get to 1 and minus 1, the maximum I can get
Dialogue: 0,00:05:19.640,00:05:20.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,is u over delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:20.640,00:05:21.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:21.640,00:05:22.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, that's my lambda.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:22.640,00:05:23.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,And, that's the last one.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:23.640,00:05:24.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:24.640,00:05:29.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, I have u over delta x and minus u over delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:29.640,00:05:32.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, these are my lambdas.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:32.640,00:05:40.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,And, do you remember where delta t times lambda has to be for forward order to be stable?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:40.640,00:05:42.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, this is real of lambda.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:42.640,00:05:46.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is imaginary of lambda.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:46.640,00:05:52.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,If we multiply by delta t, this will be delta t and delta t.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:52.640,00:05:56.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,And, forward order is stable only on this.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:56.640,00:05:57.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:57.640,00:05:59.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Minus 1, minus 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:59.640,00:06:04.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Forward order is only stable over this domain.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:04.640,00:06:12.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, we have an unstable situation if we use forward order for this equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:12.640,00:06:13.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:13.640,00:06:21.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,You actually expect to get unstable solutions if you use forward order with a central difference
Dialogue: 0,00:06:21.640,00:06:28.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,discretization of advection scheme, of advection equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:28.640,00:06:32.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is there any part of the analysis that is surprising to you or not clear?
