Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:05.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So when you are talking about verification and validation, there are two topics, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:05.000,00:00:11.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,There is the validation, which is, are we solving, is the equation actually representing the physics?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:11.000,00:00:15.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,This isn't something a software can decide or a numerical system can decide.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:15.000,00:00:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's something you decide based on your experiments or something physical.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:20.000,00:00:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Whereas the verification is, am I solving that equation accurately?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:25.000,00:00:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So basically you go from a physical model to a mathematical model to a numerical solution or to an analytical solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:32.000,00:00:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the verification part is, did I make the right transition from the physical model to a PDE or a mathematical model?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:40.000,00:00:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,But what we focus now is the verification, the last step.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:44.000,00:00:49.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that we compare with exact solution, with benchmark solutions.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:49.000,00:00:55.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,But what we can do is when you don't have exact solution, when you don't have experimental data,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:55.000,00:00:58.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,there is this thing called the method of manufactured solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:58.000,00:01:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's pretty cool. Actually, I was very psyched when I first found out about it when I was doing the grad school project.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:04.000,00:01:07.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Google is method of manufactured solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:07.000,00:01:13.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,There is a big document from the Sandia National Lab that explains every detail.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:13.000,00:01:15.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,They use it for their nuclear testing.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:15.000,00:01:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the idea is maybe this equation is nonlinear or coupled, so you don't really know how to derive an exact solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:22.000,00:01:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,You assume a solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:24.000,00:01:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,You start with a solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:25.000,00:01:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,You start with an assumed solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:26.000,00:01:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,You're going to say, hey, let's assume U is equal to this in terms of F and in terms of whatever space and time.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:32.000,00:01:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,You make that assumption.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:34.000,00:01:35.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, plug it into the ODE.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:35.000,00:01:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,What do you get?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:36.000,00:01:37.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Into the PDE.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:37.000,00:01:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you plug it into the PDE, you get a source term.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:40.000,00:01:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then if you evaluate that solution at the boundaries, you get boundary condition.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:46.000,00:01:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if you evaluate that at T is equal to zero, you get initial conditions.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:50.000,00:01:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, what you are going to ask is, if I now take this source term, initial condition,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:54.000,00:02:01.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and boundary condition that I derived out of the assumed solution and put it into my numerical solver,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:01.000,00:02:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,will it give me back the assumed solution?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:04.000,00:02:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Do you get the idea?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:06.000,00:02:13.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And here, the only thing is that you should assume uniqueness of your solution, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:13.000,00:02:19.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,If within a certain boundary condition and initial condition you can have multiple solutions, this may not work.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:19.000,00:02:23.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,But otherwise, it's a very convenient way of testing.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:23.000,00:02:37.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, the homework problem is in the booklet, Comsolve Mathematics, you got that on Monday, maybe?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:37.000,00:02:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let me give you a booklet with exercises.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:40.000,00:02:49.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,There, there is this exercise, the BASMA exercise, where in that case, you are going to solve it using the Newton physics interface.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:49.000,00:02:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,There in the booklet, it gives detailed instruction about the BASMA exercise.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:52.000,00:02:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,There is also a section about using the electric current and the heat transfer.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:56.000,00:03:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then for the coupling, to use the electromagnetic heat source to model this.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:02.000,00:03:07.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Your homework is to do that problem using equation-based modeling.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:07.000,00:03:12.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Using PDs directly, not using heat transfer or multi-physics.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:12.000,00:03:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So first, you know you can click on this physics and see what the equation is.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:16.000,00:03:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So find the equations from there and the boundary conditions from that booklet.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:20.000,00:03:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then, solve it using PD interface.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:25.000,00:03:29.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So basically, two PDs and then you need to couple them.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:29.000,00:03:35.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you need to know what the equation for the joule heating is and add it.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:35.000,00:03:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is the exercise clear?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:38.000,00:03:39.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:39.000,00:03:43.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Could you send us a soft copy of the booklet? I don't think everyone has got it.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:43.000,00:03:49.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, if you haven't, I will ask Mian to send you a soft copy for everyone.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:50.000,00:03:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Who wants a hard copy?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:57.000,00:03:59.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The last guy there, great to be signed.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:59.000,00:04:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any questions? Anything all clear?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:02.000,00:04:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright, thank you for coming.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:07.000,00:04:09.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Do you all write your names in here?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:09.000,00:04:11.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Do you sign in?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:11.000,00:04:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Anybody who didn't sign in?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:14.000,00:04:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Check your names here.
