Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:04.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,The example I'm going to give is the one-dimensional Poisson's equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:05.280,00:00:15.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,The Poisson's equation is the second-order derivative of u plus a known function f is equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:16.620,00:00:24.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,And let me solve this within the spatial domain of 0 and 1 with the simplest type of boundary conditions.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:24.640,00:00:32.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,In this case, we no longer know what the solution u is.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:32.300,00:00:36.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,We only know that the solution u satisfies a certain differential equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:37.280,00:00:42.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,So how do we use the same procedure we discussed before to solve this equation?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:47.440,00:00:51.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,It turns out there are two ways to look at this.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:52.700,00:00:53.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,The first way.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:54.640,00:01:01.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is to try to integrate this equation with a function.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:03.500,00:01:05.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right, so approach one.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:10.540,00:01:12.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let...
Dialogue: 0,00:01:15.300,00:01:23.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to let a function g also...
Dialogue: 0,00:01:24.380,00:01:24.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,To...
Dialogue: 0,00:01:24.640,00:01:26.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,To be 0 and 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:26.840,00:01:27.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,To be...
Dialogue: 0,00:01:27.920,00:01:29.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's say to be smooth.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:31.340,00:01:31.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:32.420,00:01:38.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,And what I'm going to do is that because this equation is equal to 0 within the whole domain.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:39.520,00:01:46.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,I can integrate g of x times the residual of the differential equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:46.700,00:01:48.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,Which has to be equal to 0 everywhere.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:48.420,00:01:52.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this should be equal to 0 within the whole domain.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:52.900,00:01:54.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,And because this function is...
Dialogue: 0,00:01:54.640,00:01:56.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is equal to 0 within the whole domain of .
Dialogue: 0,00:01:56.940,00:02:02.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,The integration of this function over space should be equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:02.340,00:02:05.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,For any smooth function g.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:05.140,00:02:07.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:07.140,00:02:11.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So basically what I'm going to do is this has to be true for any g.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:14.640,00:02:15.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:17.440,00:02:17.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:17.940,00:02:23.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to restrict f and g.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:23.840,00:02:24.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,Within the space.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:24.340,00:02:25.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Within the same linear space.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:27.540,00:02:29.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to restrict.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:32.040,00:02:38.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,f is going to be forced to be a linear combination of a certain basis functions.

Dialogue: 0,00:02:40.740,00:02:42.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,And g of x.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:42.740,00:02:46.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm going to force it to be the actual basis functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:46.140,00:02:47.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,J goes from 1 to n.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:48.640,00:02:54.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,The reason I can force g to be any of the basis functions is because if this equality is true.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:54.140,00:02:56.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,For any of the phi j's.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:57.940,00:03:02.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then it has to be also true for any linear combination of the phi j's.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:02.440,00:03:06.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Which covers an entire n dimensional linear space.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:08.940,00:03:09.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:10.540,00:03:10.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:11.240,00:03:13.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if I perform that restriction.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:13.740,00:03:17.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,What I'm going to derive out of the equality is.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:18.940,00:03:21.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,I replace g with phi j.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:24.140,00:03:24.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:26.340,00:03:27.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm going to.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:30.840,00:03:32.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm also going to replace.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:33.640,00:03:34.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:34.740,00:03:35.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm sorry.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:35.540,00:03:36.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,I messed up.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:36.540,00:03:38.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,I shouldn't be replacing f.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:38.040,00:03:38.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,I should be.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:39.040,00:03:39.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,I should.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:39.540,00:03:40.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,I shouldn't be restricting f.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:40.940,00:03:43.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,I should be restricting the solution u.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:43.640,00:03:46.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Previously we restricted f because we wanted to approximate f.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:47.240,00:03:49.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,In this case we wanted to approximate u.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:49.440,00:03:52.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we want to represent the solution u.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:52.540,00:03:53.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,As a linear combination of.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:53.840,00:03:55.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,Of these basis functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:55.340,00:03:57.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we represent u as this linear combination.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:58.240,00:04:01.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So here the u i's are not functions of space.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:01.840,00:04:04.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,And phi i's are functions of space.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:04.940,00:04:08.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we integrate u i.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:08.540,00:04:12.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the second order derivative is going to be applied.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:13.840,00:04:16.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,To the basis functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:20.440,00:04:21.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:23.840,00:04:24.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,So.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:24.340,00:04:30.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Again we are going to pull these summations.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:30.840,00:04:32.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Out of the integral.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:32.840,00:04:35.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,What we get is summation of i goes from 1 to n.
