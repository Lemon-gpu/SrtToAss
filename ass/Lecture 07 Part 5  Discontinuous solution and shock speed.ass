Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:09.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if all my solutions are continuous, are smooth, these features should allow me to
Dialogue: 0,00:00:09.000,00:00:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,exactly analytically solve this conservation law, right? So actually if
Dialogue: 0,00:00:18.000,00:00:24.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,my solution is continuous I don't really need any numerical methods. So for
Dialogue: 0,00:00:24.200,00:00:30.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,example I have an initial condition t equal to zero. So let's see I have
Dialogue: 0,00:00:30.860,00:00:37.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,all the solutions available over here. Then I can basically start from every
Dialogue: 0,00:00:37.460,00:00:41.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,point in the solution a characteristic because I know which direction it goes.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:41.280,00:00:45.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,For example if I know it's positive I shoot it forward, if I know this is this I
Dialogue: 0,00:00:45.860,00:00:50.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,shoot it this way, if I know this is negative I shoot it that way, right? So at
Dialogue: 0,00:00:50.300,00:00:53.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,every point I can shoot a ray into
Dialogue: 0,00:00:53.720,00:00:54.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,this.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:54.200,00:01:01.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,The future. And I know the solution along that ray is going to be constant. So I
Dialogue: 0,00:01:01.280,00:01:04.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,know all my future solutions, don't I?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:04.700,00:01:13.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,No. Because these intersect, right? Because these actually run into each other and
Dialogue: 0,00:01:13.880,00:01:19.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,when they run into each other, should I pick the value on the left or should I pick the
Dialogue: 0,00:01:19.380,00:01:20.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,value on the right?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:20.540,00:01:23.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay so
Dialogue: 0,00:01:24.200,00:01:30.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,in here actually I think we actually see a case where there are two lines, I mean
Dialogue: 0,00:01:30.120,00:01:33.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,these are discontinuities. I mean we can see things
Dialogue: 0,00:01:33.620,00:01:39.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,run into each other. So what happens when characteristics run into each
Dialogue: 0,00:01:39.780,00:01:40.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,other?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:40.400,00:01:45.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,What should I pick? Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:45.400,00:01:53.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh if I have just two values running into, I can do that but like in general I have things
Dialogue: 0,00:01:53.720,00:01:58.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,continuously run into each other, right? So I have infinitely many characteristic
Dialogue: 0,00:01:58.840,00:02:04.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,lines and they are continuous, they are everywhere. Here of course I'm only
Dialogue: 0,00:02:04.120,00:02:07.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,drawing contours at a discrete level because I mean otherwise the whole thing
Dialogue: 0,00:02:07.960,00:02:14.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,is going to be black. But in reality things are everywhere. Every single point
Dialogue: 0,00:02:14.480,00:02:18.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,has a characteristic line. So I get things everywhere running into each other
Dialogue: 0,00:02:18.800,00:02:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,continuously. So in order for us to analyze that, we need something other
Dialogue: 0,00:02:26.000,00:02:33.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,than the primitive form. This is because once we have things running into each
Dialogue: 0,00:02:33.440,00:02:37.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,other we know, okay, immediately towards the left of the solution I still know its
Dialogue: 0,00:02:37.860,00:02:42.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,value, immediately towards the right of the solution I know its value, but the
Dialogue: 0,00:02:42.260,00:02:47.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,solution may be discontinuous over that point.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:47.300,00:02:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And
Dialogue: 0,00:02:48.000,00:02:48.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,we
Dialogue: 0,00:02:48.500,00:02:48.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,have a
Dialogue: 0,00:02:48.780,00:02:58.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,when things are discontinuous, what do I mean by partial f of u, partial x, over a
Dialogue: 0,00:02:58.780,00:03:10.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,discontinuity? Okay, what does that mean? If u is not continuous f of u, do I expect
Dialogue: 0,00:03:10.440,00:03:18.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,to be continuous? No. I mean if I don't even have continuity, not to say differential
Dialogue: 0,00:03:18.480,00:03:24.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,density, how can I take spatial derivatives? Doesn't make any sense.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:24.480,00:03:31.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right? So the problem about nonlinear conservation laws, the reason we cannot
Dialogue: 0,00:03:31.140,00:03:36.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,use finite difference is because the characteristic lines, they run into each
Dialogue: 0,00:03:36.060,00:03:40.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,other. They are not straight. And because they are not straight, they run into each
Dialogue: 0,00:03:40.080,00:03:44.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,other. And the moment they run into each other, it doesn't make any sense anymore
Dialogue: 0,00:03:44.820,00:03:47.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,to take a spatial derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:48.480,00:04:00.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what can we do? Use the integral form. Yes. Otherwise, why are we here studying
Dialogue: 0,00:04:00.100,00:04:15.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,numerical PDEs? So use integral form. Use integral form. And that's why we got rid of
Dialogue: 0,00:04:15.540,00:04:17.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,the spatial derivative by integrating.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:17.480,00:04:17.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:17.980,00:04:38.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,Integrating over x. So we have d dt integration over a, b, u, dx plus f of u at b minus f of u at a
Dialogue: 0,00:04:38.160,00:04:46.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,equal to zero. And let's analyze the behavior around the continuity by choosing a and b very
Dialogue: 0,00:04:46.960,00:04:47.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,close to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:47.980,00:04:53.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's very simple.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:53.260,00:04:53.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,And what makes that möglich?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:53.560,00:04:54.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Samples?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:54.120,00:04:55.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,No, no.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:55.300,00:04:56.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what happens?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:56.300,00:05:02.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,The key here is this.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:02.640,00:05:06.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So problem boundary can appear in every one of the && double clausIm Arena distribution
Dialogue: 0,00:05:06.860,00:05:11.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,case when the left and the right of interval is to the right of the
Dialogue: 0,00:05:11.340,00:05:12.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,discontinuity.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:12.220,00:05:15.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,The right of interval is the solution as such to theclean the binomial of 2siec.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:15.680,00:05:16.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,The 돼요 splitting the sceint р venir pastry — toh the跡 Jenn insurance.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:16.520,00:05:17.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,associated across individual aspects.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:17.860,00:05:24.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,is that the value of the function u at a is basically the left-hand side of the
Dialogue: 0,00:05:24.580,00:05:28.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,discontinuity. So among that discontinuity you can see like you have a
Dialogue: 0,00:05:28.100,00:05:33.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,range of values. The lowest value which is the right-hand side
Dialogue: 0,00:05:33.700,00:05:40.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,value is minus 0.6 something and the left value is 0.7 something right so
Dialogue: 0,00:05:40.580,00:05:50.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,so we have a u left and a u right. So by choosing that interval let's say the
Dialogue: 0,00:05:50.720,00:06:04.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,discontinuity is at c and that discontinuity actually moves as
Dialogue: 0,00:06:04.420,00:06:09.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,time increases. So for example if you look at this thick line
Dialogue: 0,00:06:09.860,00:06:10.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,right here. So if you look at this thick line
Dialogue: 0,00:06:10.560,00:06:10.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,right here. So if you look at this thick line
Dialogue: 0,00:06:10.580,00:06:18.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,this thick line is a function of of t right. So it moves just like
Dialogue: 0,00:06:18.260,00:06:22.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,characteristics but they don't follow straight lines. They can turn
Dialogue: 0,00:06:22.100,00:06:25.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,right. So let's figure out how do they move.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:25.620,00:06:32.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,So discontinuity at c of which may depend on time and let's see
Dialogue: 0,00:06:32.100,00:06:38.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,how it moves. So let's say a is equal to c minus epsilon and b
Dialogue: 0,00:06:38.500,00:06:40.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,is equal to c plus epsilon.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:40.560,00:06:45.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,that means you
Dialogue: 0,00:06:45.100,00:06:49.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,at a is equal to you let's say I
Dialogue: 0,00:06:49.060,00:06:52.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,you left so the to do not the left value you of
Dialogue: 0,00:06:52.880,00:06:56.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,the is equal to you right so
Dialogue: 0,00:06:56.440,00:06:59.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,integration of a B you
Dialogue: 0,00:06:59.520,00:07:02.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,the axe is equal to what
Dialogue: 0,00:07:02.940,00:07:07.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,right we have a domain a
Dialogue: 0,00:07:07.000,00:07:10.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,be very very small on the left hand side
Dialogue: 0,00:07:10.340,00:07:14.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's you could be you L on the right hand side is equal to
Dialogue: 0,00:07:14.320,00:07:19.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,you are the interval is so small that we can consider the function to be
Dialogue: 0,00:07:19.620,00:07:23.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,constant on the left and right of these
Dialogue: 0,00:07:23.580,00:07:27.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,shock so what is this into growth you
Dialogue: 0,00:07:27.780,00:07:31.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,over the axe yes if you L plus you are
Dialogue: 0,00:07:31.940,00:07:35.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,are divide by two times absolute
Dialogue: 0,00:07:35.220,00:07:38.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,right 0 to absolute yes so it's a
Dialogue: 0,00:07:38.700,00:07:40.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,if you L
Dialogue: 0,00:07:40.340,00:07:44.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,plus you are times absolute yeah that's right okay
Dialogue: 0,00:07:44.840,00:07:48.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,so I am I'm interested in
Dialogue: 0,00:07:48.860,00:07:52.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,analyzing how that value changes
Dialogue: 0,00:07:52.100,00:07:57.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,as time evolves because as time increases let's say time increases from
Dialogue: 0,00:07:57.660,00:07:58.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,that next level
Dialogue: 0,00:07:58.980,00:08:02.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,the shock me go over here
Dialogue: 0,00:08:02.700,00:08:05.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,right
Dialogue: 0,00:08:05.960,00:08:10.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,so so what is that what is that
Dialogue: 0,00:08:10.340,00:08:14.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,wave speed
Dialogue: 0,00:08:14.340,00:08:18.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,what is that wave speed so what is
Dialogue: 0,00:08:18.260,00:08:21.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,discontinued at the let's modify it see
Dialogue: 0,00:08:21.620,00:08:25.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,plus a shock speed
Dialogue: 0,00:08:25.300,00:08:28.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,so SS called shock speed
Dialogue: 0,00:08:28.420,00:08:32.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,times times T so so let's say this is the
Dialogue: 0,00:08:32.280,00:08:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,this is the are okay so let's let's let's
Dialogue: 0,00:08:36.000,00:08:40.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,make it a little bit more rigorous see is a function of T
Dialogue: 0,00:08:40.260,00:08:43.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we want to compute the shock speed
Dialogue: 0,00:08:43.760,00:08:48.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is defined as DC over DT
Dialogue: 0,00:08:48.080,00:08:51.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,okay and so
Dialogue: 0,00:08:51.480,00:08:57.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,this a is at see at time equal to zero minus epsilon be is equal to see at
Dialogue: 0,00:08:57.300,00:08:58.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,time equal to zero
Dialogue: 0,00:08:58.780,00:09:03.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,plus accident so at time increases
Dialogue: 0,00:09:03.260,00:09:07.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,by it infinite has a mode out at T
Dialogue: 0,00:09:07.100,00:09:12.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,this is at C 0 and this is now at C 0
Dialogue: 0,00:09:12.380,00:09:15.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,plus shock speed times this
Dialogue: 0,00:09:15.800,00:09:20.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,infinite has a mo DT so you L plus you are times epsilon
Dialogue: 0,00:09:20.160,00:09:24.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,are at T equal to zero
Dialogue: 0,00:09:24.460,00:09:27.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,and at T equal to
Dialogue: 0,00:09:27.780,00:09:33.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,a very small duty integration of
Dialogue: 0,00:09:33.180,00:09:36.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,you between a and B has changed by how much
Dialogue: 0,00:09:37.100,00:09:40.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,up so this is C 0 right
Dialogue: 0,00:09:40.380,00:09:44.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,up in the initial initial time this is
Dialogue: 0,00:09:44.340,00:09:47.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,when the shock has moved by a little bit
Dialogue: 0,00:09:47.540,00:09:52.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the speed of the movement is SS so over DT
Dialogue: 0,00:09:52.060,00:09:55.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,it should moved towards the right by SS times DT
Dialogue: 0,00:09:55.800,00:10:00.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,and at T equal to DT the total integral
Dialogue: 0,00:10:00.080,00:10:03.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,has changed from
Dialogue: 0,00:10:03.300,00:10:06.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,this value which is
Dialogue: 0,00:10:06.340,00:10:12.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,underneath these rat curve to this value
Dialogue: 0,00:10:12.300,00:10:16.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,underneath the blue curve so what is the delta what is the change in the
Dialogue: 0,00:10:16.420,00:10:17.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,integral
Dialogue: 0,00:10:17.020,00:10:20.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,the change in the integral is
Dialogue: 0,00:10:20.180,00:10:23.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,equal to minus
Dialogue: 0,00:10:23.200,00:10:28.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,of this area right the change in the integral
Dialogue: 0,00:10:28.340,00:10:31.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,is equal to minus of you are
Dialogue: 0,00:10:31.540,00:10:35.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,minus you L times as
Dialogue: 0,00:10:35.820,00:10:42.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,DT of course plus the original

Dialogue: 0,00:10:46.520,00:10:50.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,can we compute the time derivative DDT of these

Dialogue: 0,00:10:54.800,00:11:00.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,is equal to what the difference between these and these

Dialogue: 0,00:11:33.420,00:11:33.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,0érer
Dialogue: 0,00:11:33.580,00:11:36.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,in the integral form of the equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:38.240,00:11:41.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because the first time in the integral of the equation,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:41.780,00:11:47.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,the time derivative of the total mass within this small interval
Dialogue: 0,00:11:47.480,00:11:53.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,is equal to the flux at the left minus the flux at the right,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:54.320,00:11:56.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,also over this very small interval.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:57.280,00:12:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then I can compute from the difference in the flux
Dialogue: 0,00:12:00.000,00:12:03.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,the speed of the shock wave.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:05.180,00:12:06.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's do that.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:07.220,00:12:13.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's write down the integral form of the equation
Dialogue: 0,00:12:13.780,00:12:18.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,where a and b are very small intervals around the discontinuity.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:18.500,00:12:29.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,b is equal to f of u at x equal to a minus f of u at x equal to b
Dialogue: 0,00:12:29.980,00:12:37.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,and this term we know is ul minus ur
Dialogue: 0,00:12:37.080,00:12:47.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,so ul minus ur times the speed of the shock wave.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:51.060,00:12:52.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,How about the right-hand side?
Dialogue: 0,00:12:56.120,00:12:59.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,x equal to a, the value of u is exactly ul.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:59.980,00:13:05.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we can calculate that's right at the left of the discontinuity.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:05.880,00:13:10.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is equal to f of ul minus,
Dialogue: 0,00:13:10.580,00:13:14.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,this is x equal to b to the right of the discontinuity,
Dialogue: 0,00:13:15.020,00:13:16.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,that's f of ur.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:18.660,00:13:19.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is easy.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:20.340,00:13:23.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,That allows us to compute the speed of the shock wave
Dialogue: 0,00:13:24.060,00:13:27.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,being f of ul minus f of ur
Dialogue: 0,00:13:27.860,00:13:29.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,divided by ul.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:29.980,00:13:35.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we can get the difference between l minus ur.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:35.100,00:13:36.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, it's a very good question.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:36.420,00:13:37.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is that df by du?
Dialogue: 0,00:13:37.800,00:13:38.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:38.800,00:13:42.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this looks very similar to df du
Dialogue: 0,00:13:42.720,00:13:48.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,because that looks like a finite difference approximation to df du, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:13:48.360,00:13:52.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,But this is special because this is more
Dialogue: 0,00:13:52.580,00:13:58.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,because df du only works when we have a continuous solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:58.660,00:13:59.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,So at the limit of a very small interval, we have a continuous solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:59.700,00:14:02.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have a very, very small discontinuity.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:02.260,00:14:05.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,This, the speed of this,
Dialogue: 0,00:14:05.460,00:14:09.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,the speed of this very small discontinuity
Dialogue: 0,00:14:09.180,00:14:13.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,is actually and should be equal to the characteristic speed
Dialogue: 0,00:14:13.700,00:14:15.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,or the speed of the wave.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:15.940,00:14:20.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,But this formula gives you more.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:20.020,00:14:23.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,It gives you the speed of a large discontinuity also.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:23.900,00:14:28.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,It gives you how would a non-infinite,
Dialogue: 0,00:14:29.700,00:14:32.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,infinitesimal discontinuity would propagate.
