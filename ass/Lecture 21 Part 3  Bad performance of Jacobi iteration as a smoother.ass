Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:04.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,We have used Gauss-Seidel as smoother.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:04.980,00:00:13.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we have the purpose of the smoother is one is to improve the solution, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:15.440,00:00:26.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,And another important role of the smoother is to remove the high frequency content of the solution error.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:26.440,00:00:33.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that the residual can be interpolated to the causal grid.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:35.000,00:00:43.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the single most important role of these few iterations I performed in the beginning of the multigrid cycle.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:45.620,00:00:53.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for example, if instead of Gauss-Seidel iterations I'm performing here,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:53.560,00:00:56.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,if I change them to Jacobi iterations,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:56.440,00:01:01.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,what do you think is going to be the effect to the multigrid algorithm?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:03.580,00:01:05.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's try that.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:05.840,00:01:07.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,Jacobi.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:07.460,00:01:11.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let me remove all these breakpoints and
Dialogue: 0,00:01:12.440,00:01:15.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'll also make
Dialogue: 0,00:01:16.680,00:01:18.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,this to be Jacobi.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:20.020,00:01:26.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, I'm not going to change the causal grid iteration because it's going to be, no matter using Gauss-Seidel,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:26.320,00:01:29.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,it is going to basically give us the exact solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:29.200,00:01:31.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:31.200,00:01:39.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now I just changed the pre- and post-smoothing operations from Gauss-Seidel to Jacobi.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:39.200,00:01:41.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,And let's see what is the effect.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:41.200,00:01:48.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's also make a bunch of zeros and perform one multigrid cycle.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:48.200,00:01:54.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,U is equal to multigrid of U and B.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:54.200,00:01:56.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's IMP.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:56.320,00:01:57.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,And show a few.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:57.320,00:01:59.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,What do you think we're going to get?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:01.320,00:02:06.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,We get something that is a little bit less accurate than what we had before.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:06.320,00:02:07.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:07.320,00:02:11.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Maybe we just perform one iteration.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:11.320,00:02:13.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's do this again.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:15.320,00:02:16.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Doesn't really help.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:16.320,00:02:17.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:17.320,00:02:19.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what's happening?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:19.320,00:02:24.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Why is Gauss-Seidel working but Jacobi is not working?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:26.320,00:02:37.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,For this, we again have to dive into the eigenvalue and eigenvector analysis of Gauss-Seidel and Jacobi.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:37.320,00:02:43.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So do we remember when we performed many, many Jacobi iterations,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:43.320,00:02:47.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,what is the mode that converged the slowest?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:52.320,00:02:55.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,What is the solution error after many iterations?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:55.320,00:03:01.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,It was the low frequency mode, exactly.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:01.320,00:03:07.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,But for Jacobi iteration, it is not only the low frequency mode that converges the slowest.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:07.320,00:03:12.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,There are some other modes that also converge very slowly.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:12.320,00:03:14.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,What do you think is that mode?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:14.320,00:03:16.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's think in 1D.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:16.320,00:03:18.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,1D.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:18.320,00:03:21.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So X.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:21.320,00:03:24.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,We have grid point over here.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:24.320,00:03:29.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:29.320,00:03:33.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's just write down the discretization.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:33.320,00:03:44.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So U of I minus 1 minus 2 U I plus U I plus 1 divided by delta X square equal to F of I.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:44.320,00:03:51.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,And to make the Jacobi iteration, we are assigning this to K.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:51.320,00:03:52.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is the lower diagonal part.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:52.320,00:03:54.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is the K plus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:54.320,00:03:55.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,The diagonal part.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:55.320,00:04:01.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the K, the upper diagonal part.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:01.320,00:04:08.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the Jacobi iteration is moving the K plus 1 part, keeping that on the left-hand side,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:08.320,00:04:13.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,and moving the known to the right-hand side.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:13.320,00:04:21.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have minus delta X square over 2 F I plus half of U I K.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:21.320,00:04:23.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the U I K.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:24.320,00:04:28.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,U I minus 1 K, U I plus 1 K.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:28.320,00:04:39.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,It is very intuitive that if I have a mode that is very, very smooth,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:39.320,00:04:50.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,this particular iteration being the average of the two neighboring grid points would converge very slowly.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:50.320,00:04:51.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:51.320,00:04:53.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So particularly if I write the error equation,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:53.320,00:05:02.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,if I define E I K plus 1 to be defined as U I K plus 1 minus U I,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:02.320,00:05:04.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is the exact solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:04.320,00:05:08.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,My E I of K plus 1 would be equal to,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:08.320,00:05:16.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,this term gets cancelled if I subtract the iteration with what is satisfied by the exact solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:16.320,00:05:21.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,What I get is E I K plus 1 is equal to the average of E I K plus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:21.320,00:05:28.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I have the average of E I plus 1 K and E I minus 1 K.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:28.320,00:05:33.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,That means if I have a very, very smooth solution,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:33.320,00:05:35.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,so let's say this is my,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:35.320,00:05:38.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,I have a very smooth solution error.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:38.320,00:05:39.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Excuse me.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:39.320,00:05:44.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if this is E I K,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:44.320,00:05:48.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,in my next iteration, what is going to be my solution error?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:48.320,00:05:50.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,What is going to be, let's say, blue is E I K.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:51.320,00:05:54.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,K plus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:54.320,00:06:02.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,My solution error is going to decay very slowly because my E I K plus 1 on this grid point would be the average of these two.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:02.320,00:06:08.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I would be drawing a straight line and my E I K plus 1 would be here.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:08.320,00:06:12.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So see how slow it decays.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:12.320,00:06:14.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,To figure out what is the blue line at this point,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:14.320,00:06:17.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,I would be drawing a straight line between the neighboring grid points.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:17.320,00:06:20.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,E I K plus 1 would be here.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:20.320,00:06:24.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,I would be drawing a straight line and the E I K plus 1 would be here.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:24.320,00:06:29.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,As long as this line still has some curvature,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:29.320,00:06:36.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,my E I K is going to decay as K increases as I'm taking these averages.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:36.320,00:06:41.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,But you can see the smaller the curvature of the E I K is,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:41.320,00:06:43.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,the smoother it is,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:43.320,00:06:47.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,in other words, the slower it will decay.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:50.320,00:06:55.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,But this is one opposite of the spectrum for Jacobi iteration.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:55.320,00:07:03.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,There is another type of solution error that also would decay very slowly.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:03.320,00:07:08.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that type of error is the extreme opposite of a smooth solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:08.320,00:07:16.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,It is the most non-smooth solution you can imagine that also decays very slowly.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:16.320,00:07:18.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Why is that?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:20.320,00:07:22.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's try it.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:22.320,00:07:26.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's try to imagine I have a solution x.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:26.320,00:07:28.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is solution error.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:28.320,00:07:34.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,If I have a solution error that is as non-smooth as you can imagine,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:34.320,00:07:38.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,that is one positive, one negative, one positive, one negative,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:38.320,00:07:43.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,another positive, another negative, another positive, another negative, like that.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:43.320,00:07:47.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,A grid by grid oscillation.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:47.320,00:07:48.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's see.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:48.320,00:07:50.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,If this is E I K,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:50.320,00:07:57.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I use another color to denote E I K plus 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:57.320,00:08:02.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,what is going to be E I K plus 1 for the second grid point?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:06.320,00:08:09.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's going to be the average between these two, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:09.320,00:08:12.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I would get here.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:12.320,00:08:16.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,E I K plus 1 for this grid point would be here, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:16.320,00:08:20.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I would get an error that is going to be,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:20.320,00:08:27.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,like this, like that.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:27.320,00:08:28.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:28.320,00:08:36.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I would get a grid by grid oscillation again on the opposite direction.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:36.320,00:08:39.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Great.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:39.320,00:08:46.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is actually not better.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:46.320,00:08:48.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,The convergence rate is actually not better
Dialogue: 0,00:08:48.320,00:08:53.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,than if I just have one smooth solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:53.320,00:08:56.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,The most non-smooth solution possible you can find
Dialogue: 0,00:08:56.320,00:09:00.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,have a very similar convergence rate
Dialogue: 0,00:09:00.320,00:09:02.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,to the most smooth solution,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:02.320,00:09:04.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,except for every iteration,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:04.320,00:09:11.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,the solution area flips its sign.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:11.320,00:09:13.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:13.320,00:09:14.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:14.320,00:09:16.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,That can also be seen mathematically
Dialogue: 0,00:09:16.320,00:09:17.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,through,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:17.320,00:09:21.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,through the same analysis as we did before.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:21.320,00:09:23.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,And mathematically,

Dialogue: 0,00:09:50.320,00:09:54.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Where N is the number of intervals
Dialogue: 0,00:09:54.320,00:09:57.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,and J is the mode.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:57.320,00:10:00.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Last time we focused on the mode
Dialogue: 0,00:10:00.320,00:10:02.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,that corresponds to J equal to 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:02.320,00:10:07.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,That corresponds to the most smooth solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:07.320,00:10:13.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,But equally difficult to converge is

Dialogue: 0,00:10:16.320,00:10:18.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Why is that?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:18.320,00:10:19.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is because

Dialogue: 0,00:10:45.320,00:10:50.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,I also have an eigenvalue very, very close to minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:50.320,00:10:52.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,And it's minus 1 that contributes

Dialogue: 0,00:10:54.320,00:10:57.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,I have an eigenvalue close to minus 1
Dialogue: 0,00:10:57.320,00:10:59.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,that contributes the slow convergence

Dialogue: 0,00:11:04.320,00:11:08.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,The reason we don't see it as much
Dialogue: 0,00:11:08.320,00:11:09.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,in the solution error
Dialogue: 0,00:11:09.320,00:11:12.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,when we perform Jacobi iterations
Dialogue: 0,00:11:12.320,00:11:13.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,is because usually
Dialogue: 0,00:11:13.320,00:11:14.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,in the initial guess,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:14.320,00:11:17.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,usually in the solution error
Dialogue: 0,00:11:17.320,00:11:19.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,of the initial guess,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:19.320,00:11:21.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,the most high-frequency content
Dialogue: 0,00:11:21.320,00:11:23.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,is usually smaller
Dialogue: 0,00:11:23.320,00:11:26.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,than the lowest frequency contents.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:26.320,00:11:28.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So although the high-frequency content
Dialogue: 0,00:11:28.320,00:11:37.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,converges as low as the low-frequency content,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:37.320,00:11:40.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,because initially it is small,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:40.320,00:11:43.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,finally it also is a lot smaller
Dialogue: 0,00:11:43.320,00:11:45.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,than the low-frequency content.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:45.320,00:11:50.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,But in multi-grid,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:50.320,00:11:53.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,that actually becomes very important
Dialogue: 0,00:11:53.320,00:11:56.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,because as we perform iterations
Dialogue: 0,00:11:56.320,00:11:58.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,on the coarse grid,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:58.320,00:12:00.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,we know we are reducing

Dialogue: 0,00:12:06.320,00:12:10.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the ability of the smoother

Dialogue: 0,00:12:19.320,00:12:23.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,becomes very, very important.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:23.320,00:12:25.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,And not only it is important
Dialogue: 0,00:12:25.320,00:12:27.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,in reducing the most non-smooth
Dialogue: 0,00:12:27.320,00:12:29.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,part of the solution,
Dialogue: 0,00:12:29.320,00:12:30.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,because we are applying

Dialogue: 0,00:12:31.320,00:12:33.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,on the successively coarser grids.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:33.320,00:12:35.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,And on the coarser grids,

Dialogue: 0,00:12:37.320,00:12:39.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,of the solution is actually
Dialogue: 0,00:12:39.320,00:12:41.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,contains everything, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:12:41.320,00:12:46.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So no matter what frequency,
Dialogue: 0,00:12:46.320,00:12:49.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,how smooth or non-smooth it is,
Dialogue: 0,00:12:49.320,00:12:51.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,at a certain grid,
Dialogue: 0,00:12:51.320,00:12:53.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,it can be close to the most non-smooth
Dialogue: 0,00:12:53.320,00:12:55.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,part of the solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:55.320,00:12:58.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if your iteration
Dialogue: 0,00:12:58.320,00:13:00.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,is like the Jacobi iteration,
Dialogue: 0,00:13:00.320,00:13:02.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,not very good at reducing
Dialogue: 0,00:13:02.320,00:13:04.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,some non-smooth features
Dialogue: 0,00:13:04.320,00:13:05.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,of the solution,
Dialogue: 0,00:13:05.320,00:13:09.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,then it is not a good smoother.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:09.320,00:13:11.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, it is not,
Dialogue: 0,00:13:11.320,00:13:13.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,a good thing to use in multi-grid.
