Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:05.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So everybody should see a screen like that right now, right? So you can look
Dialogue: 0,00:00:05.080,00:00:12.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,at the project description here. So solve the differential equation partial t
Dialogue: 0,00:00:12.840,00:00:17.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,partial time equal to a times partial square t partial x square plus a right
Dialogue: 0,00:00:17.960,00:00:22.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,hand side. So that's basically our project while we're removing one of the
Dialogue: 0,00:00:22.560,00:00:34.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,terms. And use a, b, and c as specified also tc is here. Initial condition is t
Dialogue: 0,00:00:34.140,00:00:41.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,equal to 325 for all x. Boundary condition is t at times at x equal to 0
Dialogue: 0,00:00:41.100,00:00:46.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,is equal to the same 325 and the right hand side is going to be a
Dialogue: 0,00:00:46.800,00:00:51.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,Newman boundary condition. The derivative is equal to 10.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:52.560,00:01:00.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,And given the solution at t equal to 300 start by writing a function mini
Dialogue: 0,00:01:00.600,00:01:07.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,project 1 where n is the number of grid points which include x equal to 0 and x
Dialogue: 0,00:01:07.260,00:01:18.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,equal to 1 and t is the final time at which the solution is sought. All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:18.300,00:01:22.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,So here we are supposed to write a
Dialogue: 0,00:01:22.520,00:01:22.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,solution. So we are supposed to write a solution. So we are supposed to write a
Dialogue: 0,00:01:22.540,00:01:25.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,function.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:28.500,00:01:38.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,function result is equal to mini project 1, n is the number of grid points
Dialogue: 0,00:01:38.380,00:01:48.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,and what is 300. Oh and t, t is the time. So you are going to code up a functions
Dialogue: 0,00:01:48.880,00:01:52.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,basically assign result to t.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:52.500,00:01:55.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then you are going to write a function. So you are going to write a
