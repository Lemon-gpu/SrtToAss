Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:10.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,So today is lecture 2 and before we begin let me tell you something a little
Dialogue: 0,00:00:10.440,00:00:20.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,bit more logistics. First of all let's open the Stellar website. So this is the
Dialogue: 0,00:00:20.400,00:00:25.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,website I'll be posting all the materials and you're gonna see project
Dialogue: 0,00:00:25.200,00:00:31.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,one is already posted and you should start working on it. I'll go over project
Dialogue: 0,00:00:31.680,00:00:37.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,one pretty soon. There is also collaboration policy, general information
Dialogue: 0,00:00:37.680,00:00:44.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,about the class and a tentative schedule right now posted on Stellar and you can
Dialogue: 0,00:00:44.160,00:00:51.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,look at the schedule and plan ahead a little bit. Lecture one the MATLAB code
Dialogue: 0,00:00:51.720,00:00:55.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,is posted as a zip file. The video recording is a link to
Dialogue: 0,00:00:55.080,00:00:55.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,YouTube.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:55.200,00:01:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And there are two old slides I'm reading. So that's the old slides before I
Dialogue: 0,00:01:02.000,00:01:06.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,changed the lecture style from basically given presentation on
Dialogue: 0,00:01:06.860,00:01:13.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,the screen to actually writing down formulas on my tablet. The reason I
Dialogue: 0,00:01:13.640,00:01:20.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,switched was because it is a lot easier to follow when I write
Dialogue: 0,00:01:20.080,00:01:25.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,things down slowly on the screen. It's just like writing down on
Dialogue: 0,00:01:25.080,00:01:30.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,the blackboard. Well if I just present you the formulas pre-written it's a lot
Dialogue: 0,00:01:30.680,00:01:36.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,easier for me to go too fast. So that's why I switched to handwriting. But of
Dialogue: 0,00:01:36.480,00:01:43.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,course my handwriting is far worse than the typed down latex. So that's why I
Dialogue: 0,00:01:43.400,00:01:50.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,also posted the old slides for you to look at and study by yourself. And also
Dialogue: 0,00:01:50.700,00:01:54.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,the reading is the same thing. It's basically the same as the old
Dialogue: 0,00:01:54.880,00:02:02.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,slides but formatted differently, more like a PDF document. And also this, the
Dialogue: 0,00:02:02.140,00:02:07.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,last PDF slide is actually my worst handwriting lecture notes that I
Dialogue: 0,00:02:07.780,00:02:12.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,actually recorded during the lecture. So these are the stuff I will be posting
Dialogue: 0,00:02:12.580,00:02:18.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,every lecture. And today the only thing different is I also posted a project
Dialogue: 0,00:02:18.840,00:02:23.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,which let me open this up.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:23.500,00:02:24.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the project is called the
Dialogue: 0,00:02:24.860,00:02:24.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Project of the Year. And it's a project that I'm going to be doing for the rest of my life. So the project is called the
Dialogue: 0,00:02:24.880,00:02:28.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,Project of the Year. And it's a project that I'm going to be doing for the rest of my life. So the project is handed out today and it is due
Dialogue: 0,00:02:28.020,00:02:34.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,September 26th. So it's exactly two weeks from now. So you get two weeks to
Dialogue: 0,00:02:34.380,00:02:40.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,work on this project. As I said the project is very different from a typical
Dialogue: 0,00:02:40.380,00:02:47.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,undergraduate assignment. In that like maybe the first question you see like a
Dialogue: 0,00:02:47.280,00:02:54.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,series of questions. Like one, two, three and two bonus questions. So only the first one has
Dialogue: 0,00:02:54.860,00:03:00.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,a right answer. Only the first question is going to have a right answer. So the
Dialogue: 0,00:03:00.580,00:03:08.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,this is basically modeling a bathtub with hot water in it. And the question is
Dialogue: 0,00:03:08.680,00:03:13.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,how should the person be controlling the temperature in the bathtub while wasting
Dialogue: 0,00:03:13.400,00:03:20.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,as little water as possible. And you'll be you'll be writing a code for solving
Dialogue: 0,00:03:20.180,00:03:24.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,the PDE which is given here. It's a little bit more than
Dialogue: 0,00:03:24.840,00:03:30.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,standard advection diffusion equation with the with the right hand side that
Dialogue: 0,00:03:30.520,00:03:38.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,is H over D times T times Tc. And with also pretty standard boundary
Dialogue: 0,00:03:38.560,00:03:43.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,conditions. We'll talk about boundary conditions later. So this one is a Robin
Dialogue: 0,00:03:43.320,00:03:48.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,boundary condition and this the other end is a Newman boundary condition. So the
Dialogue: 0,00:03:48.900,00:03:54.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,questions involves having you derive analytical solution to the PDE.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:54.780,00:04:01.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,Under special conditions. And the analytical solution is going to be used
Dialogue: 0,00:04:01.500,00:04:08.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,when you write a code for solving the PDE numerically. Which is going to be
Dialogue: 0,00:04:08.940,00:04:13.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,working not only for the special case of u equal to constant but for general
Dialogue: 0,00:04:13.440,00:04:19.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,cases. That's the advantage of numerical method is it works for cases where
Dialogue: 0,00:04:19.920,00:04:24.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,analytical solution doesn't exist or maybe it's too difficult.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:24.780,00:04:30.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,But the reason we still want analytical solution is that we can compare our
Dialogue: 0,00:04:30.780,00:04:36.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,numerical solution to the analytical solution for two reasons. One is to make
Dialogue: 0,00:04:36.560,00:04:41.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,sure the code we write is actually working correctly. It's not giving
Dialogue: 0,00:04:41.420,00:04:49.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,completely wrong answers. Two is it allows us to assess the accuracy of our solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:49.580,00:04:54.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,So today we are actually going to be talking about how accurate our solution
Dialogue: 0,00:04:54.620,00:04:54.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,is.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:54.780,00:04:59.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,When we are using finite difference, finite volume, finite element. We are not
Dialogue: 0,00:04:59.880,00:05:05.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,solving the equation exactly. We are approximating the equation. How much
Dialogue: 0,00:05:05.700,00:05:14.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,approximation error is made? Is it case by case? The answer depends case by
Dialogue: 0,00:05:14.520,00:05:18.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,case. So here you're going to use analytical solution to figure out how
Dialogue: 0,00:05:18.420,00:05:22.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,accurate your solution is. And particularly you need to decide by
Dialogue: 0,00:05:22.680,00:05:24.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,yourself. There is no right answer.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:24.620,00:05:31.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,How fine your grid has to be in order to make the decisions you have to make in
Dialogue: 0,00:05:31.760,00:05:38.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,question three. Which is extend your solver to general case and use your
Dialogue: 0,00:05:38.720,00:05:44.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,solver to figure out a strategy. Also there is no right strategy but you
Dialogue: 0,00:05:44.440,00:05:49.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,figure out a strategy that like you can make it as good as possible to have the
Dialogue: 0,00:05:49.860,00:05:54.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,temperature as constant as possible while wasting as much energy. So you can
Dialogue: 0,00:05:54.460,00:05:57.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,do as little water as possible.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:57.300,00:06:03.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay so these three questions if you do all these three perfectly you get full score but
Dialogue: 0,00:06:03.320,00:06:07.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,I have two bonus questions. You can get more than full score so that like at the end of
Dialogue: 0,00:06:07.880,00:06:18.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,the class if you happen to not get full score on some other projects these may be able to
Dialogue: 0,00:06:18.160,00:06:24.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,make up a little bit. So the bonus questions are two parameters in the PDE is on
Dialogue: 0,00:06:24.300,00:06:30.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,certain. How can you design an experiment to figure out what these
Dialogue: 0,00:06:30.920,00:06:40.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,parameters really are and also quantify how your best strategy depends on various
Dialogue: 0,00:06:40.920,00:06:47.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,parameters in the PDE. Alright you can see all these are very open-ended
Dialogue: 0,00:06:47.640,00:06:52.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,questions. There is no single right answer. It's almost asking you to write a paper.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:52.480,00:06:52.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:54.300,00:06:59.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the type of projects we are going to be doing throughout the
Dialogue: 0,00:06:59.640,00:07:03.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,semester and any questions about this particular one?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:03.540,00:07:08.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:08.680,00:07:18.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,How should we provide the answer? Can we provide the answer if we have to do calculations in handwriting or if everything has to be done on the computer?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:18.680,00:07:23.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's a good question. So the question is are you supposed to
Dialogue: 0,00:07:23.540,00:07:24.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,write a paper?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:24.040,00:07:24.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:24.540,00:07:29.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Can you write down your solution in handwriting or it has to be typed on the computer?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:29.540,00:07:36.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the answer to the question is either way is fine. But the submission is going to be in electronic form.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:36.540,00:07:44.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Which means if you choose to handwrite your solution you need to find a scanner and scan them and upload your PDF file.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:44.540,00:07:50.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or you can just use your cell phone. There are pretty good apps to use a cell phone for scanners.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:50.540,00:07:53.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright so the end of the session.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:53.040,00:07:53.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Thank you.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:54.040,00:07:58.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,At the end of this project you'll be submitting two things.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:58.540,00:08:09.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,One is a PDF file that contains basically the entire report and don't include any of your, don't include like your code in the PDF file.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:09.040,00:08:10.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,We won't be looking at them.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:10.540,00:08:17.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,The PDF file is intended to serve pretty much like an academic paper.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:17.040,00:08:20.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the other is a zip file containing all your code.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:20.540,00:08:22.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,And make sure it has all the files that like if somebody wants to use it.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:22.540,00:08:23.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:23.040,00:08:31.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that like if somebody, if our TA looks at your report and see something.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:31.540,00:08:33.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,We won't be running everybody's code.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:33.540,00:08:38.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,But if we see your report and something makes us want to run your code.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:38.040,00:08:41.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Make sure we can run your code.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:41.540,00:08:44.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:44.040,00:08:45.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any other questions?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:45.540,00:08:46.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:46.040,00:08:49.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Does Python code have to do with?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:49.040,00:08:51.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's a very good question.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:51.040,00:08:52.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'll answer this question.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:52.040,00:08:57.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right after I finish discussing this particular project.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:57.040,00:08:59.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Which language we should use.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:59.040,00:09:04.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any other questions about this particular project?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:04.040,00:09:05.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:05.040,00:09:10.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Do we need to upload a separate code for each question or just one?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:10.040,00:09:12.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or a big file?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:12.040,00:09:15.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,You need to, that's a very good question.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:15.040,00:09:19.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we ask you to upload a single zip file.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:19.040,00:09:21.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So they should contain all the code.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:21.040,00:09:28.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I would suggest making a separate directory for each individual question.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:28.040,00:09:33.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,That will make it a lot easier for us to look at your code.
