Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Sounds great. Let's solve it a little bit more.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:06.000,00:00:09.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Solve it for 0.5.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:09.000,00:00:11.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Plot it again.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:11.000,00:00:15.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ah, something bad is happening, huh?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:15.000,00:00:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's take a look at the last solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:18.000,00:00:21.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,bar at u at the end.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:21.000,00:00:23.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,No.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:23.000,00:00:27.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, u end and the column.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:27.000,00:00:29.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes. So this is my solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:29.000,00:00:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I do see I get something similar to what I'm supposed to get, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:34.000,00:00:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So as things run into the shock wave, this part further flattens and I get a shock wave over here.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:40.000,00:00:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,But what about this?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:46.000,00:00:51.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I have artificially generated oscillations.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:51.000,00:00:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right. So why is that the case?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:56.000,00:00:59.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's analyze the central flux scheme.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:59.000,00:01:03.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,A little bit more.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:03.000,00:01:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So first of all, one obvious thing we see is that
Dialogue: 0,00:01:10.000,00:01:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,it doesn't seem to be conserving or decreasing the
Dialogue: 0,00:01:16.000,00:01:19.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,what's called the total variation, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:19.000,00:01:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have the total variation. We see it is diminishing all the time.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:22.000,00:01:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,But over this region, when these oscillations are created,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:26.000,00:01:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,you get a lot of total variation.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:29.000,00:01:31.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Out of nothing, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:31.000,00:01:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is a problem we need to address.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:34.000,00:01:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And this is a particular problem about the central flux scheme.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:38.000,00:01:43.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the reason for that is we can do a different analysis
Dialogue: 0,00:01:43.000,00:01:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,about the central flux scheme
Dialogue: 0,00:01:46.000,00:01:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,where the du bar dt
Dialogue: 0,00:01:54.000,00:01:58.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,is equal to 1 over delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:59.000,00:02:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,times f that's basically
Dialogue: 0,00:02:06.000,00:02:13.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,half of f plus f plus 1 minus
Dialogue: 0,00:02:13.000,00:02:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,oh, this is f plus f minus 1, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:22.000,00:02:27.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,minus half of f plus f plus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:29.000,00:02:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this f gets cancelled with this f here.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:34.000,00:02:37.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have 1 over delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:37.000,00:02:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Actually, 1 over 2 delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:40.000,00:02:45.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,f minus 1 minus f plus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:45.000,00:02:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we're going to find the central difference scheme
Dialogue: 0,00:02:48.000,00:02:51.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,both in finite difference and in finite volume.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:51.000,00:02:55.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,They conserve a certain high order statistics.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:55.000,00:02:57.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let me tell you what that means in a moment.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:57.000,00:03:01.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And f is equal to
Dialogue: 0,00:03:01.000,00:03:05.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the Burgers flux evaluated at u bar i.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:05.000,00:03:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So f is equal to
Dialogue: 0,00:03:08.000,00:03:12.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the Burgers flux evaluated at
Dialogue: 0,00:03:12.000,00:03:15.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,u bar of i minus 1 square
Dialogue: 0,00:03:15.000,00:03:19.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,minus u bar i plus 1 square.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:19.000,00:03:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:20.000,00:03:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the
Dialogue: 0,00:03:22.000,00:03:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,after all the substitution of the Burgers equation
Dialogue: 0,00:03:25.000,00:03:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the central flux,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:26.000,00:03:29.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,what we get.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:29.000,00:03:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:30.000,00:03:33.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:33.000,00:03:35.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,a trick I'm going to do is
Dialogue: 0,00:03:35.000,00:03:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm going to multiply
Dialogue: 0,00:03:38.000,00:03:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,both sides of the equation by
Dialogue: 0,00:03:40.000,00:03:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,u i bar square.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:46.000,00:03:47.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the left hand side is
Dialogue: 0,00:03:47.000,00:03:51.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,u i bar square times d u i bar d t.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:51.000,00:03:55.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The right hand side of the equation is
Dialogue: 0,00:03:55.000,00:03:58.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,1 over 2 delta x
Dialogue: 0,00:03:58.000,00:04:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,half of u bar i minus 1 square
Dialogue: 0,00:04:02.000,00:04:05.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,u bar i square.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:05.000,00:04:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:06.000,00:04:09.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because I multiplied u bar i square on both sides.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:09.000,00:04:13.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Minus u bar i square
Dialogue: 0,00:04:13.000,00:04:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,u bar i plus 1 square.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:16.000,00:04:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,A little bit interesting,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:18.000,00:04:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,but let's make it a little bit more obvious.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:20.000,00:04:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the left hand side is d d t,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:22.000,00:04:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,a third of d d t.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:24.000,00:04:27.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,u bar cube i d t.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:27.000,00:04:29.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The right hand side is
Dialogue: 0,00:04:29.000,00:04:31.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the difference between

Dialogue: 0,00:04:33.000,00:04:37.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,u i 4 delta x
Dialogue: 0,00:04:37.000,00:04:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,minus u i square
Dialogue: 0,00:04:40.000,00:04:43.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,u i plus 1 square
Dialogue: 0,00:04:43.000,00:04:45.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,over 4 delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:45.000,00:04:47.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:47.000,00:04:49.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:49.000,00:04:51.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,this number is exactly
Dialogue: 0,00:04:51.000,00:04:53.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,this number with index i

Dialogue: 0,00:04:58.000,00:04:59.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Which means

Dialogue: 0,00:05:52.000,00:05:53.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So,

Dialogue: 0,00:07:40.000,00:07:43.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,when I have everything runs into a shockwave.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:43.000,00:07:45.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,We can run this further, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:45.000,00:07:47.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, we already have something running to the shockwave.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:47.000,00:07:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,This thing should diminish.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:48.000,00:07:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The shockwave should become zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:50.000,00:07:51.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's smaller and smaller.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:51.000,00:07:53.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,But if we run it further and further,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:53.000,00:07:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we can see that it would never diminish
Dialogue: 0,00:07:56.000,00:07:59.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,because the cube is conserved.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:59.000,00:08:01.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, let's run over five.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:03.000,00:08:05.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ah, failure.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:05.000,00:08:07.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:07.000,00:08:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The discrete has probably become very bad.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:10.000,00:08:13.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Plot this.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:13.000,00:08:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:14.000,00:08:19.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, we get wilder and wilder oscillations
Dialogue: 0,00:08:19.000,00:08:21.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,because the equation has to conserve
Dialogue: 0,00:08:21.000,00:08:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the total amount of u cubed.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:26.000,00:08:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:28.000,00:08:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, it doesn't allow the solution
Dialogue: 0,00:08:30.000,00:08:33.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,to become a nice form like this,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:33.000,00:08:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,which it should be.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:36.000,00:08:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right. So, what we get is...
Dialogue: 0,00:08:38.000,00:08:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ah...
Dialogue: 0,00:08:40.000,00:08:43.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,What we get is...
Dialogue: 0,00:08:43.000,00:08:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, while what we should get is this
Dialogue: 0,00:08:46.000,00:08:47.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,after a while.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:47.000,00:08:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, starting from the initial state,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:48.000,00:08:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,starting from the initial condition,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:50.000,00:08:51.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we should get this.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:51.000,00:08:55.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,But actually, we are getting something like this
Dialogue: 0,00:08:55.000,00:08:57.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,because we have to conserve
Dialogue: 0,00:08:57.000,00:08:59.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the total amount of u cubed.
