Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:04.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So remember last lecture we were solving the Poisson's equation, the partial
Dialogue: 0,00:00:04.320,00:00:14.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,derivative of u to x squared plus a known function f is equal to zero. What
Dialogue: 0,00:00:14.760,00:00:21.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,we did was we integrated this equation with another function, a test function, an
Dialogue: 0,00:00:21.840,00:00:28.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,arbitrary function, arbitrary smooth function. We integrate that over the
Dialogue: 0,00:00:28.140,00:00:34.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,whole computational domain. So let's say from A to B, that has to be equal to 0
Dialogue: 0,00:00:34.060,00:00:40.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,for any V within the certain class of functions. We'll make this certain class
Dialogue: 0,00:00:40.840,00:00:52.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,more rigorous pretty soon.We integrate by parts so if we have u at 0 and 1 both
Dialogue: 0,00:00:52.440,00:00:57.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,equal to 0 then the boundary term that goes into the integrate by parts
Dialogue: 0,00:00:57.980,00:00:58.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,A and b su 무엇 holy well n the boundary terms that goes into the integrate well by parts
Dialogue: 0,00:00:58.120,00:01:06.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,is going to be 0. What we have left is a minus sign of the derivative of v times
Dialogue: 0,00:01:06.820,00:01:18.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,the derivative of u dx and the other term is v times f is going to be 0. This
Dialogue: 0,00:01:18.300,00:01:29.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,is integration by parts and afterwards we represent the u as a summation of
Dialogue: 0,00:01:29.820,00:01:41.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,basis functions and we substitute v with also one of these basis functions and
Dialogue: 0,00:01:41.220,00:01:47.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,from this we pull the summation out of the integral what we get is minus
Dialogue: 0,00:01:47.980,00:01:48.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,f.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:48.280,00:01:57.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,The summation ui of integration of a to b the derivative of i, vi the derivative of vj
Dialogue: 0,00:01:57.940,00:02:07.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,is going to be equal to integration of v times vj of x dx equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:07.960,00:02:17.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if we call this matrix to be aij and this vector to be bj what we get is a ui
Dialogue: 0,00:02:17.960,00:02:19.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,equal to b.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:19.520,00:02:26.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right? And we solve this and we get the solution as a linear combination of
Dialogue: 0,00:02:26.480,00:02:32.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,basis functions. We also started using the basis functions that are piecewise
Dialogue: 0,00:02:32.840,00:02:41.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,linear and continuous so the basis functions are these head functions. We
Dialogue: 0,00:02:41.680,00:02:47.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,derived the formula of aij and bj and let's now start putting them into
Dialogue: 0,00:02:47.020,00:02:47.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,computer to see how they work. So we have a formula of aij and bj and we derived the formula of aij and bj and let's now start putting them into computer to see how they work.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:47.960,00:03:05.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,We started with b, and bj, all the way from the basic model is in the terms of the
Dialogue: 0,00:03:05.180,00:03:05.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,object.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:05.980,00:03:10.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Before I showed you in the past how to do things in f, we had alreadyrades all the
Dialogue: 0,00:03:10.640,00:03:13.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,products, but satisfied requirements of the first method.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:13.440,00:03:14.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's also show that by doing this aij will solve all fundamental questions.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:16.060,00:03:17.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is how aij is blanked.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:17.120,00:03:17.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we start with b.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:17.640,00:03:19.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,something between 0 and 1, which is random.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:20.660,00:03:26.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,And what I will do is I'm going to make a 0 at the first grid point
Dialogue: 0,00:03:26.080,00:03:29.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,and sort x and 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:30.660,00:03:34.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the result is x is going to be increasing,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:34.920,00:03:37.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,but the spacing is random.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:38.300,00:03:38.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:39.920,00:03:43.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what I will do is I'm going to construct the matrix A.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:43.600,00:03:49.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,A is going to be 0s and minus 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:50.160,00:03:52.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,only corresponding to the interior grid points.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:53.640,00:03:58.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,These are the each AIJ correspond to a pair of basis functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:00.100,00:04:06.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the diagonals of A would be equal to
Dialogue: 0,00:04:09.260,00:04:12.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,the diagonals of A is equal to 1 over
Dialogue: 0,00:04:12.800,00:04:13.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,1 over
Dialogue: 0,00:04:13.600,00:04:19.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,xi minus xi minus 1 plus 1 over xi plus 1 minus xi.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:19.900,00:04:22.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's the formula we derived in the last lecture.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:23.120,00:04:29.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's going to be a diagonal of 1 over x.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:30.340,00:04:37.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,It is going to be 3 to n minus x of 2 to n minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:37.460,00:04:39.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's the first part.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:40.740,00:04:43.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's the second part, actually.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:43.600,00:04:50.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the first part is going to be the interval on the left of this grid point.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:51.140,00:04:55.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's going to be 2 to n minus 1 minus 1 to n minus 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:00.100,00:05:02.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think I'm missing one more bracket.

Dialogue: 0,00:05:06.800,00:05:06.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Still.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:10.740,00:05:12.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,I put 1 too many.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:13.600,00:05:14.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,See.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:15.840,00:05:16.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,OK.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:16.220,00:05:17.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Good.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:17.040,00:05:23.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,So A is going to be a matrix whose diagonal is filled.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:23.420,00:05:24.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:24.660,00:05:25.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,OK.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:25.340,00:05:29.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now let's fill the upper and lower diagonals.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:29.620,00:05:40.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,To fill the upper diagonal, we need what we need is the interior delta axis.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:40.640,00:05:42.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,So from 3 to n.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:42.220,00:05:42.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,So from 3 to n.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:42.720,00:05:43.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,So from 3 to n.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:43.100,00:05:43.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,So from 3 to n.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:43.600,00:05:47.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,And minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:47.600,00:05:48.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,Sorry.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:48.100,00:05:52.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,X.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:52.200,00:05:55.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,So these are the delta axis in the interior.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:55.440,00:05:57.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,2 to n minus 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:57.660,00:05:59.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we are going to shift it by 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:59.920,00:06:02.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we are filling out the upper diagonals.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:02.700,00:06:05.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we also shift the same number by minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:05.340,00:06:07.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,We fill the lower diagonals.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:07.280,00:06:10.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,And what we see is that we are constructing a matrix.

Dialogue: 0,00:06:41.380,00:06:42.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So

Dialogue: 0,00:06:42.920,00:06:47.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's also make the number b.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:48.500,00:06:53.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the bi is a vector that depends on...

Dialogue: 0,00:06:56.180,00:07:00.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,I substitute v equal to this, so this should be f times vj.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:00.100,00:07:03.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the bi depends on the right-hand side of the equation f.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:04.400,00:07:06.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's f times vj integrated.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:06.960,00:07:13.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in the case, let's say if f is equal to 1,

Dialogue: 0,00:08:08.380,00:08:11.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have the correct shape of a and b to solve for u.

Dialogue: 0,00:08:31.920,00:08:36.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,u is also going to be a 9 by 1 array.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:36.960,00:08:38.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,And u is going to be a 5 by 2 array.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:38.560,00:08:42.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,These are the linear combination coefficients for the hat functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:44.080,00:08:47.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,So how do I visualize the solution?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:52.540,00:08:55.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Remember, for the hat functions as basis functions,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:56.200,00:09:02.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,the value of the function at the grid points are exactly the linear combination coefficients.

Dialogue: 0,00:09:06.960,00:09:16.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,solution we simply put X and U with zeros at the ends. So now this is our
Dialogue: 0,00:09:16.500,00:09:24.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,solution. This is what our solution looks like. Alright, so this is our solution of
Dialogue: 0,00:09:24.360,00:09:30.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,the equation the second-order derivative of U plus a constant 1 is equal to 0
Dialogue: 0,00:09:30.720,00:09:38.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,with bounded conditions being 0 at the two ends. And let's make it clearer by
Dialogue: 0,00:09:38.420,00:09:46.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,putting the dots. So this is a piecewise linear function and
Dialogue: 0,00:09:46.340,00:09:53.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,the circles are where the grid points are. Now let's see how accurate our
Dialogue: 0,00:09:53.700,00:10:00.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,solution is. This particular equation with F equal to 1 has analytical
Dialogue: 0,00:10:00.700,00:10:10.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,solutions. So for this equation with F equal to 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:10.400,00:10:15.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,what do you think is the analytical solution? It's a parabolic, yes, and that
Dialogue: 0,00:10:15.800,00:10:23.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,both sides are equal to 0. So what kind of parabolic is it going to be? It has a
Dialogue: 0,00:10:23.880,00:10:30.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,curvature of minus 1, right? So you need a half and both sides are equal to 0
Dialogue: 0,00:10:30.700,00:10:40.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,so it's really X times 1 minus X. The second-order derivative is the second-order
Dialogue: 0,00:10:40.840,00:10:45.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,derivative of minus half of X square which is going to be minus 1. And this
Dialogue: 0,00:10:45.220,00:10:53.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,also satisfies both being 0 at the two ends. So let's plot it on top of the
Dialogue: 0,00:10:53.200,00:10:59.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,solution, numerical solution, to see how it looks like. So we'll do hold on and X
Dialogue: 0,00:10:59.840,00:11:00.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,finds...
Dialogue: 0,00:11:00.700,00:11:04.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's say link space of 0 to 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:04.260,00:11:06.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's do 1,000 wrong points.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:07.180,00:11:16.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the legal solution is going to be 0.5 times x times 1 minus x.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:17.720,00:11:23.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,And let's plot x fine and u fine to see what it looks like.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:24.440,00:11:28.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we do get a pretty good solution on the set of random points.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:29.580,00:11:30.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:30.960,00:11:37.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,The red solution is the analytical solution, and the blue one is the numerical solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:38.120,00:11:38.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:38.720,00:11:45.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,So on the grid points, the approximation is pretty good, but within the intervals, of course, we have piecewise linear approximation.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:46.160,00:11:48.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have approximation error here.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:49.220,00:11:50.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,Questions so far about this?
