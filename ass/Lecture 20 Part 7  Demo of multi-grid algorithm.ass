Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:05.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, now here I'm only using two grids.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:05.120,00:00:12.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,How about more? The way to involve more
Dialogue: 0,00:00:12.240,00:00:21.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,grids is on here. So here, instead of only
Dialogue: 0,00:00:21.480,00:00:23.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,performing iterations on the cost grid
Dialogue: 0,00:00:23.520,00:00:26.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,calling Gauss-Seidel, I'm going to make a
Dialogue: 0,00:00:26.040,00:00:28.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,decision of whether just to Gauss-Seidel
Dialogue: 0,00:00:28.520,00:00:33.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,or call multigrid further on. So what I
Dialogue: 0,00:00:33.680,00:00:36.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,will be doing is that I still initialize
Dialogue: 0,00:00:36.080,00:00:39.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,du to zeros and here I have a condition.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:39.400,00:00:46.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,If the size of RC, let's see the first
Dialogue: 0,00:00:46.160,00:00:51.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,dimension, is less than what? First
Dialogue: 0,00:00:51.380,00:00:54.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,dimension, if I have a 2 by 2, I mean the
Dialogue: 0,00:00:54.040,00:00:56.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,only thing that makes sense for me to do
Dialogue: 0,00:00:56.420,00:00:58.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,any iteration would be the size
Dialogue: 0,00:00:58.500,00:01:04.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,would be less or equal to 4, right? So
Dialogue: 0,00:01:04.780,00:01:08.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,if the size is equal to 3, that means I
Dialogue: 0,00:01:08.040,00:01:11.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,have a single grid point in the middle I
Dialogue: 0,00:01:11.280,00:01:18.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,want to solve. So then I do that. Else I
Dialogue: 0,00:01:18.060,00:01:23.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,do du equal to multigrid of du and RC.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:23.700,00:01:26.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm calling this the same function recursively.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:26.500,00:01:27.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm calling this the same function recursively.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:28.500,00:01:32.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now let's see what we get.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:32.280,00:01:38.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, u is equal to u0 again. For i goes
Dialogue: 0,00:01:38.400,00:01:41.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,1, 2, 5. Let's do another five iterations.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:41.260,00:01:49.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,u is equal to multigrid ue. Okay, I'm
Dialogue: 0,00:01:49.800,00:01:55.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,done and let's make figure. I am show u
Dialogue: 0,00:01:55.300,00:01:56.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,title multigrid.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:56.780,00:02:03.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Here is what I get. So this is
Dialogue: 0,00:02:03.560,00:02:06.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,this is like the true solution that I
Dialogue: 0,00:02:06.500,00:02:12.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,have on here and the solution is not
Dialogue: 0,00:02:12.320,00:02:15.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,new folder. I want to view the folder. The
Dialogue: 0,00:02:15.440,00:02:18.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,solution is coming from an image.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:18.920,00:02:23.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,Solution is coming from image airplane dot
Dialogue: 0,00:02:23.600,00:02:26.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,outside of. So this is the image and
Dialogue: 0,00:02:26.620,00:02:29.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,this is the image I copied for the
Dialogue: 0,00:02:29.580,00:02:32.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,solution from and made my right hand
Dialogue: 0,00:02:32.320,00:02:35.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,side according to this as an exact
Dialogue: 0,00:02:35.340,00:02:37.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,solution. And we see like after five
Dialogue: 0,00:02:37.820,00:02:39.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,iterations of multigrid, we get pretty
Dialogue: 0,00:02:39.680,00:02:44.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,much the solution right. So if you think
Dialogue: 0,00:02:44.080,00:02:48.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,of how many regulations is equivalent to
Dialogue: 0,00:02:48.840,00:02:51.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,First of all, the cost grid iterations is
Dialogue: 0,00:02:51.720,00:02:54.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,a lot more cheaper and I'm performing 10
Dialogue: 0,00:02:54.520,00:02:56.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,iterations on every grid level. So 120 English digits.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:56.620,00:03:03.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,means there are 10 levels right so 10 times 10 means each multi-grid iteration
Dialogue: 0,00:03:03.800,00:03:10.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,is like a hundred iterations including from the closest to find it's great and
Dialogue: 0,00:03:10.800,00:03:22.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,if you didn't have multi-grid and you just performing 500 Gauss-Seidel
Dialogue: 0,00:03:22.120,00:03:31.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,iterations first of all it will take longer because all of this 500 is gonna
Dialogue: 0,00:03:31.600,00:03:47.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,be on the finest grid and second if I am show the U title 500 Gauss-Seidel okay
Dialogue: 0,00:03:47.200,00:03:51.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,it still hasn't finished but once it finishes you can see that
Dialogue: 0,00:03:51.240,00:03:52.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,not finished but it's still going to be on the finest grid and then you can see
Dialogue: 0,00:03:52.100,00:04:00.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,the only slower but the effect of 500 Gauss-Seidel is not nearly as good as
Dialogue: 0,00:04:00.020,00:04:09.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,five iterations of multi-grid still going on okay right 500 iterations of
Dialogue: 0,00:04:09.420,00:04:16.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Gauss-Seidel we only get this and with multi-grid we have a cheaper 500
Dialogue: 0,00:04:16.200,00:04:20.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,iterations we get almost the exact solution
