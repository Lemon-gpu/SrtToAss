Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:21.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we are going to say ss is equal to this, and we are going to decide, so let's say f interface is equal to, so let's say is equal to f on the left, so 1, 2, and minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:21.460,00:00:33.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is saying I first choose on the left, and then I'm going to loop for i goes from 1 to length of f interface.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:34.780,00:00:49.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's actually make it easier. So let's say f interface is equal to just an empty array, and so let's do a loop to length of u.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:51.460,00:01:13.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,And f interface, well, let's do it to 2 to the length of u, because we have one less, we are only computing the, we only need to use this upwind formula on the interior interfaces, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:13.320,00:01:21.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so f interface is equal to f interface, and I want to append one more.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:21.460,00:01:39.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the one I want to append would be depend, depend if ss of i minus 1 is greater than 0, then I want to use which side?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:41.900,00:01:51.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,If it's greater than 0, I want to use the left side, yes, I want to use f of i minus 1, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:51.160,00:01:51.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:51.460,00:01:54.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because I'm looping i goes from 2 to the end.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:54.260,00:01:59.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,If I'm looping from i goes from 1 to length of u minus 1, then this would be i.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:00.220,00:02:01.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,This would also be i.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:04.080,00:02:12.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Else f interface is equal to f interface f of i.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:13.940,00:02:17.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any questions about this f interface assignment?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:20.400,00:02:20.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:21.460,00:02:31.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let me make it, let me also append the 0 and 0 at the both ends.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:34.480,00:02:36.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the boundary conditions.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:37.300,00:02:40.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,We use the same boundary conditions as we used last time.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:40.340,00:02:50.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then du dt would be equal to f interface 1 to n minus 1 minus f interface.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:51.460,00:03:05.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,You can also add simple
Dialogue: 0,00:03:05.980,00:03:08.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,step-by-step seguences since we're using the shape that we've already hamstrung our
Dialogue: 0,00:03:08.660,00:03:08.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,tests with, and using the observation común values.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:08.880,00:03:09.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Next we have 2x, which follows f interface.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:09.960,00:03:10.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Having said that, we are blessed to know that f interface follows f demo, so we're more
Dialogue: 0,00:03:11.020,00:03:11.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,launched, but we still have a little more bigger gap.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:11.260,00:03:12.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,in dynamic configuration, for volume and mean width.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:12.200,00:03:12.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,and 2013, x is equal to 2x buy a length of x.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:13.180,00:03:13.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,And all the values are actual by Killer aspect only.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:13.580,00:03:13.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,The only value in душit is.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:13.720,00:03:14.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,If I enter x,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:14.960,00:03:15.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,Great lecture.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:15.520,00:03:16.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,IfI sport,Then the animation changes to give answer of horas innen,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:16.580,00:03:17.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,wives depends on zone previous j value in six block,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:17.120,00:03:17.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,so that the a time kind of we have a De worldly U.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:17.660,00:03:18.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So all right.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:18.420,00:03:19.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,You can go to my have actually run an Threataland
Dialogue: 0,00:03:21.460,00:03:29.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,yeah let's try it so I'm going to use a
Dialogue: 0,00:03:29.380,00:03:37.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,arm so I'm going to use that say again
Dialogue: 0,00:03:37.060,00:03:41.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,the same initial condition x equal to x
Dialogue: 0,00:03:41.320,00:03:47.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,interface is equal to our link space of
Dialogue: 0,00:03:47.560,00:03:53.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,0 1 and let's do 101 so that n is equal
Dialogue: 0,00:03:53.140,00:03:58.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,to 100 so x would be equal to x
Dialogue: 0,00:03:58.880,00:04:03.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,interface 1 to n minus 1 plus x
Dialogue: 0,00:04:03.680,00:04:08.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,interface 2 to n divided by 2 so yeah so
Dialogue: 0,00:04:08.920,00:04:13.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,x is going to be in the middle of the two
Dialogue: 0,00:04:13.240,00:04:15.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,axes I'm going to use u equal to sine of
Dialogue: 0,00:04:15.940,00:04:17.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,x times 2 pi
Dialogue: 0,00:04:17.520,00:04:23.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,so if I plot x and u it'll be this sine
Dialogue: 0,00:04:23.820,00:04:29.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,wave we used in our last lecture okay so
Dialogue: 0,00:04:29.500,00:04:34.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,let's say we set u is equal to u 0
Dialogue: 0,00:04:34.020,00:04:37.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,equal to u transpose that's for OD45
Dialogue: 0,00:04:37.500,00:04:40.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think it accepts a column vector and
Dialogue: 0,00:04:40.200,00:04:46.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,tu is equal to OD45 ddt upwind
Dialogue: 0,00:04:46.400,00:04:47.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,and
Dialogue: 0,00:04:47.400,00:04:50.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,we solve it last time we solve it for
Dialogue: 0,00:04:50.140,00:04:57.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,for 0.1 seconds and u 0 okay so let's do
Dialogue: 0,00:04:57.840,00:05:03.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,close plot x and u so this is still fine
Dialogue: 0,00:05:03.780,00:05:06.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,this is also our last lecture we had the
Dialogue: 0,00:05:06.780,00:05:09.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,same thing but I think we saw a problem
Dialogue: 0,00:05:09.840,00:05:14.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,when we saw it for 0.3 seconds and this
Dialogue: 0,00:05:14.400,00:05:16.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,time when we saw for 0.3 seconds we
Dialogue: 0,00:05:16.900,00:05:19.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,still get a good solution right so so
Dialogue: 0,00:05:19.180,00:05:23.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,let's do and colon so we get a solution
Dialogue: 0,00:05:23.400,00:05:25.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,that has a shockwave sitting in the
Dialogue: 0,00:05:25.680,00:05:28.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,middle and let's actually solve it for
Dialogue: 0,00:05:28.240,00:05:34.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,one second we do the same we see okay we
Dialogue: 0,00:05:34.800,00:05:37.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,get a we got a we got a shockwave and
Dialogue: 0,00:05:37.480,00:05:40.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,the magnitude of this shockwave has
Dialogue: 0,00:05:40.720,00:05:45.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,diminished from size about 1 to all the
Dialogue: 0,00:05:45.280,00:05:46.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,way to 0.4.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:46.900,00:05:51.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,if we plot all the solution at once so
Dialogue: 0,00:05:51.340,00:05:55.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,we see the sine wave goes into the
Dialogue: 0,00:05:55.360,00:05:58.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,shockwave and the shockwave starts to
Dialogue: 0,00:05:58.280,00:05:59.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,decay
Dialogue: 0,00:05:59.140,00:06:03.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,alright so that seems a nice solution
Dialogue: 0,00:06:03.940,00:06:06.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,and you can it's interesting you can see
Dialogue: 0,00:06:06.580,00:06:09.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,also see like how OD45 adapts the
Dialogue: 0,00:06:09.400,00:06:12.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,time step over here initially it chooses
Dialogue: 0,00:06:12.080,00:06:14.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,pretty conservative time step and it
Dialogue: 0,00:06:14.900,00:06:16.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,starts to know it can cause them and
Dialogue: 0,00:06:16.740,00:06:21.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,at this point it's a it starts to also
Dialogue: 0,00:06:21.180,00:06:25.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,when the shockwave forms it looks like
Dialogue: 0,00:06:25.440,00:06:28.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,the time step is decreased also a little
Dialogue: 0,00:06:28.020,00:06:31.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,bit any questions about this upwind
Dialogue: 0,00:06:31.140,00:06:36.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,scheme yes so the error comes from our
Dialogue: 0,00:06:36.300,00:06:40.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,so you can think of several ways to
Dialogue: 0,00:06:40.500,00:06:43.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,think of where the error come from so in
Dialogue: 0,00:06:43.980,00:06:45.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,in a Taylor series analysis
Dialogue: 0,00:06:46.740,00:06:48.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,you can think of the error coming from
Dialogue: 0,00:06:48.600,00:06:52.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,the dispersion we have a second order
Dialogue: 0,00:06:52.200,00:06:55.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,scheme we have we know like a second
Dialogue: 0,00:06:55.620,00:06:56.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,order scheme from our previous
Dialogue: 0,00:06:56.880,00:06:59.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,experience has very little dissipation
Dialogue: 0,00:06:59.500,00:07:03.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,if any and has a lot of dispersion error
Dialogue: 0,00:07:03.660,00:07:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the amount of dispersion error is
Dialogue: 0,00:07:06.000,00:07:09.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,proportional to Delta x square and it's
Dialogue: 0,00:07:09.540,00:07:12.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,also proportional to some derivative of
Dialogue: 0,00:07:12.060,00:07:14.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,the function i think is third order
Dialogue: 0,00:07:14.580,00:07:16.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,derivative if I'm not wrong.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:16.740,00:07:19.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,so so it's proportional to third order
Dialogue: 0,00:07:19.260,00:07:21.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,derivative times Delta x square if you
Dialogue: 0,00:07:21.540,00:07:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,have a discontinuity how big is the
Dialogue: 0,00:07:24.000,00:07:27.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,third order derivative it's going to be
Dialogue: 0,00:07:27.500,00:07:29.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,huge right it's going to be when you
Dialogue: 0,00:07:29.820,00:07:32.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,have something that is very oscillatory
Dialogue: 0,00:07:32.300,00:07:35.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,like like a shockwave you have a very
Dialogue: 0,00:07:35.340,00:07:37.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,very large third order derivative so
Dialogue: 0,00:07:37.520,00:07:39.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,that causes a lot of dispersion error so
Dialogue: 0,00:07:39.940,00:07:42.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,from that perspective last lecture we
Dialogue: 0,00:07:42.680,00:07:45.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,also looked at the central difference
Dialogue: 0,00:07:45.300,00:07:46.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,scheme
Dialogue: 0,00:07:46.180,00:07:50.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,being something that conserves the cubed
Dialogue: 0,00:07:50.800,00:07:56.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,solution so the conservation of these
Dialogue: 0,00:07:56.080,00:07:59.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,higher-order statistics is going to of
Dialogue: 0,00:07:59.860,00:08:02.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,the higher-order quantity is going to
Dialogue: 0,00:08:02.440,00:08:05.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,prevent the solution from getting
Dialogue: 0,00:08:05.320,00:08:09.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,dissipated right because because if you
Dialogue: 0,00:08:09.480,00:08:12.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,have a solution like this at later time
Dialogue: 0,00:08:12.940,00:08:16.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,it definitely has a has a small
Dialogue: 0,00:08:16.180,00:08:20.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,integrated u cubed than the original
Dialogue: 0,00:08:20.620,00:08:24.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,solution that's also something the
Dialogue: 0,00:08:24.880,00:08:28.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,second-order central flux scheme cannot
Dialogue: 0,00:08:28.480,00:08:33.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,capture correctly. The reason for
Dialogue: 0,00:08:33.700,00:08:37.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,choosing that is one it so from
Dialogue: 0,00:08:37.660,00:08:39.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,monumous stability analysis actually
Dialogue: 0,00:08:39.940,00:08:41.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,from the modified equation analysis we
Dialogue: 0,00:08:41.940,00:08:44.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,see that using an up-ending scheme is
Dialogue: 0,00:08:44.560,00:08:45.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,going to
Dialogue: 0,00:08:46.180,00:08:50.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,numerical dissipation right and it is
Dialogue: 0,00:08:50.860,00:08:52.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,actually dissipation that we need over
Dialogue: 0,00:08:52.900,00:08:57.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,here we need the scheme to be dissipated
Dialogue: 0,00:08:57.580,00:09:00.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,by the shockwave the shockwave is
Dialogue: 0,00:09:00.160,00:09:03.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,actually a inherently dissipative
Dialogue: 0,00:09:03.120,00:09:07.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,phenomenon and if you look at a shock
Dialogue: 0,00:09:07.240,00:09:09.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,wave of a real fluid flow of like
Dialogue: 0,00:09:09.520,00:09:13.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,aerodynamics in a supersonic flow the
Dialogue: 0,00:09:13.000,00:09:16.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,shockwave is very very thin so so here
Dialogue: 0,00:09:16.060,00:09:17.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,like mathematically a shockwave is a
Dialogue: 0,00:09:17.860,00:09:21.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,discontinuity in a real physics you
Dialogue: 0,00:09:21.580,00:09:23.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,don't really have any discontinuities
Dialogue: 0,00:09:23.920,00:09:25.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,but you have something extremely thin
Dialogue: 0,00:09:25.600,00:09:28.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's so thin that the shockwave is on
Dialogue: 0,00:09:28.300,00:09:32.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,the order of like 10 to 100 of the the
Dialogue: 0,00:09:32.140,00:09:34.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,mean free path of the molecules so it's
Dialogue: 0,00:09:34.240,00:09:36.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,like really really small and the
Dialogue: 0,00:09:36.500,00:09:38.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,dissipation although the shockwave is
Dialogue: 0,00:09:38.800,00:09:41.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,very thin the amount of physical
Dialogue: 0,00:09:41.180,00:09:44.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,dissipation occurring during inside the
Dialogue: 0,00:09:44.140,00:09:45.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,shockwave is is massive.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:46.060,00:09:48.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's just because the length scale is
Dialogue: 0,00:09:48.340,00:09:50.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,so small and molecules from one side
Dialogue: 0,00:09:50.260,00:09:52.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,goes to the other side and they mix
Dialogue: 0,00:09:52.720,00:09:55.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,together the amount of dissipation it's
Dialogue: 0,00:09:55.540,00:09:57.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,so a lot of dissipation is appearing
Dialogue: 0,00:09:57.440,00:10:00.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,there so even though we have an inviscid
Dialogue: 0,00:10:00.840,00:10:02.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,equation we approximate the equation as
Dialogue: 0,00:10:02.920,00:10:05.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,inviscid there is still a lot of
Dialogue: 0,00:10:05.440,00:10:07.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,dissipation going on at discontinuities
Dialogue: 0,00:10:07.720,00:10:11.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,and that is like the physical reason why
Dialogue: 0,00:10:11.020,00:10:15.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,we need a dissipative scheme to resolve
Dialogue: 0,00:10:15.460,00:10:20.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,discontinuities. That satisfies what you
Dialogue: 0,00:10:20.140,00:10:27.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,are curious about. Any other questions?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:27.580,00:10:30.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,And in fact a lot of modern numerical
Dialogue: 0,00:10:30.780,00:10:33.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,methods they are trying to be high order
Dialogue: 0,00:10:33.100,00:10:34.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,away from the shockwaves but at the
Dialogue: 0,00:10:34.980,00:10:37.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,shockwaves you need a lot of numerical
Dialogue: 0,00:10:37.240,00:10:39.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,dissipation because you can never be
Dialogue: 0,00:10:39.400,00:10:41.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,your grid can never resolve the shockwave.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:41.860,00:10:43.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,If your grid can resolve the
Dialogue: 0,00:10:43.900,00:10:45.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,shockwave if your grid size is
Dialogue: 0,00:10:45.460,00:10:47.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,actually like ten times the mean free
Dialogue: 0,00:10:47.980,00:10:50.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,path of the molecules you don't need any
Dialogue: 0,00:10:50.260,00:10:52.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,numerical dissipations you just need
Dialogue: 0,00:10:52.600,00:10:55.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,physical dissipations you put the amount
Dialogue: 0,00:10:55.240,00:10:58.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,of viscosity of air into the scheme and
Dialogue: 0,00:10:58.720,00:11:01.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,you can have the appropriate amount of
Dialogue: 0,00:11:01.060,00:11:03.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,dissipation but your grid can never
Dialogue: 0,00:11:03.200,00:11:05.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,resolve that so that in that case you
Dialogue: 0,00:11:05.440,00:11:07.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,need numerical dissipation to do the
Dialogue: 0,00:11:07.300,00:11:10.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,same amount of work. Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:10.120,00:11:14.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,If your grid could resolve that can you just use one more difference?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:14.140,00:11:15.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,If your grid can resolve that, yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:15.460,00:11:17.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,You can use finite differencing and
Dialogue: 0,00:11:17.680,00:11:21.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,with not with not with this equation
Dialogue: 0,00:11:21.220,00:11:23.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,but with the equation that includes the
Dialogue: 0,00:11:23.620,00:11:26.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,physical viscosity so include a second
Dialogue: 0,00:11:26.460,00:11:29.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,order derivative in x term and then you
Dialogue: 0,00:11:29.440,00:11:31.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,can yeah you can use finite difference
Dialogue: 0,00:11:31.000,00:11:33.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,you actually converge to a real
