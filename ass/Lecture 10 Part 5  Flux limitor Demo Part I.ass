Dialogue: 0,00:00:03.420,00:00:11.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,MATLAB and try to implement at least
Dialogue: 0,00:00:11.220,00:00:14.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,one of the limiters and see how to

Dialogue: 0,00:00:54.260,00:01:00.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,so we are going to reconstruct u of i
Dialogue: 0,00:01:00.380,00:01:08.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,plus half and left and we are going to
Dialogue: 0,00:01:08.720,00:01:11.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,also reconstruct the u of i plus half
Dialogue: 0,00:01:11.360,00:01:12.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,right
Dialogue: 0,00:01:12.500,00:01:18.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,alright and once we reconstruct this we
Dialogue: 0,00:01:18.440,00:01:21.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,are going to apply apply good enough
Dialogue: 0,00:01:21.260,00:01:23.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,scheme
Dialogue: 0,00:01:24.260,00:01:32.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,to compute f and this is f at the
Dialogue: 0,00:01:32.500,00:01:36.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,interfaces and I'm going to say f is
Dialogue: 0,00:01:36.620,00:01:42.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,equal to 0 f 0 so that gets us are gives
Dialogue: 0,00:01:42.860,00:01:46.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,us all the boundaries we need and the
Dialogue: 0,00:01:46.140,00:01:49.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,du dt would be equal to for any final

Dialogue: 0,00:02:01.360,00:02:05.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,so that's the grand scheme of how to
Dialogue: 0,00:02:05.360,00:02:10.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,compute things so before we do any
Dialogue: 0,00:02:10.500,00:02:13.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,reconstruction that's compute the ui
Dialogue: 0,00:02:13.960,00:02:22.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,minus 1 and ui the ui and ui-1s right so
Dialogue: 0,00:02:22.500,00:02:26.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's consider ui plus half left.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:27.100,00:02:38.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,We first do ui minus 1 is equal to, so let's still imagine zero bounded conditions.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:38.360,00:02:41.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,We put zero and u of 1 to n minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:42.540,00:02:44.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is my ui minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:44.860,00:02:47.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm just constructing this as an array.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:48.660,00:02:48.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:48.980,00:02:52.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I also need ui plus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:55.380,00:02:58.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,It is equal to u from 2 to n.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:00.560,00:03:03.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I also put a zero at the end.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:03.360,00:03:05.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's the value beyond the boundary.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:06.140,00:03:06.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:08.140,00:03:17.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,So my ratio here would be ui plus 1 minus ui.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:18.720,00:03:18.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:19.040,00:03:31.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Divide by ui minus 1, u minus ui minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:31.900,00:03:33.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is my r.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:34.280,00:03:34.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:35.760,00:03:37.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if I use Van Leer limiter.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:38.420,00:03:41.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's just use a general limiter function.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:41.520,00:03:45.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,phi is equal to limiter of r.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:45.580,00:03:47.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to write a limiter here.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:47.360,00:03:49.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to write a function.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:50.100,00:03:54.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,phi is equal to limiter r.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:56.640,00:03:57.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:58.000,00:04:00.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for example, if I want the Van Leer limiter,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:01.860,00:04:08.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,I would be saying phi is going to be equal to,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:10.480,00:04:13.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,let's look at what we have.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:13.380,00:04:16.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's either zero or 2r divided by 1 plus r.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:16.580,00:04:21.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's first compute 2r divided by 1 plus r.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:23.080,00:04:29.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,And phi of whenever r is less or equal to zero would be equal to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:30.280,00:04:31.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:33.060,00:04:40.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,Another case we want to take care of is when r is going to be a zero divided by zero,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:40.780,00:04:41.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is not a number.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:43.520,00:04:46.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,So phi of any not is finite.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:46.580,00:04:50.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if I write r, I'm going to set it to zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:50.520,00:04:55.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because remember when we actually use the limiter,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:55.160,00:04:59.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,phi is going to be multiplied with the difference.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:00.240,00:05:00.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Where is phi?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:01.920,00:05:08.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,When we use the limiter, phi is going to be multiplied with the ui minus ui minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:08.560,00:05:13.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if we get a divide by zero, we are also in r.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:13.320,00:05:16.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,When we use phi, phi is going to be multiplied by 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:16.360,00:05:18.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So phi is going to be multiplied by zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:18.860,00:05:22.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in that case, when r is equal to not a number infinity,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:22.860,00:05:26.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,it doesn't matter what the value of phi is as long as it's not a number.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:26.860,00:05:27.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,I am fine.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:27.360,00:05:31.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is going to be my implementation of the Van Leer Limiter.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:31.860,00:05:32.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any questions?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:32.860,00:05:35.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Pardon?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:35.860,00:05:39.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Line 9 has to be dotted by line 9.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:39.860,00:05:40.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Line 9?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:40.860,00:05:41.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:41.860,00:05:42.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Thank you.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:42.860,00:05:43.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:43.860,00:05:44.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:44.860,00:05:45.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what we're going to do is we're going to do a little bit of a test.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:45.860,00:05:53.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,So once I compute the phi, I can compute ui plus half left.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:53.360,00:06:07.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's going to be, according to my formula, it's going to be ui plus half of ui minus ui minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:10.360,00:06:14.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,ui minus ui minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:14.360,00:06:17.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I'm going to compute the next one, which is ui plus 1, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:17.860,00:06:20.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,times my phi.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:20.860,00:06:26.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,That completes my reconstruction of the flux at the left.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:28.360,00:06:32.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,Reconstructing the flux at the right is very similar, but I go from the right.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:32.360,00:06:37.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,So instead of ui minus 1, so I already have ui minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:37.360,00:06:43.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what I need here, the equivalence of ui minus 1 is ui plus 2, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:44.360,00:06:49.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's the cell away on the right and away from the interface.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:49.600,00:06:55.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's equal to ui plus 1, 2 to the end, 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:57.580,00:07:01.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I further shifted using ui plus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:03.600,00:07:04.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:05.260,00:07:13.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,And my r in this case is going to be...
Dialogue: 0,00:07:13.600,00:07:19.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, instead of ui plus 1 minus u, I have ui minus 1 minus...
Dialogue: 0,00:07:20.240,00:07:22.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Wait, is that ui plus 1?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:23.060,00:07:23.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:25.000,00:07:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let me write down the formula first for the right reconstruction.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:40.000,00:07:40.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,Otherwise...
Dialogue: 0,00:07:40.480,00:07:43.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,So ui plus half left.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:43.600,00:07:51.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is equal to ui plus ui minus ui minus 1 divided by 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:51.660,00:07:53.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's the slope times dx.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:54.940,00:08:03.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Times phi of ui plus 1 minus ui divided by ui minus ui minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:04.280,00:08:09.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,And ui plus half from the right is equal to...
Dialogue: 0,00:08:09.600,00:08:13.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,In this case, i plus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:13.600,00:08:15.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,i plus 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:16.220,00:08:22.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is going to be playing the role of ui minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:23.120,00:08:26.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ui plus 1 is going to play the role of ui.

Dialogue: 0,00:08:31.480,00:08:34.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,i is going to play the role of ui plus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:34.700,00:08:34.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:37.060,00:08:38.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm looking at here.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:38.420,00:08:43.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,When I'm constructing the left, I'm looking at these three cells.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:43.600,00:08:47.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,So when I'm constructing the right, I'm looking at these three cells.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:48.540,00:08:54.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,So on the right would be ui plus 1 plus half of...

Dialogue: 0,00:09:24.420,00:09:25.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,Does it make sense?
