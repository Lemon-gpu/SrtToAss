Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:07.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,partial square u partial x is approximated by the finite difference
Dialogue: 0,00:00:07.320,00:00:16.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,operator ui plus 1 plus ui minus 1 minus 2 ui divided by delta x square. And then
Dialogue: 0,00:00:16.280,00:00:23.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,we worked out the truncation error and if you remember we wrote down ui plus 1
Dialogue: 0,00:00:23.080,00:00:31.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,over delta x square ui minus 1 over delta x square and the minus 2 ui over
Dialogue: 0,00:00:31.360,00:00:40.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,delta x square and minus partial square u partial x square. So this formula if I
Dialogue: 0,00:00:40.780,00:00:51.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,put a plus over here is the error of that approximation. Right so this is
Dialogue: 0,00:00:51.220,00:00:53.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,equal to tau
Dialogue: 0,00:00:53.040,00:01:01.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,and how do we figure out how large or how small tau is? We did an expansion
Dialogue: 0,00:01:01.140,00:01:11.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,over Taylor series. Right we expanded what is the term that contains ui. So for
Dialogue: 0,00:01:11.100,00:01:18.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,example this is just ui this is also just a ui this is minus 2 ui over delta x
Dialogue: 0,00:01:18.900,00:01:23.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,square this is 0 so that cancel out to be 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:23.000,00:01:23.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is minus 2 ui over delta x square this is 0 so that cancel out to be 0. So that cancel out to be 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:23.020,00:01:31.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,We also have a ui prime part which is the first derivative and that turns out
Dialogue: 0,00:01:31.000,00:01:39.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,to be that and this turns out to be minus that. There is no square because
Dialogue: 0,00:01:39.580,00:01:46.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,one of the squares cancel out and 0 0 we get 0. And so we also use Taylor series
Dialogue: 0,00:01:46.860,00:01:52.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,to expand this part this part this is also going to be 0 this is
Dialogue: 0,00:01:52.980,00:02:00.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,going to be just itself and we also get 0 and this one we also get 0 and only
Dialogue: 0,00:02:00.360,00:02:06.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,in the in this term we get something that is proportional to delta x to the
Dialogue: 0,00:02:06.300,00:02:14.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,fourth. That means our approximation error I think sorry delta x to the fourth
Dialogue: 0,00:02:14.880,00:02:20.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,also divided by delta x square which gets to delta x square right that means
Dialogue: 0,00:02:20.760,00:02:22.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,our approximation error is equal to delta x squared. So this is our approximation error.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:22.940,00:02:32.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,is we write it as big O times delta x to the fourth to the second sorry to the
Dialogue: 0,00:02:32.320,00:02:39.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,second because the fourth cancels with the second. What this big O notation
Dialogue: 0,00:02:39.080,00:02:48.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,means is that as delta x goes to 0 the rate of decay of this truncation error
Dialogue: 0,00:02:48.920,00:02:52.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,is delta x squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:52.900,00:03:00.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay this means this is equal to a constant let me write down as c2 times x
Dialogue: 0,00:03:00.120,00:03:07.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,squared plus maybe another constant times delta x cubed plus maybe another
Dialogue: 0,00:03:07.280,00:03:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,constant times delta x fourth etc. But we don't really care that much about c3 c4
Dialogue: 0,00:03:14.000,00:03:21.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,etc. because when delta x is small enough all of these we call high-order terms is
Dialogue: 0,00:03:21.300,00:03:22.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,going to be negligible.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:22.900,00:03:31.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,Compared to the delta x squared term right. So if you look at this truncation
Dialogue: 0,00:03:31.400,00:03:40.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,error we'd like usually to plot it in a log-log plot. In this log-log plot the x
Dialogue: 0,00:03:40.620,00:03:49.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,axis is our delta x. The y-axis let's say here we used to denote the truncation
Dialogue: 0,00:03:49.160,00:03:51.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,error tau.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:52.900,00:04:02.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay and let's say our delta x is 1 over here is 0.1 over here is 0.01 over here
Dialogue: 0,00:04:02.140,00:04:12.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,10 to the minus 4 over here actually 3 over here 10 to the minus 4 over here 10
Dialogue: 0,00:04:12.040,00:04:20.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,to the minus 5 over here. If when delta x is equal to 1 the truncation error is
Dialogue: 0,00:04:20.940,00:04:21.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,over here.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:22.900,00:04:30.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,When delta x decreases to 0.1 maybe the truncation error is over here but at
Dialogue: 0,00:04:30.580,00:04:31.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,some point
Dialogue: 0,00:04:31.660,00:04:35.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,tau is going to decay when delta x is small enough.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:35.580,00:04:42.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Tau is going to decay like delta x squared. That rate of decay in a log-log
Dialogue: 0,00:04:42.640,00:04:43.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,plot
Dialogue: 0,00:04:43.480,00:04:49.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,what would it look like? What is going to be the slope? It's going to be 2. Yes
Dialogue: 0,00:04:49.140,00:04:52.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,which means let's say if the decay the correct decay
Dialogue: 0,00:04:52.900,00:05:01.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,rate starts from here then when delta x becomes 0.01 what is going to be the
Dialogue: 0,00:05:01.660,00:05:11.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,error? What is going to be tau? So if you go over a factor of 10 over here you
Dialogue: 0,00:05:11.480,00:05:19.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,should go over two factors of 10 in the y-axis right so you should get to here.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:19.520,00:05:22.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So your decay rate should be like that.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:23.860,00:05:31.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right. So that is that is the correct line for tau
Dialogue: 0,00:05:32.580,00:05:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,being Big-O delta x squared
Dialogue: 0,00:05:39.380,00:05:40.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:43.600,00:05:48.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,A similar analysis can be used to look at the solution error
Dialogue: 0,00:05:51.220,00:05:52.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,and for example you are a project
Dialogue: 0,00:05:52.420,00:05:52.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,you
Dialogue: 0,00:05:52.820,00:05:58.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,compare a numerical solution with analytical solution. And the difference
Dialogue: 0,00:05:58.820,00:06:03.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,the difference between analytical and numerical solution can also be
Dialogue: 0,00:06:03.460,00:06:09.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,quantified in a similar way as you refine your grid. And if for example you
Dialogue: 0,00:06:09.200,00:06:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,know your scheme its second order and your solution is second order, then as
Dialogue: 0,00:06:18.000,00:06:23.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,you refine the grid, as you increase the n decrease the delta x, you should find
Dialogue: 0,00:06:23.640,00:06:30.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,your solution error to decay in that rate. And if you are careful you should
Dialogue: 0,00:06:30.240,00:06:37.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,actually plot it using MATLAB and see if the slope is actually 2. If your slope
Dialogue: 0,00:06:37.320,00:06:43.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,is 1, that means you probably have a bug somewhere that makes your scheme not
Dialogue: 0,00:06:43.400,00:06:47.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,really second order. It's going to be a first order scheme.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:47.720,00:06:47.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's the first order scheme.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:48.000,00:06:59.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright, for example, an example of a first order scheme can be seen as
Dialogue: 0,00:06:59.580,00:07:05.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,discretizing the first order derivative. Let me say the most intuitive
Dialogue: 0,00:07:05.960,00:07:13.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,way to discretize it is ui plus 1 minus ui divided by delta x. I mean one of the
Dialogue: 0,00:07:13.160,00:07:17.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,intuitive way to discretize it. Now if you look at the
Dialogue: 0,00:07:17.840,00:07:17.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,ability to discretize a derivative, the first order derivative is actually 1 for the derivative, so it's not 2 for the derivative. So if you look at the
Dialogue: 0,00:07:17.960,00:07:27.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,approximation error, we have ui minus ui over delta x plus ui plus 1 over delta x,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:27.620,00:07:35.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we subtract this numerical approximation from the analytical
Dialogue: 0,00:07:35.200,00:07:42.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,derivative it tries to approximate. This is equal to tau. We do Taylor series and
Dialogue: 0,00:07:42.240,00:07:53.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,this term is just itself. This term is ui over delta x, plus ui over times delta x
Dialogue: 0,00:07:53.580,00:08:00.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,divided by delta x. So nothing. just a ui prime. Alright and we also have
Dialogue: 0,00:08:00.180,00:08:05.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,a second order derivative. It is going to be half like 2 factorial which is 2
Dialogue: 0,00:08:05.940,00:08:11.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,delta x times ui double prime. and plus
Dialogue: 0,00:08:11.760,00:08:12.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,...
Dialogue: 0,00:08:12.180,00:08:12.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we subtract all the Vid przygot Anyways, the nulls, theals and the putims, all are the same.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:12.220,00:08:19.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,Delta x squared over 6, that's 3 factorial ui third derivative, etc.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:20.060,00:08:21.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,And here is 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:22.720,00:08:25.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any questions about the Taylor series of ui plus 1?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:26.860,00:08:32.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I'm writing down very quickly, but once you start going into this class,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:33.180,00:08:36.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,you should be able to do Taylor series analysis as quickly.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:37.840,00:08:42.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,Once you exercise it, it becomes really natural.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:43.220,00:08:50.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is 0, this is just a minus ui prime, so this is at xi, and 0, 0, etc.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:51.440,00:08:59.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you add them together, look at tau, the first term cancels, 0, as it should be.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:00.600,00:09:05.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,The second term cancels, 0, as it should be.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:06.200,00:09:09.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,The third term no longer cancels.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:10.220,00:09:12.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that is going to be the leading term.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:12.760,00:09:14.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,The leading term in the truncation error.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:15.260,00:09:21.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,That is ui double prime times half of second derivative of u.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:22.760,00:09:27.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright, so in this case, my tau is all what?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:30.760,00:09:32.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Just delta x, no square.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:33.760,00:09:34.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:35.760,00:09:41.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if you look over here, if I have a truncation error that decays like delta x,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:42.760,00:09:43.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,what should I have?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:44.980,00:09:50.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,If I have truncation error decay like delta x, I should have a line that is of slope 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:51.060,00:09:55.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,If it's here, then as you decrease by a factor of 10, you should become,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:56.220,00:09:58.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,the tau should also decay by a factor of 10.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:58.380,00:10:02.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you should get a line that is shallower than the red line.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:04.600,00:10:05.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,Question?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:05.720,00:10:09.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you approximated ddx,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:10.060,00:10:11.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,you did a good job.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:11.220,00:10:12.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:12.380,00:10:16.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you were estimating ui plus 1 minus ui minus 1 by 2 delta x,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:16.880,00:10:20.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,wouldn't you get more cancellation if you decrease it out?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:20.880,00:10:21.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's a good point.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:22.220,00:10:22.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:22.980,00:10:37.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the question is, if I discretize this using, instead of ui plus 1 and ui,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:38.220,00:10:40.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,if I approximate using ui plus 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:40.980,00:10:41.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,if I approximate using ui plus 1 and ui,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:41.980,00:10:45.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,then I divide by 2 delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:45.980,00:10:51.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you do the Taylor series again, it's a little bit more involved.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:51.980,00:10:56.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,You're going to find I'm also going to cancel a u delta x term.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:56.980,00:11:02.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm going to get discretization error that is proportional to delta x squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:02.980,00:11:03.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,You're right.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:03.980,00:11:06.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,The exercise is left at home.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:06.980,00:11:07.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:07.980,00:11:10.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:10.980,00:11:14.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you want second order scheme in your project, for example,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:14.980,00:11:17.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,this is probably what you should be using.
