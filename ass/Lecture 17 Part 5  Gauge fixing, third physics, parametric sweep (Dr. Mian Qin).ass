Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:02.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,One second.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:02.760,00:00:04.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Actually record this one.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:04.120,00:00:07.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for example, if you have a fluid flow problem, what you
Dialogue: 0,00:00:07.720,00:00:10.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,care about is the velocity field and the pressure field.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:10.520,00:00:15.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,And sometimes a typical mistake people make is they
Dialogue: 0,00:00:15.120,00:00:16.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,say, what is the velocity input?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:16.800,00:00:18.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,What's the flow rate output?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:18.080,00:00:18.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Things like that.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:18.760,00:00:21.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,But they forget to give a pressure constraint.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:21.880,00:00:25.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So then basically it's not a unique solution system.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:25.640,00:00:28.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,You could have the pressure adding any constant to the
Dialogue: 0,00:00:28.800,00:00:31.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,entire system and it'll still be the solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:31.160,00:00:33.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in that case, COMSOL either cannot give you a converged
Dialogue: 0,00:00:33.640,00:00:35.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,solution or it'll give you an arbitrary solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:35.940,00:00:39.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the better way, a more predictive way of getting a
Dialogue: 0,00:00:39.620,00:00:42.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,right result is to add a pressure point constraint on
Dialogue: 0,00:00:42.520,00:00:44.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,one of the points, like a gauge fixing.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:44.940,00:00:49.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then same for the electric problem as well, actually.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:49.200,00:00:52.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you do have the current, like input current of 1 amp
Dialogue: 0,00:00:52.260,00:00:56.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,and output current, but you don't give a reference point,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:56.240,00:00:58.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,then you have the same situation.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:58.000,00:00:58.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you do want to
Dialogue: 0,00:00:58.780,00:01:00.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,have the constraint just one point.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:00.780,00:01:03.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you can easily do so by right click and then add a
Dialogue: 0,00:01:03.500,00:01:06.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,point condition and then add a ground somewhere in the system
Dialogue: 0,00:01:06.540,00:01:09.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,or any kind of potential.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:09.120,00:01:11.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,And sometimes you actually, for example, don't know what
Dialogue: 0,00:01:11.920,00:01:15.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,is the reference point, but then you know kind of like a
Dialogue: 0,00:01:15.620,00:01:16.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,floating potential.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:16.580,00:01:18.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we do have other conditions.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:18.400,00:01:21.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm not too familiar with the ACDC part of it, but we do
Dialogue: 0,00:01:21.580,00:01:25.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,have different terminal types, floating potential, and other
Dialogue: 0,00:01:25.060,00:01:26.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,things you can use.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:26.600,00:01:27.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,But you're very right.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:27.980,00:01:31.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,So a lot of times in physical world, we think in the very
Dialogue: 0,00:01:31.700,00:01:33.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,physics intuition kind of way.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:33.120,00:01:35.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,But in the numerical world, then it's interpreted
Dialogue: 0,00:01:35.920,00:01:37.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,differently, and you have to think from a mathematical
Dialogue: 0,00:01:37.860,00:01:40.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,point of view and how the machine actually understands
Dialogue: 0,00:01:40.920,00:01:42.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,those information.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:42.940,00:01:46.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Another important point, since you mentioned, is for
Dialogue: 0,00:01:46.200,00:01:49.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,numerical solutions, so far can we trust the results?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:49.780,00:01:54.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,Can we trust that 768, 568?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:54.720,00:01:55.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,Maybe.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:55.660,00:01:56.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,But I wouldn't trust it to the digits.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:56.860,00:01:57.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to try to do that.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:57.860,00:02:01.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because so far, we're using a relatively coarse mesh.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:01.860,00:02:04.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in numerical studies, what you always want to do is you
Dialogue: 0,00:02:04.580,00:02:08.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,can start with a coarse mesh so that you solve faster.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:08.480,00:02:12.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then after you do that, refine the mesh a couple times,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:12.020,00:02:14.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,actually, more than a couple times, and make sure that the
Dialogue: 0,00:02:14.260,00:02:16.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,solution doesn't change according to the mesh density.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:16.840,00:02:18.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then you know you actually eliminated the numerical
Dialogue: 0,00:02:18.760,00:02:20.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,artifacts, and you're actually looking at a converged
Dialogue: 0,00:02:20.940,00:02:21.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:21.720,00:02:24.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,Of course, the engineers have different tolerances of errors.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:24.340,00:02:27.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you'll see the asymptotic limits as you refine the mesh.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:27.860,00:02:31.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then you can determine, oh, just use less memory and be happy
Dialogue: 0,00:02:31.360,00:02:32.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,with that 5% error.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:32.640,00:02:36.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that is your call in terms of how fine, eventually, you want
Dialogue: 0,00:02:36.420,00:02:38.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,to match the geometry.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:38.780,00:02:41.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,There would be another approach, which is actually under the
Dialogue: 0,00:02:41.740,00:02:46.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,solver setting, a more automatic way, which is to add adaptive
Dialogue: 0,00:02:46.520,00:02:47.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,mesh refinement.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:47.780,00:02:50.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,So basically, what it does is, depending on what error estimate
Dialogue: 0,00:02:50.900,00:02:53.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,you gave, what tolerance you gave, it'll automatically insert
Dialogue: 0,00:02:53.840,00:02:55.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,mesh points where necessary, say, where the gradient is high, where
Dialogue: 0,00:02:55.860,00:02:56.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,the gradient is high.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:56.860,00:02:57.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,You know, where the gradient is high.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:57.860,00:03:00.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,So where you see a lot of things happening.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:00.740,00:03:03.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then that is going to be more memory intensive.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:03.440,00:03:05.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,But it's going to be more efficient in terms of
Dialogue: 0,00:03:05.500,00:03:06.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,determining where to insert a mesh.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:06.920,00:03:09.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because otherwise, you can do a local refinement in the manual
Dialogue: 0,00:03:09.800,00:03:12.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,way, which will take you more time in terms of choosing which
Dialogue: 0,00:03:12.440,00:03:15.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,region to refine and how fine to actually, how many
Dialogue: 0,00:03:15.980,00:03:17.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,iterations to refine.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:17.240,00:03:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So yeah, something that comes in handy.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:22.900,00:03:24.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right, so that's the second physics.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:24.860,00:03:27.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,We'll go through the third physics really quick.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:27.480,00:03:32.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,By, again, right click on component one, add physics.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:32.220,00:03:36.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we are going to choose structural mechanics, solid
Dialogue: 0,00:03:36.780,00:03:39.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,mechanics in phase, add it to the component.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:39.880,00:03:41.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,So by now, you already know the drill, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:41.820,00:03:44.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,You close the physics panel.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:44.040,00:03:45.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,You have the solid mechanics here.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:45.300,00:03:47.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,You have three default nodes, a default boundary condition.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:47.880,00:03:49.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Sorry, default boundary condition, free to move
Dialogue: 0,00:03:49.760,00:03:52.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,everywhere, default governing equation of linear elastic
Dialogue: 0,00:03:52.620,00:03:53.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,material.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:53.140,00:03:57.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you want to change that, add non-linearity or pre-structural.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:57.480,00:04:00.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if you want to change that, add non-linearity or pre-structural.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:00.080,00:04:03.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,And you can also do it by using the thermal stress, or thermal
Dialogue: 0,00:04:03.060,00:04:03.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,stress.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:03.480,00:04:05.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,You do the right click on the material.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:05.620,00:04:09.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in this case, we're going to just add a thermal expansion.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:09.380,00:04:12.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,And say the temperature calculation for thermal
Dialogue: 0,00:04:12.120,00:04:14.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,expansion comes from the heat transfer physics.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:14.560,00:04:16.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then that's it.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:16.340,00:04:20.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's how we tied the second physics to the third one.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:20.040,00:04:23.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then the free to deform everywhere, again, that's not
Dialogue: 0,00:04:23.700,00:04:24.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,enough constraint.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:24.800,00:04:26.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,Another example, actually, for constraint
Dialogue: 0,00:04:26.800,00:04:30.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,is the number of degrees of freedom there are if it's a
Dialogue: 0,00:04:30.040,00:04:32.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,rigid body.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:32.300,00:04:33.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,More or less rigid.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:33.620,00:04:34.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Six, that's right.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:34.560,00:04:35.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:35.160,00:04:37.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,So how do you have a unique solution?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:37.800,00:04:39.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,You need six constraints.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:39.400,00:04:42.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,So a typical way is people fix one point.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:42.740,00:04:45.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,That eliminates three degrees of freedom.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:45.240,00:04:47.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then the second point, you say you can only move in one
Dialogue: 0,00:04:47.560,00:04:50.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,direction, so in case the structure actually expands.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:50.100,00:04:53.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,But it will still stay on the same axis.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:53.300,00:04:54.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that eliminates another two.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:54.800,00:04:56.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then another rotational one.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:56.800,00:04:59.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then the third point, you say you can only move in one
Dialogue: 0,00:04:59.300,00:04:59.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,direction.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:59.800,00:05:01.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that eliminates the six degrees of freedom.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:01.800,00:05:04.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's how you eliminate the six degrees of freedom.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:04.800,00:05:07.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or if you know that the shape on one end doesn't change,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:07.800,00:05:11.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,you can actually glue the entire surface to another surface,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:11.800,00:05:12.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,say a fixed surface.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:12.800,00:05:15.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that will, of course, be sufficient for eliminating
Dialogue: 0,00:05:15.800,00:05:18.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,the uncertainty here.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:18.800,00:05:19.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:19.300,00:05:24.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in this case, we're going to just use the fixed constraint
Dialogue: 0,00:05:24.300,00:05:25.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,on the two feet.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:25.180,00:05:26.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,Actually, I could use the drop-down feet.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:26.620,00:05:28.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you want to show that you can just, say,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:28.860,00:05:30.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,use a please plate in particular, and then
Dialogue: 0,00:05:30.440,00:05:32.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,each point may have two points, actually.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:32.320,00:05:33.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,We've just given you theHệ IQ.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:33.320,00:05:36.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,And so that's that much of dürfen excited about the
Dialogue: 0,00:05:36.200,00:05:36.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,question after all.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:36.900,00:05:37.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we think it's prettyigned.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:37.560,00:05:40.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Obviously, it's very easy to read the question form
Dialogue: 0,00:05:40.060,00:05:40.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,here.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:40.440,00:05:42.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,And it's so simple.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:42.080,00:05:44.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Instead of learning it's usuallyators that these
Dialogue: 0,00:05:44.440,00:05:46.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,ones are adding, that's what we're seeing here in the
Dialogue: 0,00:05:46.720,00:05:47.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,uni.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:47.140,00:05:48.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what I mean to say is thisíd be theしま

Dialogue: 0,00:05:49.860,00:05:51.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that means we have two dimensions.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:51.220,00:05:52.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,It includes x, y, z components and a

Dialogue: 0,00:05:54.720,00:05:55.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's how you compute it on your own.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:55.560,00:05:55.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think it's for doing.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:55.620,00:05:56.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,Bye-bye.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:56.420,00:06:02.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well, so far it's actually a two-way coupling between physics number one and two, but a
Dialogue: 0,00:06:02.240,00:06:04.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,one-way coupling between physics two and three.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:04.600,00:06:08.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what I could have done is in the study step, I can use step one to solve for physics
Dialogue: 0,00:06:08.960,00:06:13.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,one and two, and then step two to solve for physics three, use the information from step
Dialogue: 0,00:06:13.120,00:06:14.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,one.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:14.120,00:06:17.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,But in this case, the memory requirement is very minimal.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:17.280,00:06:21.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,So how am I going to do the visualization for the third physics?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:21.940,00:06:27.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,I could right-click on the surface plot of the temperature, add a deformation plot, use
Dialogue: 0,00:06:27.100,00:06:29.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,the deformation to show the XYZ component deformation.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:29.880,00:06:33.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you see what's the straight line, the initial shape, and the shady part.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:33.720,00:06:37.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,After deformation, it's actually exaggerated by 53 times.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:37.180,00:06:41.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,I can change that to one.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:41.240,00:06:45.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you have a very small gap between the initial shape and the after deformation shape.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:45.920,00:06:48.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Of course, you can exaggerate it.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:48.960,00:06:51.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any questions for the third physics?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:51.580,00:06:51.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Adding the third physics?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:51.940,00:06:55.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,So more stress and analyze the structural deformation?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:55.620,00:06:59.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,One second.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:59.000,00:07:04.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So coming back to the slice.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:04.120,00:07:08.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So so far, I hope I showed you the workflow where to find the different buttons.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:08.920,00:07:14.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mostly used the model builder because the ribbon was actually introduced later, so I'm
Dialogue: 0,00:07:14.140,00:07:16.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,more used to the older version of it.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:16.700,00:07:21.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,But hopefully so far I showed you how to solve a coupled phenomena, how to introduce the
Dialogue: 0,00:07:21.580,00:07:22.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,coupling.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:22.340,00:07:26.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,And by now you understand there's no limitation how many physics you can choose and what kind
Dialogue: 0,00:07:26.800,00:07:27.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,of coupling you can implement.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:27.800,00:07:33.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,Even for a single physics, it's a very useful or simple tool to have because you have the
Dialogue: 0,00:07:33.400,00:07:38.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,same workflow for all the physics that you also show in the UFO score.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:38.500,00:07:42.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then I mentioned that anywhere you can type in constants, you can type in all the
Dialogue: 0,00:07:42.340,00:07:46.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,other different things, numbing expressions, function calls.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:46.080,00:07:47.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,You can add user-defined equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:47.080,00:07:48.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,I haven't showed that yet.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:48.080,00:07:49.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, and parameterization.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:49.080,00:07:50.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,I want to quickly show that.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:50.080,00:07:51.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,It'll be in the next slide.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:51.080,00:07:51.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:51.580,00:07:53.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,It'll only take a minute or so.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:53.580,00:07:57.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So a lot of times people want to compare different designs.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:57.860,00:08:00.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,Actually let me disable this multi-physics node.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:00.580,00:08:08.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,It was introduced with the second set of equations I introduced.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:08.200,00:08:11.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,So my expansion, I'll disable that as well.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:11.100,00:08:12.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:12.100,00:08:16.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this was the working version of my last computation, the model.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:16.380,00:08:21.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what happens if I want to try a few different designs and see which one gives me the peak
Dialogue: 0,00:08:21.080,00:08:25.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,temperature, the highest peak temperature on one of the shoulder points?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:25.080,00:08:31.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what I'll do is in geometry, I want to use a parameter to control that distance,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:31.080,00:08:33.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,extrusion distance, so the thickness of it.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:33.760,00:08:35.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So just call it thickness.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:35.200,00:08:39.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,Of course it's going to turn red because it's not defined anywhere.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:39.720,00:08:42.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,In global definitions, I can add parameter list.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:42.580,00:08:48.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,And here I'll say thickness 0.2.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:48.080,00:08:50.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then I can go to the study.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:50.080,00:08:51.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:51.080,00:08:54.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in the study node, add a parametric sweep.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:54.200,00:08:56.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now here pops the entire list.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:56.600,00:08:58.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right now I only have one parameter.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:58.420,00:09:03.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I'll say instead of 0.2, run me three cases, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:03.720,00:09:10.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or you can use the range button right here, typing the beginning and end, what's the step.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:10.200,00:09:13.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,And now you've computed, it's essentially going to run the same problem three times
Dialogue: 0,00:09:13.640,00:09:15.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,with a different geometry.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:15.140,00:09:20.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,And every step is going to build a new geometry, build a new mesh, assemble a new system matrix,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:20.080,00:09:22.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then give me a solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:22.420,00:09:26.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,And it's going to put all the three solutions in one solution data set, as three separate
Dialogue: 0,00:09:26.700,00:09:27.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,frames.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:27.700,00:09:31.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if I want to run an animation that loops through that three frames, I could actually
Dialogue: 0,00:09:31.600,00:09:33.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,do that.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:33.180,00:09:38.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Of course in time-dependent problems, you save the solution every certain seconds, and
Dialogue: 0,00:09:38.440,00:09:41.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,then you can run the animation of that as well.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:41.400,00:09:42.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:42.580,00:09:44.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now you've finished computing.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:44.320,00:09:47.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now you see, for example, if I look at the temperature plot.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:47.200,00:09:48.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you can see that the temperature plot is now running.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:48.200,00:09:49.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now you can see that the temperature plot is running.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:49.200,00:09:50.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:50.080,00:09:57.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I could choose a different parameter and here the plot is going to update the visualization.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:57.500,00:10:01.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I said I want to look at the temperature information at the shoulder point.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:01.220,00:10:04.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let me first find out what's the coordinate of that shoulder point.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:04.640,00:10:07.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm going to add a measure under geometry.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:07.540,00:10:14.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm going to measure a point, 0.250.2.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:14.800,00:10:19.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then what I'll do is in the solution data set, so the solution we have saved so far,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:19.700,00:10:29.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm going to right click, add a cut point 3D, type in 0.250.2, and choose that parametric
Dialogue: 0,00:10:29.820,00:10:30.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:30.820,00:10:35.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to plot the information on that particular point.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:35.580,00:10:41.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'll add a derived value of point evaluation, use this data set, evaluate the temperature
Dialogue: 0,00:10:41.500,00:10:44.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,information.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:44.300,00:10:47.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now it shows me what's the thickness and what's the temperature on that particular
Dialogue: 0,00:10:47.540,00:10:48.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,point.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:48.540,00:10:49.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:49.540,00:10:51.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,So here I have a graph, shows me where the highest temperature is.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:51.600,00:10:54.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,It shows up at the point four case.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:54.060,00:10:58.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,Of course, it's only a small variance among the three cases.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:58.480,00:10:59.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what should we do?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:59.480,00:11:02.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Run a batch refinement study, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:02.220,00:11:03.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Remember?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:03.220,00:11:07.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So after then you'll be confidently saying which one actually gives me the highest temperature
Dialogue: 0,00:11:07.920,00:11:08.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,down.
