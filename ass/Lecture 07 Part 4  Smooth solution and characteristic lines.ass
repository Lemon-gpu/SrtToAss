Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:06.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's first analyze the behavior of the conservation law equation on the
Dialogue: 0,00:00:06.720,00:00:12.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,smooth region. So if you think of back over here, over this previous
Dialogue: 0,00:00:12.960,00:00:19.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,solution, we want to analyze the behavior of this equation on somewhere other than
Dialogue: 0,00:00:19.600,00:00:26.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,this discontinuity, like over this region for example, how does it behave. And if
Dialogue: 0,00:00:26.560,00:00:36.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,you take a look at the contour in space and time, let's magnify it a little bit,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:36.080,00:00:41.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,can somebody describe to me how the solution behaves? Is there something
Dialogue: 0,00:00:41.920,00:00:47.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,special you see on the spacetime plot? Yeah there is a discontinuity, let's talk
Dialogue: 0,00:00:47.820,00:00:50.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,about this later. Right now we are talking about smooth part of the
Dialogue: 0,00:00:50.380,00:00:54.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,solution, that's right. Did you see something special on the smooth part of
Dialogue: 0,00:00:54.180,00:00:56.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,the solution?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:56.520,00:00:56.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,What did you see?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:56.560,00:01:08.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,A lot of what? Dispersion? I'm just, don't interpret it yet. It's leaning
Dialogue: 0,00:01:08.140,00:01:14.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,inwards. Yeah what else, what do you see on this plot other than colors?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:14.260,00:01:19.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,A bunch of lines, right? A bunch of not just the regular lines, a bunch of
Dialogue: 0,00:01:19.840,00:01:26.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,straight lines. Does it occur to you as non-obvious
Dialogue: 0,00:01:26.520,00:01:33.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,that the contour of a function should be straight lines? If you draw an arbitrary
Dialogue: 0,00:01:33.600,00:01:39.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,function of space and time, you would expect I get curved contours. It's not
Dialogue: 0,00:01:39.960,00:01:44.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,common to see functions in two dimensions with straight lines being
Dialogue: 0,00:01:44.400,00:01:51.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,contours, right? So why do we get straight lines? I mean that's actually not the
Dialogue: 0,00:01:51.780,00:01:56.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,case when you hit discontinuity. For example, over here,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:56.520,00:02:01.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,we don't get a straight line. We get a line that actually turns, right? Two things
Dialogue: 0,00:02:01.760,00:02:07.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,hitting to each other and it turns. But on the smooth portion, you see all straight
Dialogue: 0,00:02:07.320,00:02:15.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,lines, so why do we see straight lines and what are these lines? That's a great point.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:15.660,00:02:22.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you already did the analysis I want you to do. So that analysis is from the differential
Dialogue: 0,00:02:22.240,00:02:26.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,form of the equation, right? So if you go back to the differential form of the
Dialogue: 0,00:02:26.480,00:02:37.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,equation partial u partial t plus df du times partial u partial x equal to zero okay and we
Dialogue: 0,00:02:37.440,00:02:46.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,said this is the wave speed and if f is only a function of u then df du is only a function of u
Dialogue: 0,00:02:46.880,00:02:55.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,that means the speed at which the wave propagates they are just a function of u
Dialogue: 0,00:02:56.480,00:03:04.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,so as the wave propagates at for example towards the right the because if i'm if i'm riding along
Dialogue: 0,00:03:04.520,00:03:11.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,the wave then locally the solution value u doesn't change and therefore the speed doesn't change
Dialogue: 0,00:03:11.260,00:03:20.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,intuitively that's the answer right mathematically let's do a little bit a little bit of analysis
Dialogue: 0,00:03:20.480,00:03:25.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,so so if we look at the differential equation
Dialogue: 0,00:03:25.740,00:03:26.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,okay
Dialogue: 0,00:03:26.240,00:03:26.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,okay
Dialogue: 0,00:03:26.480,00:03:35.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,what what we can do is we can write the solution u at a particular x plus
Dialogue: 0,00:03:35.740,00:03:48.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,plus or minus x plus yes x plus uh df so let's let's just do this x plus a ct so let's look at
Dialogue: 0,00:03:48.220,00:03:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,a function along the the value of the solution along a straight line
Dialogue: 0,00:03:56.480,00:04:20.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,on the xt plot
Dialogue: 0,00:04:20.640,00:04:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,only x more than on the right distance to be the slope of dx dt
Dialogue: 0,00:04:22.000,00:04:22.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,okay
Dialogue: 0,00:04:22.640,00:04:26.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,so the derivative so now because i wrote u as a function of not x plus ct so x plus ct
Dialogue: 0,00:04:26.340,00:04:29.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,x plus ct is x, and also t.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:29.640,00:04:31.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is x, this is t.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:32.780,00:04:34.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,Does it make sense what I'm doing?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:34.500,00:04:38.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm looking at a function of the solution along a line.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:38.700,00:04:42.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,So basically, if I make x a dependent variable of t,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:43.040,00:04:49.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,then I reduced u into a single-variate, univariate function instead of bivariate function.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:50.480,00:04:52.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,x plus, I think.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:52.440,00:04:59.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So basically, let me use x0 to be a distinguishing from this x.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:59.560,00:05:02.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is x0, this is t equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:02.860,00:05:07.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So as t increases, x is going to increase by c times t.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:12.180,00:05:18.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this function, if we fix x0, is just a function of t.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:18.160,00:05:22.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's look at what is du of x0 plus ct.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:22.440,00:05:24.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,t dt.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:27.800,00:05:30.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Again, we are using chain rule.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:30.320,00:05:41.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is equal to partial u, partial t times dx0 plus ct dt plus partial u.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:42.200,00:05:44.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, sorry, this is partial x, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:44.220,00:05:46.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,I am differentiating towards the first variable.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:46.840,00:05:49.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Partial u, partial t times 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:49.500,00:05:51.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is dt dt.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:52.440,00:05:53.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,And what is this?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:56.180,00:05:57.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,What is the first term?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:58.540,00:05:59.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's just c, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:59.800,00:06:06.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this whole thing is equal to c times partial u, partial x plus partial u, partial t.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:06.240,00:06:09.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, let's go back to the original differential equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:09.800,00:06:12.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,According to the original differential equation,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:12.220,00:06:16.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,this whole term is equal to 0 when c is equal to what?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:18.500,00:06:21.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,If c is equal to df du,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:22.440,00:06:24.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,this whole thing is going to be equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:25.300,00:06:27.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,So there is a chain reaction here.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:27.780,00:06:45.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if I choose c to be equal to df du at x equal to x0 and t equal to 0,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:45.720,00:06:52.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,then I know that the time derivative of u along that line is going to be 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:52.440,00:06:57.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,Which means along that line, my u is going to be constant.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:58.780,00:07:02.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,My u is going to be constant tells me that c is going to be constant.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:03.580,00:07:07.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that means I can go along straight into that line
Dialogue: 0,00:07:07.100,00:07:10.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,and expect my solution to hold constant, not changing at all.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:12.560,00:07:14.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right, does it make sense?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:14.340,00:07:18.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that is why we see a lot of straight lines on this contour.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:19.560,00:07:22.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,A contour is a line on which the value,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:22.380,00:07:24.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,the value of a solution holds constant.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:25.820,00:07:30.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,And these contours are characterized by these lines,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:30.740,00:07:33.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,x equal to x0 plus c.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:33.440,00:07:35.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, okay, so this line is,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:36.940,00:07:40.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,you can either write x equal to x0 plus ct,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:40.380,00:07:43.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,or you can write it as x minus ct equal to constant.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:45.280,00:07:47.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Either way is fine.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:48.880,00:07:51.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think maybe you are thinking about this, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:51.580,00:07:52.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:52.380,00:07:54.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,if x minus ct is a constant,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:54.380,00:07:57.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,that also represents that straight line.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:58.380,00:07:59.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right, okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:59.380,00:08:01.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now, another question is,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:01.380,00:08:04.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,how does the slope of the line depend on the local solution?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:05.880,00:08:09.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,The slope of the line is the inverse of df du, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:11.380,00:08:15.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if I have a df du locally equal to 0, for example,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:15.880,00:08:17.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,what kind of line should I get?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:17.880,00:08:19.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,I get a vertical line, exactly.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:19.380,00:08:21.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,If df du is equal to 0, c is equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:22.380,00:08:23.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,I get a vertical line.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:23.380,00:08:25.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,What if df du is negative?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:25.380,00:08:29.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,I get a line that is tilted towards your left, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:29.380,00:08:31.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,If df du is positive,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:31.380,00:08:33.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,I get a line that tilts towards your right.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:33.880,00:08:36.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,And again, let's look at the Berger's equation
Dialogue: 0,00:08:36.380,00:08:38.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,to see how does my df du depend on u.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:38.880,00:08:40.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,So Berger's equation,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:41.380,00:08:45.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,if f of u is equal to u squared over 2,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:45.880,00:08:49.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,df du is equal to u,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:49.380,00:08:50.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,then,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:50.380,00:08:51.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,u less than 0, c is equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:52.380,00:08:57.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,I get negatively sloping contours.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:57.380,00:09:00.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,u equal to 0, I get vertical contours.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:00.380,00:09:04.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,u greater than 0, I get rightward tilting contours.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:04.380,00:09:07.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's look at this to see if that's the case.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:07.380,00:09:08.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right, so,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:08.380,00:09:09.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,so,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:09.380,00:09:12.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,when u is positive, the color is u,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:12.380,00:09:14.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,I get right sloping contours.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:14.380,00:09:17.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,When u is negative, I get left sloping contours.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:18.380,00:09:20.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,And when u is almost 0,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:20.380,00:09:21.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,towards here and here,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:21.380,00:09:23.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,I get vertical contours.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:23.380,00:09:25.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the more negative I get,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:25.380,00:09:27.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,the more leftward sloping I get.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:27.380,00:09:28.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,The more positive I get,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:28.380,00:09:30.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,the more right sloping I get.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:31.380,00:09:32.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's
Dialogue: 0,00:09:32.380,00:09:35.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,the contours we call characteristic lines.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:36.380,00:09:37.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,So these are
Dialogue: 0,00:09:37.380,00:09:40.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,the characteristic lines of my solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:40.380,00:09:43.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,x equal to any x naught

Dialogue: 0,00:09:51.380,00:09:54.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,this way, the other way, I think.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:54.380,00:09:59.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,x plus df du times t
Dialogue: 0,00:09:59.380,00:10:02.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,are called

Dialogue: 0,00:10:10.380,00:10:12.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:13.380,00:10:16.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, so, when we solve
Dialogue: 0,00:10:16.380,00:10:18.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,nonlinear conservation laws using any numerical methods,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:18.380,00:10:20.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,we should expect to see these
Dialogue: 0,00:10:20.380,00:10:22.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,characteristics.
