Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:08.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,We only talked about u0 is equal to a fixed value, let's say y.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:10.720,00:00:16.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,And in this case, this boundary condition is going to appear in our right-hand side.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:16.300,00:00:30.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,And d dt of my solution u vector is equal to a matrix times u vector plus a constant term.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:31.580,00:00:39.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the constant term u0, the u0 is going to appear here as u0 over delta x squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:40.300,00:00:40.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:41.700,00:00:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And today we are going to introduce the...
Dialogue: 0,00:00:46.300,00:00:47.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,Newman boundary condition.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:47.700,00:00:54.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is called the Dirichlet boundary condition under the name of a mathematician.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:54.800,00:01:02.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we are also going to talk about Newman boundary condition, that is du dx at, let's say, x equal to 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:02.520,00:01:06.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,The right-hand side is equal to, let's say, z.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:06.720,00:01:11.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is called Newman boundary condition.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:13.340,00:01:16.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Newman boundary condition is going to affect...
Dialogue: 0,00:01:16.300,00:01:20.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,the discretization of the right-hand side.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:21.300,00:01:27.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the partial derivative of u at x equal to...
Dialogue: 0,00:01:27.300,00:01:41.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,at x, let's say, n minus 1 is going to be discretized as u of n plus u of n minus 2 minus 2u n minus 1 divided by delta x squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:41.300,00:01:42.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:42.300,00:01:43.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:43.300,00:01:44.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:44.300,00:01:45.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:45.300,00:01:46.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:46.300,00:01:47.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:47.300,00:01:56.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we already said that one way to discretize this is saying u n minus u n minus 1, a consistent
Dialogue: 0,00:01:56.300,00:02:03.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,way of discretizing this, which means delta x goes to 0, the approximation error goes to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:05.300,00:02:10.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,This can be used to approximate the derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:12.300,00:02:14.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now we know this is equal to z.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:16.300,00:02:24.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that establishes a linear relationship between u n and u n minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:25.300,00:02:42.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if we plug this into here, what we get is u n is going to disappear and become u n minus 1 plus z delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:42.300,00:02:47.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,And plus u n minus 2 minus 2 u n minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:47.300,00:02:55.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you can collect these two terms and instead of minus 2, I'm going to erase this and this
Dialogue: 0,00:02:55.700,00:02:59.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,becomes minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:59.300,00:03:00.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:00.300,00:03:05.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's one way of dealing with the Newman boundary condition, which instead of setting
Dialogue: 0,00:03:05.540,00:03:08.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,the value to something, you set the derivative to something.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:08.300,00:03:09.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's only an x equal to 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:09.300,00:03:10.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:10.300,00:03:11.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:11.300,00:03:12.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what's the x equal to 1?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:12.300,00:03:13.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,The Newman boundary.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:13.300,00:03:18.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,The Newman boundary condition, this is when I'm setting the boundary condition at the
Dialogue: 0,00:03:18.300,00:03:25.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,right, when at the last point.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:25.300,00:03:30.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,If I have a Newman boundary condition at the left, it's similar.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:30.300,00:03:35.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm going to use u 1 and u 0 as opposed to u n and u n minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:35.300,00:03:37.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:37.300,00:03:38.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:38.300,00:03:39.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you look at this.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:39.300,00:03:40.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:40.300,00:03:46.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you look at this formula, this has two effects.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:46.060,00:03:48.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,One effect is there a z term.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:48.300,00:03:49.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:49.300,00:03:56.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,So z over delta x, which is going to go to the constant term in this equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:56.020,00:03:58.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,All the others are 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:58.300,00:04:05.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,Second is that it is modifying the coefficients of u n minus 1 specifically.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:05.980,00:04:08.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,So all the rest of this scheme get minus 2 over delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:08.300,00:04:15.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Minus 2 over delta x square.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:15.300,00:04:21.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,But the last, very last one is going to get minus 1 over delta x square.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:21.060,00:04:22.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:22.920,00:04:29.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,All the other terms stay the same.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:29.060,00:04:34.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:34.500,00:04:37.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it is modifying this.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:37.060,00:04:38.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:38.060,00:04:39.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it is modifying this.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:39.060,00:04:43.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And it is also adding that.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:43.960,00:04:50.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So Newman boundary condition has the effect of both modifying the matrix and adding something
Dialogue: 0,00:04:50.060,00:04:53.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,on the right hand side.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:53.060,00:04:54.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:54.060,00:05:03.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you have a first order approximation for the boundary condition, but that costs the
Dialogue: 0,00:05:03.060,00:05:05.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,whole solution, the first order algorithm?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:05.060,00:05:06.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's a very good question.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:06.380,00:05:07.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So here I have a first order approximation.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:07.060,00:05:08.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:08.060,00:05:09.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I have a first order approximation just on one point.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:09.060,00:05:10.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:10.060,00:05:11.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,And for many equations, including this one.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:11.060,00:05:12.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the answer is equation dependent.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:12.060,00:05:13.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,For this particular equation, it will not affect the quality of the entire solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:13.060,00:05:14.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:14.060,00:05:15.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,But that's only for specific equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:15.060,00:05:16.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,You have to do analysis for different equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:16.060,00:05:35.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if you just want to be safe, you can derive a second order approximation for the boundary
Dialogue: 0,00:05:35.060,00:05:36.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,condition also.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:36.060,00:05:37.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:37.060,00:05:38.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any other questions?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:38.060,00:05:43.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So is that n by n now as opposed to n minus 1?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:43.060,00:05:52.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is still n minus 1 by n minus 1 because we get u n minus 1 and u n minus 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:52.060,00:05:54.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,An alternative way.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:54.460,00:05:56.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,So there is a lot of ways to deal with boundary conditions.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:56.720,00:06:03.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,A different way is to extend the solution all the way to u n.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:03.000,00:06:04.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if you do that.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:04.060,00:06:05.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,. .
Dialogue: 0,00:06:05.060,00:06:08.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,You should be using both.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:08.560,00:06:15.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean you can use both the differential equation and the boundary condition to derive the evolution
Dialogue: 0,00:06:15.900,00:06:17.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,of the last grid point.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:17.740,00:06:19.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,D u n d t.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:19.740,00:06:21.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:21.120,00:06:24.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you want to take that approach, we can talk about that.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:24.300,00:06:25.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:25.300,00:06:26.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:26.300,00:06:27.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,You have a question?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:27.300,00:06:28.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:28.300,00:06:29.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,So z is just now a function of time.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:29.300,00:06:30.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:30.300,00:06:33.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,Z, yeah, is just another function of time.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:33.460,00:06:34.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's right.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:34.460,00:06:34.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:35.060,00:06:36.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:36.060,00:06:37.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:37.060,00:06:47.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you use a center difference to approximate the derivative at u n, it actually changes
Dialogue: 0,00:06:47.100,00:06:52.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,things because it will involve u n plus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:52.800,00:06:57.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,And u n plus 1, there is no way you should include u n plus 1 in the solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:57.980,00:07:03.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in order to cancel u n plus 1, you also need to discretize the differential equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:03.060,00:07:04.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,. .
Dialogue: 0,00:07:04.060,00:07:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The differential equation, the heat equation at u n itself, at the right boundary.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:10.000,00:07:13.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now you have a differential equation, you have a boundary condition, both involves u

Dialogue: 0,00:07:16.140,00:07:18.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Use them to cancel it.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:18.560,00:07:23.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's how you would do it if you want to use center difference.

Dialogue: 0,00:07:46.060,00:07:47.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:47.060,00:07:53.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,. I'm also going to derive the equation for d u n d t, which is equal to u n plus

Dialogue: 0,00:07:59.640,00:08:02.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,. And I have the central difference approximation.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:02.060,00:08:07.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,over 2 delta x equal to z, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:07.780,00:08:14.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that means u n plus 1 is equal to u n minus 1 plus 2 z delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:14.580,00:08:16.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,I plug it into here.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:16.520,00:08:22.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,That will give me u n minus 1 plus 2 z delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:22.340,00:08:29.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that is replacing u n plus 1 plus u n minus 1 minus 2 u n over delta x squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:29.880,00:08:37.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we're going to see instead of combining with u n, we're combining with u n minus 1.
