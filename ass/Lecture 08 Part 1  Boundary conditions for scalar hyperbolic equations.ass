Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:02.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,And boundary condition in general is difficult.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:02.860,00:00:09.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,So today let me illustrate some of the very basic ways to handle boundary conditions
Dialogue: 0,00:00:09.360,00:00:14.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,for equations that exhibit wave-like behaviors.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:16.040,00:00:16.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:18.920,00:00:23.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,We're going to start talking about boundary conditions for scalar PDs.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:23.820,00:00:26.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the simplest type of equation we want to look at.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:26.800,00:00:33.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,And again, we are looking at the linear advecting equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:35.400,00:00:38.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,Since we started talking about conservation laws,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:39.060,00:00:45.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,this is simply an equation of a scalar conservation law with f of u, the flux, equal to what?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:46.640,00:00:48.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,What is the flux in this equation?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:48.900,00:00:52.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,If a conservation law, conservation...
Dialogue: 0,00:00:54.680,00:00:55.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oops.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:56.800,00:01:08.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,If a conservation law is written as partial u, partial t, plus partial f of u, partial x, equal to zero,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:09.040,00:01:11.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,what is the flux in this case?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:12.300,00:01:12.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:13.900,00:01:14.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Big u, lower u?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:15.200,00:01:17.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Big u times small u, right.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:17.520,00:01:19.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's a linear function of u.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:20.460,00:01:26.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,What is the characteristic speed of this equation?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:26.800,00:01:28.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,Big u?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:28.860,00:01:29.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,Hmm?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:29.300,00:01:29.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,Big u?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:30.460,00:01:31.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's just a big u.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:31.960,00:01:33.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Remember the characteristics?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:38.040,00:01:43.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,They are df d small u, which in this case is equal to big u, exactly.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:45.580,00:01:49.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if there are shocks, what is the speed of the shock?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:53.980,00:01:55.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or speed of discontinuity?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:56.800,00:02:17.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,The speed of discontinuity is equal to f on the left minus f on the right divided by u on the left minus u on the right.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:17.960,00:02:21.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or it's delta f over delta u.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:22.740,00:02:26.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,In this case, if f is a linear function of u, what is delta f over delta u?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:26.800,00:02:31.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Again, it's u, exactly.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:31.520,00:02:36.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So all the wave and all the discontinuity, everything propagates at the same speed u.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:37.180,00:02:40.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, in this case, what is the proper way of setting the boundary condition?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:42.020,00:02:43.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's consider two cases.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:45.640,00:02:52.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,First case, u, big u, greater than zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:53.340,00:02:56.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we no longer consider an infinite domain or p.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:56.800,00:02:57.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,We consider a periodic domain.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:57.580,00:03:00.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,We consider the domain between zero and l.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:00.740,00:03:01.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is x.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:02.080,00:03:02.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is u.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:03.560,00:03:06.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,Imagine I have an initial condition like that.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:08.680,00:03:10.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,What is a proper way?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:10.780,00:03:12.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let me first ask the hard question.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:12.740,00:03:17.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,What is a proper way to specify the boundary condition at l?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:20.600,00:03:21.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,At x equal to l.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:22.480,00:03:25.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,Remember when big u is equal to zero, everything continues.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:26.800,00:03:34.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the solution, discontinuous solution, the arc propagates towards the right with the positive speed.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:34.360,00:03:39.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,So can I set a derivative boundary condition at x equal to l?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:39.280,00:03:43.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's say u equal to zero, can I do that?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:43.760,00:03:45.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,No, I can't.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:45.520,00:03:53.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what are the type of proper boundary conditions I can set on x equal to l?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:53.380,00:03:55.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,Can I set a Newman boundary condition?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:55.140,00:03:55.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,Can I set the derivative boundary condition?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:55.580,00:03:56.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Can I set the derivative boundary condition?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:56.320,00:04:05.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,derivative of u at l equal to zero, for example, would it allow the waves to probably propagate
Dialogue: 0,00:04:05.960,00:04:15.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,out of the domain, maintaining the shape? No. No boundary condition can be set at x equal to l.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:15.380,00:04:24.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is something I want to emphasize, is you should not set any boundary conditions.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:24.480,00:04:35.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,So no boundary condition at x equal to l. Okay. At x equal to zero, on the other hand,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:36.120,00:04:41.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,you can set Dirichlet boundary condition, you can set Newman boundary condition, you can do
Dialogue: 0,00:04:41.140,00:04:49.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,a lot of things, you have a lot of flexibility at x equal to zero, right? So at x equal to zero,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:49.320,00:04:53.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,you are free to choose
Dialogue: 0,00:04:53.560,00:04:54.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,a
Dialogue: 0,00:04:54.480,00:04:59.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,boundary condition. Your boundary condition, bc is boundary condition. All right. And the
Dialogue: 0,00:04:59.240,00:05:07.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,second case, you should be able to use the same logic, is u less than zero, what is the
Dialogue: 0,00:05:07.480,00:05:14.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,proper boundary condition at x equal to zero? In this case, the wave propagates towards
Dialogue: 0,00:05:14.160,00:05:20.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,left, right? So what is the proper boundary condition for the, at the boundary where the
Dialogue: 0,00:05:20.880,00:05:24.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,wave is coming out of the domain?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:24.480,00:05:29.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,No boundary condition. No boundary condition, right. So there shouldn't be any boundary
Dialogue: 0,00:05:29.240,00:05:35.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,condition if the waves are going out of the domain over here, because information goes
Dialogue: 0,00:05:35.740,00:05:40.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,from inside the domain to outside the domain. There shouldn't be any information coming
Dialogue: 0,00:05:40.300,00:05:48.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,from outside the domain. And the boundary condition is supplementary, it's basically
Dialogue: 0,00:05:48.360,00:05:52.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,information coming from the boundary, from outside the boundary. That's what boundary
Dialogue: 0,00:05:52.500,00:05:54.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,condition gives you.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:54.480,00:06:03.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,It gives you information from outside the boundary. So here, at x equal to L, we are
Dialogue: 0,00:06:03.860,00:06:14.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,free to choose boundary condition. So these are a scalar conservation law, a scalar and
Dialogue: 0,00:06:14.460,00:06:19.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,linear vector equation. So we can generalize, of course. I won't write it down here, but
Dialogue: 0,00:06:19.820,00:06:20.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,like we can generalize. For a nonlinear PDE, if we have a characteristic of x equal to
Dialogue: 0,00:06:20.380,00:06:24.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,zero, then we can generalize. We can generalize. For a nonlinear PDE, if we have a characteristic
Dialogue: 0,00:06:24.280,00:06:33.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,that are not a constant U. How does the bounded condition work? It works the
Dialogue: 0,00:06:33.600,00:06:39.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,similar way. It just depends on locally is the characteristics going towards
Dialogue: 0,00:06:39.640,00:06:49.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,outside the domain or it is coming into the domain. Okay so in that case if you
Dialogue: 0,00:06:49.220,00:06:56.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,code up a solver which you will do to solve a nonlinear scalar
Dialogue: 0,00:06:56.380,00:06:59.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,conservation equation, I mean nonlinear scalar conservation law,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:59.800,00:07:06.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,the proper boundary condition to set at the boundary may be time dependent.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:06.120,00:07:12.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you have to adapt your bounded condition, actually adapt whether
Dialogue: 0,00:07:12.680,00:07:19.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,you should set a boundary condition or not depending on the solution U at the
Dialogue: 0,00:07:19.200,00:07:24.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,boundary. If the solution U at the boundary at that moment turns out to be
Dialogue: 0,00:07:24.860,00:07:29.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,allowing the characteristics to go into the domain that is when you should set a
Dialogue: 0,00:07:29.280,00:07:34.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,bounded condition. When the solution U is such that when you evaluate the F of that
Dialogue: 0,00:07:34.700,00:07:39.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,U, you find the solution to be going, you find the characteristics to be going out
Dialogue: 0,00:07:39.000,00:07:43.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,of the domain, then you know this is not the right time to set a bounded
Dialogue: 0,00:07:43.460,00:07:48.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,condition. The bounded condition, what we mean by bounded condition is you're
Dialogue: 0,00:07:48.260,00:07:49.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,setting the values
Dialogue: 0,00:07:49.180,00:07:56.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,at a particular spatial location for a range of time. Here you need to, for
Dialogue: 0,00:07:56.500,00:08:00.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,example, if you set a Dirichlet bounded condition, you need to set the
Dialogue: 0,00:08:00.400,00:08:06.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,value of U at x equals 0 for a range of t. The bounded condition you should give
Dialogue: 0,00:08:06.340,00:08:11.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,is a function of t only. For example you can set it with a constant 0 is a
Dialogue: 0,00:08:11.680,00:08:16.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,perfectly fine function of t or you can set it to be linearly increasing as a
Dialogue: 0,00:08:16.620,00:08:18.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,function of t either way. For example if you set a function of t as a function of t,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:18.240,00:08:23.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,for example if you set this to be equal to 0, you would see the wave going towards the
Dialogue: 0,00:08:23.560,00:08:29.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,right and whatever is left over, so you see the same shape adverting towards the
Dialogue: 0,00:08:29.800,00:08:39.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,right and the range becomes 0 once the wave shifts away from x equal to 0. What
Dialogue: 0,00:08:39.660,00:08:46.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,if you set this to be a function of t? What if you set it to be equal to just t,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:46.120,00:08:47.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,for example?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:47.300,00:08:52.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,The value increases as time increases and you're gonna see a wave that is not
Dialogue: 0,00:08:52.980,00:08:56.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,0 but you're gonna see the same wave going towards the right but on the left
Dialogue: 0,00:08:56.420,00:09:04.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,side, it'll be that... because the value here... here is from the
Dialogue: 0,00:09:04.600,00:09:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,bounded condition at an earlier time. Here is from the bounded condition at a later
Dialogue: 0,00:09:08.000,00:09:12.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,time and here is from the bounded condition even at a later time. How do you do
Dialogue: 0,00:09:12.740,00:09:16.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,stability analysis when the domain is not periodic? So first of all you need to
Dialogue: 0,00:09:16.500,00:09:20.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,make sure the discretization if you don't have any boundary condition if it
Dialogue: 0,00:09:20.040,00:09:24.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,is periodic it is stable once you have the boundary condition you can do when
Dialogue: 0,00:09:24.260,00:09:28.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,human stability analysis anymore you need to look at the matrix again so you
Dialogue: 0,00:09:28.260,00:09:35.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,need to form the matrix and look at whether the matrix has any eigenvalues
Dialogue: 0,00:09:35.500,00:09:41.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,or that let so I'm just going to slightly touch what you have to do if
Dialogue: 0,00:09:41.520,00:09:49.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,you have multiple dimensions okay a multiple dimensions you have a domain so
Dialogue: 0,00:09:49.740,00:09:56.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,let's say this is Omega and you have when you do characteristic speed
Dialogue: 0,00:09:56.040,00:10:01.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,analysis for example if you have partial u partial u partial T plus this case you
Dialogue: 0,00:10:01.920,00:10:08.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,has to be a vector right or let me just write it clearly big UX partial u
Dialogue: 0,00:10:08.240,00:10:11.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,partial X plus big u y partial u partial
Dialogue: 0,00:10:11.160,00:10:11.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,y partial u partial t and then you can write this as a vector so you can write
Dialogue: 0,00:10:11.500,00:10:12.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,this as a vector so you can write this as a vector so you can write this as a vector
Dialogue: 0,00:10:12.500,00:10:19.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,if you write this big u vector equal to ux u y then the same equation can be
Dialogue: 0,00:10:19.260,00:10:27.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,written as partial u partial t plus u vector dot with the gradient of u equal
Dialogue: 0,00:10:27.140,00:10:37.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,to 0 right and in this case the flux is a vector is equal to the ux u and u y of
Dialogue: 0,00:10:37.300,00:10:41.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,u which is equal to this big u times small u
Dialogue: 0,00:10:41.140,00:10:47.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,this is my flux and of course you can still analyze the characteristics the
Dialogue: 0,00:10:47.700,00:10:54.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,characteristics is partial f partial u which in this case is this vector big u
Dialogue: 0,00:10:54.780,00:11:03.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,now you have a vector big you that goes that has a that you can draw on the
Dialogue: 0,00:11:03.640,00:11:08.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,boundary and in this case it's again it's very clear which part of the
Dialogue: 0,00:11:08.740,00:11:10.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,boundary
Dialogue: 0,00:11:10.780,00:11:16.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,is appropriate for specifying boundary condition can tell me in this case which
Dialogue: 0,00:11:16.640,00:11:21.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,part of the boundary is appropriate for specifying boundary condition yes the
Dialogue: 0,00:11:21.480,00:11:26.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,part where the velocity goes into the domain so I can specify boundary
Dialogue: 0,00:11:26.620,00:11:35.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,condition over here here maybe not and over here so this is the range where it
Dialogue: 0,00:11:35.780,00:11:40.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,is appropriate to specify the boundary condition and the rest of the boundary no
Dialogue: 0,00:11:40.660,00:11:45.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,boundary conditions all right any questions this is the scalar equation
Dialogue: 0,00:11:45.440,00:11:51.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,case which generalizes to the system of equation case
