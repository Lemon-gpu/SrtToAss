Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:05.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to show the Comfort Workflow via an example called a titanium
Dialogue: 0,00:00:05.520,00:00:09.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,micro resistor actuator. This is not a blue flow related problem but it could
Dialogue: 0,00:00:09.840,00:00:17.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,be. So imagine a bridge shaped beam that has two feet and then a bend. So basically
Dialogue: 0,00:00:17.040,00:00:21.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,you apply it's a conductive material titanium. So when you apply a potential
Dialogue: 0,00:00:21.400,00:00:25.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,bias across the two feet you're going to have current flow through it. And then
Dialogue: 0,00:00:25.740,00:00:29.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,because of the current flowing then you're going to have resistive heating.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:29.220,00:00:33.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the dual heating is going to generate heat and the entire structure is going to heat up.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:33.060,00:00:37.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So there is going to be a temperature gradient in the structure. Because there
Dialogue: 0,00:00:37.080,00:00:40.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,is temperature gradient then it causes thermal stress. So this entire structure is
Dialogue: 0,00:00:40.920,00:00:46.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,actually going to deform because of all that. So the problem definition here we
Dialogue: 0,00:00:46.980,00:00:53.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,have the first physics which is the electric current simulation DC current
Dialogue: 0,00:00:53.220,00:00:58.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,through conductive medium. And the second physics is the thermal conduction with
Dialogue: 0,00:00:58.560,00:00:59.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,a dual heating element.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:59.220,00:01:02.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the thermal conduction is going to be the heat source. So it's a purely conductive problem.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:02.700,00:01:08.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the boundary condition we'll be setting will be will glue the two feet on a huge heat sink.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:08.100,00:01:14.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the temperature remains unchanged to 93.15. And then for the rest of the surfaces we'll assume
Dialogue: 0,00:01:14.940,00:01:18.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,they are adjacent to dry air so they actually subjected to conductive cooling.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:18.780,00:01:23.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then the third physics is a solid mechanics problem with the thermal stress.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:23.640,00:01:28.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,So to make the problem more interesting you can introduce the reverse coupling.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:29.220,00:01:37.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,You can easily say through the temperature dependent material properties the electric conductivity is the function of the local temperature.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:37.080,00:01:40.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright so I'm going to start COMSOL.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:40.440,00:01:45.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,Here it is.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:45.720,00:01:48.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I'm going to start a new model.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:48.040,00:01:55.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the two options you have on this first interface is you can either start with a blank model or start with a model wizard.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:55.000,00:01:58.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the model wizard is basically the first of few steps of the
Dialogue: 0,00:01:59.220,00:02:01.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,in your model workspace.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:01.380,00:02:03.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I select the Model Wizard, and now it
Dialogue: 0,00:02:03.840,00:02:05.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,asks me to select what's the space dimension
Dialogue: 0,00:02:05.840,00:02:07.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,I want to work with.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:07.040,00:02:09.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,So of course, in a more theoretical class,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:09.780,00:02:12.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,you would always start with a more simple situation,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:12.260,00:02:14.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,like a 0D or 1D problem.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:14.840,00:02:16.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,0D, you don't have to create a geometry.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:16.500,00:02:19.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,1D, you just draw a line with a certain length.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:19.220,00:02:22.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then the other options would be the 1D and 2D axis
Dialogue: 0,00:02:22.360,00:02:22.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,symmetric.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:22.920,00:02:25.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,So 1D axis symmetric is essentially
Dialogue: 0,00:02:25.220,00:02:28.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,equivalent to a 2D circle surface.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:28.580,00:02:30.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then the 2D axis symmetric is
Dialogue: 0,00:02:30.280,00:02:33.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,equivalent to a 3D rotation symmetry way.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:33.940,00:02:36.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,Both the physics plus the load and the boundary conditions
Dialogue: 0,00:02:36.580,00:02:39.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,have to be, plus material properties,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:39.020,00:02:42.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,have to be axis symmetric in order to qualify for that.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:42.700,00:02:45.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then there is also the 2D and 3D options.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:45.740,00:02:47.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,So right now, I'm going to choose a 3D.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:47.820,00:02:49.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's a 3D actual beam.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:49.740,00:02:51.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then I'm going to choose the first physics
Dialogue: 0,00:02:51.760,00:02:54.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,I want to solve for, which is the electric currents, right
Dialogue: 0,00:02:54.160,00:02:55.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,under the ACDC folder.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:55.760,00:02:58.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,So here, the physics are grouped not by modules,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:58.580,00:03:00.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,but by application areas.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:00.880,00:03:02.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to choose Add.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:02.480,00:03:05.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,There is a little specification on what is the interface
Dialogue: 0,00:03:05.900,00:03:07.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,and what it does.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:07.080,00:03:10.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's going to solve for a capital case V, the electric
Dialogue: 0,00:03:10.780,00:03:11.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,potential.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:11.660,00:03:13.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I can move to the study node.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:13.880,00:03:17.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,In this case, I'll choose the simplest, the stationary,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:17.540,00:03:19.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,as the solver type.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:19.280,00:03:21.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Click on Done.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:21.300,00:03:23.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now the model, we are finished its task.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:23.360,00:03:26.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now you're in the main console graphical user interface.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:26.700,00:03:27.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,We call this the GUI.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:28.580,00:03:31.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in the GUI, you see I'm using a Windows system.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:31.460,00:03:33.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the screen now gets divided into a few parts.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:33.540,00:03:35.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you use a Mac or a Linux, you'll
Dialogue: 0,00:03:35.900,00:03:40.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,see a slightly variant of this interface.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:40.140,00:03:42.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,Instead of this console ribbon, we
Dialogue: 0,00:03:42.220,00:03:44.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,call the console ribbon and tabs on the very top,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:44.520,00:03:47.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,you would have a console toolbar, so a slightly condensed
Dialogue: 0,00:03:47.280,00:03:48.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,version of it.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:48.640,00:03:51.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then basically, on the ribbon,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:51.780,00:03:54.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,you have the different tabs that goes from definition
Dialogue: 0,00:03:54.580,00:03:57.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,to geometry to material, physics, mesh, study,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:57.880,00:03:58.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,and results.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:58.380,00:04:00.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's the workflow I'm talking about from left
Dialogue: 0,00:04:00.380,00:04:01.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,to right.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:01.480,00:04:02.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the same thing here.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:02.380,00:04:04.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,In the model builder, you have an inverted tree structure
Dialogue: 0,00:04:04.940,00:04:07.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,with a root on the top and branches and nodes after it.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:07.760,00:04:11.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,There are a few options because we dictated that during the
Dialogue: 0,00:04:11.140,00:04:12.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,model wizard step.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:12.540,00:04:14.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,But essentially, you go from top to bottom of this tree.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:14.860,00:04:18.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,You will go from definition, geometry, material, physics,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:18.060,00:04:19.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,mesh, study, to results.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:19.500,00:04:22.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's the workflow, too, from top to bottom of the tree.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:22.840,00:04:24.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,You can change the sequence in any part of the model.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:24.900,00:04:27.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's just a general guideline that once you
Dialogue: 0,00:04:27.820,00:04:29.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,have all the steps aligned, you'll
Dialogue: 0,00:04:29.320,00:04:31.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,eventually have the results.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:31.380,00:04:33.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So all the options here are either
Dialogue: 0,00:04:33.860,00:04:35.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,through the buttons on the ribbon
Dialogue: 0,00:04:35.480,00:04:38.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,or through the right clicks on the model builder tree.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:38.680,00:04:40.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,So all the options are through the right click.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:40.520,00:04:43.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So when you're in doubt, right click.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:43.240,00:04:45.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,And in the middle, we have a settings window.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:45.040,00:04:47.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,So when you click on a certain node in the model builder tree,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:47.820,00:04:49.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,you have the corresponding settings for it.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:49.780,00:04:51.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then in the right, we have a graphics window
Dialogue: 0,00:04:51.700,00:04:52.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,with many buttons.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:52.480,00:04:55.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now it's a 3D geometry, so it shows the 3D coordinate.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:55.640,00:04:57.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,And in the very bottom, we have messages, progress,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:57.820,00:04:59.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,and log.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:59.820,00:05:01.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in this case, we're going to start
Dialogue: 0,00:05:01.360,00:05:03.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,with building the geometry in console.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:03.200,00:05:06.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to start with a work plane.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:06.840,00:05:08.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So work plane is right here.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:08.840,00:05:11.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,You see there are some 3D primitives.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:11.700,00:05:15.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if you import, there is some CAD-defeaturing tools.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:15.800,00:05:18.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,And there is also the, I want to emphasize,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:18.140,00:05:19.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,the virtual operations.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:19.460,00:05:21.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,For those of you who have complicated CAD geometries,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:21.840,00:05:24.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,those would come in very handy.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:24.060,00:05:26.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then after I created a work plane,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:26.220,00:05:29.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,I essentially added a work plane step
Dialogue: 0,00:05:29.280,00:05:31.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,under my geometry sequence.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:31.200,00:05:34.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,And under that work plane 1, now you
Dialogue: 0,00:05:34.180,00:05:35.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,might see the settings of work plane 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:35.780,00:05:37.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So horizontal plane, which I actually
Dialogue: 0,00:05:37.460,00:05:41.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,want to change it to a vertical plane, so xz plane.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:41.380,00:05:44.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,So under work plane 1, I have a plane geometry.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:44.280,00:05:47.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,When I click on it, I go into the 2D workspace.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:47.120,00:05:50.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,I could use the draw line operation
Dialogue: 0,00:05:50.200,00:05:52.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,to sketch the profile of the beam very quickly.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:52.680,00:05:58.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I do a series of left clicks and then a right click.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:58.360,00:06:00.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,It forms an enclosed surface.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:00.980,00:06:03.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,You could change that surface into a closed curve or open
Dialogue: 0,00:06:03.600,00:06:05.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,curve as well.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:05.220,00:06:07.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,And you see that each of the points
Dialogue: 0,00:06:07.400,00:06:08.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,that I click on, the coordinates,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:08.600,00:06:10.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,are documented as a Bezel polygon
Dialogue: 0,00:06:10.920,00:06:12.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,in the geometry sequence.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:12.080,00:06:14.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,So everything you do is documented in that model
Dialogue: 0,00:06:14.900,00:06:16.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,builder tree.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:16.040,00:06:19.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,And you can change those coordinates if you need to.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:19.280,00:06:21.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is actually a microbeam.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:21.600,00:06:22.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to go back to the geometry.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:22.680,00:06:24.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I'm going to go back to the geometry node.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:24.840,00:06:28.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Before I forget, change the default length unit
Dialogue: 0,00:06:28.440,00:06:30.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,from meter to micrometer.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:30.360,00:06:33.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now I don't have to type the e to the minus 6.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:33.360,00:06:34.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now I have a 2D geometry.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:34.920,00:06:38.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,I can right click on work plane 1, add an extrude.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:38.860,00:06:42.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I'm going to extrude it for about 0.2 micron.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:42.920,00:06:45.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,That should be good.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:45.240,00:06:50.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now I have a 3D geometry with a 0.2 micron as the thickness.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:50.440,00:06:52.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now that's the geometry step.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:52.440,00:06:53.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm going to go back to the geometry node
Dialogue: 0,00:06:53.980,00:06:56.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,and move to the next one, which is the materials node.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:56.400,00:07:00.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,I can right click, choose the first one, add material.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:00.680,00:07:04.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,And it's going to browse to the console material library.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:04.440,00:07:05.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm going to choose the building.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:05.680,00:07:07.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,The building folder actually comes with the base package.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:07.680,00:07:09.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you always have it.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:09.200,00:07:11.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,I can right click on the titanium materials,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:11.520,00:07:17.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,add it to component 1, and close the add material panel here.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:17.000,00:07:19.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now titanium is added to my material list.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:19.800,00:07:22.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,And automatically, it assigns the properties
Dialogue: 0,00:07:22.440,00:07:22.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,that I have.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:22.940,00:07:25.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,The first material I pick will be assigned to all the domains.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:25.980,00:07:28.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,So right now, there is only one domain.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:28.220,00:07:30.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And now it's going to use two of the properties.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:30.760,00:07:33.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,So those properties are what the physics calls for.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:33.600,00:07:35.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that's because in the physics,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:35.920,00:07:37.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's assigned to domain number 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:37.980,00:07:40.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the material property says from material.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:40.040,00:07:42.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's how the geometry node, the material node,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:42.720,00:07:45.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the physics node all tie together.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:45.000,00:07:47.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,If the material pick actually doesn't have that information
Dialogue: 0,00:07:47.920,00:07:50.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,necessary, you're going to get a stop sign right here.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:50.720,00:07:52.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,And when it goes through the solver,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:52.180,00:07:54.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's going to give you an error message saying,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:54.180,00:07:58.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,mat.epsn is missing, or something similar to that.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:58.680,00:08:01.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,So always check the material property.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:01.700,00:08:04.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then the next node is the physics node.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:04.120,00:08:08.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So as I said, you always follow the same workflow,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:08.060,00:08:09.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,no matter what kind of physics you work with.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:09.860,00:08:13.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you'll see that essentially, the first physics I added
Dialogue: 0,00:08:13.620,00:08:15.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,has three default nodes.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:15.080,00:08:17.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,You can tell they are the default from the uppercase D
Dialogue: 0,00:08:17.780,00:08:19.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,on the icon.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:19.640,00:08:21.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the default governing equation,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:22.180,00:08:24.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,you can tell from the shape of the icon, which
Dialogue: 0,00:08:24.220,00:08:25.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,is a field cylinder.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:25.240,00:08:27.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,That means it's on the domain level.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:27.800,00:08:30.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you see the equations very quickly here,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:30.280,00:08:34.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,that is the Laplacian type of equation we want to solve for.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:34.840,00:08:37.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that applies to everywhere in the domain.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:37.600,00:08:39.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you right click on electric currents,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:39.260,00:08:41.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,you see the other options here.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:41.140,00:08:43.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's other than the current conservation,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:43.000,00:08:47.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,you also have terminals, the domain, force calculation,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:47.940,00:08:50.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then a list of boundary conditions.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:50.880,00:08:52.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,So right now, the default boundary
Dialogue: 0,00:08:52.180,00:08:54.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,conditions is electrically insulated everywhere.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:54.900,00:08:57.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So no current goes in or out.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:57.460,00:08:59.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,And dot j equals to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:59.440,00:09:01.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the initial value, essentially
Dialogue: 0,00:09:01.160,00:09:04.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,in a stationary problem, that's the initial gas that
Dialogue: 0,00:09:04.180,00:09:06.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,is 0 potential everywhere.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:06.160,00:09:08.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we're happy with comparing these equations
Dialogue: 0,00:09:08.780,00:09:11.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,with the equations we wrote down on the slide.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:11.940,00:09:13.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,We're happy with the governing equations,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:13.480,00:09:16.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,but we do need to replace some of the boundary conditions.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:16.100,00:09:18.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I can do that by right clicking
Dialogue: 0,00:09:18.080,00:09:21.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,the electric current physics, add a ground condition.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:21.460,00:09:24.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,And now I can choose that boundary I want to work with.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:24.460,00:09:27.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the graphics window in COMSOL works with a three button
Dialogue: 0,00:09:27.140,00:09:27.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,mouse.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:27.640,00:09:31.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,You can left click, rotate the view, right click,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:31.800,00:09:34.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,handle the view, click on the center scroll wheel
Dialogue: 0,00:09:34.500,00:09:38.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,as if it's a button, move up and down, it'll zoom in or out.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:38.260,00:09:39.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So with the combination of that, you
Dialogue: 0,00:09:39.640,00:09:42.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,can very easily navigate to any part of the geometry.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:42.380,00:09:44.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,And you can always go back to the default view
Dialogue: 0,00:09:44.220,00:09:47.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,with those default buttons here.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:47.360,00:09:48.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in this case, the ground is going
Dialogue: 0,00:09:48.820,00:09:50.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,to be applied to one of the feet.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:50.560,00:09:51.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to rotate.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:51.300,00:09:55.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,And basically expose the foot.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:55.140,00:09:58.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then hover my mouse over, do a single click.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:58.120,00:10:00.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now boundary number one is being selected
Dialogue: 0,00:10:00.680,00:10:03.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,to satisfy the ground condition.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:03.540,00:10:05.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,If there is actually a very complicated geometry
Dialogue: 0,00:10:05.900,00:10:08.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,that some surfaces are hidden inside the domain,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:08.900,00:10:13.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,you could use the transparency option or the wire rendering
Dialogue: 0,00:10:13.000,00:10:14.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,to have the different visualization.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:14.840,00:10:16.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,And you can hover your mouse over and then
Dialogue: 0,00:10:16.880,00:10:18.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,use the center scroll wheel to rotate
Dialogue: 0,00:10:18.740,00:10:21.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,through the different surfaces, the different layers
Dialogue: 0,00:10:21.040,00:10:23.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,of the geometry to get to the inside layers.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:23.800,00:10:27.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,So again, that makes the selection easy.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:27.160,00:10:29.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,You can also, in the definitions,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:29.720,00:10:31.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,define some selection lists.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:31.280,00:10:35.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,Like everything within this certain ball shape
Dialogue: 0,00:10:35.420,00:10:36.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,belongs to one group, and they'll
Dialogue: 0,00:10:36.940,00:10:39.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,satisfy the same condition through the model,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:39.720,00:10:43.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,through the entire model, something like that.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:43.060,00:10:44.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,The other condition I need to change
Dialogue: 0,00:10:44.540,00:10:47.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,is the electric potential condition on the other foot.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:47.980,00:10:49.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that's going to be 0.2.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:49.040,00:10:50.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,And now you can see that the other foot is going to be 0.2.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:50.160,00:10:50.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,And now you can see that the other foot is going to be 0.2.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:50.820,00:10:53.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, if I go back to electrical insulation,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:53.160,00:10:55.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,surface number 1 and 10 are both overridden.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:55.560,00:10:58.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,So they no longer satisfy that n dot j equals to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:58.380,00:11:02.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,Instead, they satisfy the one with the red triangles that
Dialogue: 0,00:11:02.520,00:11:05.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,basically tells you what's the correspondence
Dialogue: 0,00:11:05.100,00:11:08.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,communications between the different nodes.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:08.260,00:11:09.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right, so that's it for the physics.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:09.840,00:11:12.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any questions for the physics?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:12.940,00:11:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Could you say more about the red triangle
Dialogue: 0,00:11:16.000,00:11:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and how it's about to reach there?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:18.000,00:11:20.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, so when you click on electrical insulation,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:20.520,00:11:22.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,the ground and electric potential
Dialogue: 0,00:11:22.200,00:11:24.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,has the upward red triangle, meaning
Dialogue: 0,00:11:24.700,00:11:28.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,that this condition gets later on overridden by the other two
Dialogue: 0,00:11:28.080,00:11:29.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,conditions.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:29.080,00:11:30.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,When you click on the ground, it says
Dialogue: 0,00:11:30.900,00:11:33.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,that the electrical insulation has actually

Dialogue: 0,00:11:35.940,00:11:38.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,on the same boundaries, and it's overridden by the ground.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:38.580,00:11:41.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it means those two nodes are actually
Dialogue: 0,00:11:41.640,00:11:44.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,defined on the same space, and which one dominates which one.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:44.820,00:11:48.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in terms of a lot of places, the sequence does not matter.

Dialogue: 0,00:12:00.920,00:12:03.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,But the sequence of the boundary conditions do matter,

Dialogue: 0,00:12:05.740,00:12:07.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then the later defined conditions

Dialogue: 0,00:12:17.860,00:12:19.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,and some conditions are not coexisting.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:19.840,00:12:19.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what's the difference?
Dialogue: 0,00:12:19.920,00:12:23.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the later defined ones will be the one effective.
