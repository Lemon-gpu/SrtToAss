Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:09.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's also, because you asked this question,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:09.540,00:00:16.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,let's actually figure out what is the basis functions
Dialogue: 0,00:00:16.360,00:00:25.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,for piecewise linear continuous space, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:25.720,00:00:29.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's figure out how can we choose these basis functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:30.000,00:00:42.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's imagine we have a space of simply four intervals going from 0 to 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:43.760,00:00:47.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,We have x1, x2, x3 here.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:51.240,00:00:54.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's say this is 0, this is 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:56.120,00:00:59.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,And one of the simplicities of finite expression
Dialogue: 0,00:00:59.980,00:01:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,is that it's not just a function of x1 and x2.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:00.000,00:01:02.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,The ultimate element comes from the fact that
Dialogue: 0,00:01:02.400,00:01:05.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,we can choose basis functions that are local.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:07.060,00:01:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,By local, I mean a function that is 0 in most part of the domain.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:17.060,00:01:23.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for example, what kind of function can we choose
Dialogue: 0,00:01:23.620,00:01:27.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,so that the first basis function,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:27.380,00:01:28.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,let's just try to get the basis function,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:28.880,00:01:29.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,can I choose a function that is 0 in most part of the domain?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:29.980,00:01:32.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's say we have a function that is only non-zero
Dialogue: 0,00:01:32.220,00:01:34.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,within the first element, within the first interval.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:37.060,00:01:39.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,How can we construct a function that is piecewise linear
Dialogue: 0,00:01:39.920,00:01:42.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,and continuous and only non-zero in the first interval?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:43.680,00:01:51.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,Just go from 1 back to 0 and stay 0 for the rest of the domain.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:51.580,00:01:52.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,Exactly.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:52.140,00:01:56.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's a very good idea of constructing a function
Dialogue: 0,00:01:56.200,00:01:57.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,that is local, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:57.220,00:01:59.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's keep this as our first element.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:59.420,00:02:02.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's keep this as our first function in our basis.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:02.180,00:02:02.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:02.820,00:02:06.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,Can we construct a function that is only non-zero in the second element?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:06.600,00:02:07.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,Most times.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:07.660,00:02:09.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because it has to be continuous on both sides.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:09.740,00:02:13.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,If a function is 0 at x1 and 0 at x2,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:13.160,00:02:16.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,then it has to be 0 within the whole interval, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:16.060,00:02:20.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we can't construct a function that is only non-zero in the second element.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:20.500,00:02:23.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,But can we construct something that is different from the first one
Dialogue: 0,00:02:23.920,00:02:26.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,but only non-zero in the first two elements?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:29.420,00:02:30.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,How do we do that?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:30.660,00:02:32.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,Huh?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:32.160,00:02:35.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,What?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:35.660,00:02:38.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,A head function, right.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:38.180,00:02:41.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the head function, I think what you are referring to
Dialogue: 0,00:02:41.380,00:02:44.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,is a function that starts over 0 here,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:44.260,00:02:47.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,it gets to 1 at the grid point x1,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:47.660,00:02:50.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,and go back to 0 at x2.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:50.460,00:02:54.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then it also stays 0 for the rest of the domain, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:54.660,00:02:57.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,Similarly, we can construct other heads, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:57.660,00:02:58.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:58.100,00:02:58.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:58.540,00:02:59.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:59.040,00:02:59.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:59.420,00:03:00.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have two head functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:00.540,00:03:05.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Function that stays 0 in the first element goes to 1 here,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:05.000,00:03:08.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,goes back to 0 here.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:08.180,00:03:13.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Similarly, we can construct another head function that stays 0 here and do this.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:13.960,00:03:17.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the boundaries are actually a special case
Dialogue: 0,00:03:17.580,00:03:26.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,because it's a head function where the other half of the head is outside the domain, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:26.440,00:03:28.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's kind of a one-sided head function.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:28.580,00:03:29.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, in this case,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:29.240,00:03:35.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 basis functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:35.000,00:03:36.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the question is,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:36.360,00:03:45.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,can these five basis functions represent any continuous and piecewise linear function?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:45.660,00:03:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Where the pieces are these four elements over here?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:50.000,00:03:57.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or if I have an arbitrary function that is piecewise linear, okay,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:57.000,00:03:59.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,can I represent this gray function?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:59.080,00:04:04.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Using a linear combination of these five basis functions we constructed.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:04.840,00:04:08.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if so, how do we do that?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:08.220,00:04:10.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,If no, can you construct a count example?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:10.840,00:04:15.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this, I have a gray function f of x.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:15.440,00:04:21.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,The question I was asking is, how do you represent f of f as a linear combination of
Dialogue: 0,00:04:21.640,00:04:27.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,phi 1 of x, phi 2 of x, phi 3 of x, phi 4 of x, phi 5 of x, phi 6 of x, phi 7 of x, phi
Dialogue: 0,00:04:27.920,00:04:28.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,1 of x, phi 8 of x.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:28.700,00:04:29.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,How do you do that?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:29.700,00:04:42.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the gray function would be what times phi 1 of x plus what times phi 2 of x.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:42.700,00:04:51.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's say if you know the exact form of f of x, how do you figure out the linear combination
Dialogue: 0,00:04:51.980,00:04:52.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,coefficients?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:52.980,00:04:55.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the basis function times phi 1 of f is f of x.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:55.840,00:04:57.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the basis function times phi 1 of f is f of x.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:57.840,00:04:58.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the basis function times phi 2 of x is f of x.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:58.700,00:04:59.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the basis function times phi 2 of x is f of x.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:59.700,00:05:00.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the basis function times phi 1 of f is f of x.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:00.700,00:05:01.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if we do this, the nodes, that's the node ?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:01.700,00:05:02.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:02.700,00:05:06.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,The basis functions are one at each node, exactly.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:06.420,00:05:08.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So phi 1 is equal to one.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:08.760,00:05:11.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well, let me name them differently.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:11.280,00:05:19.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let me name them as phi 0, phi 1, phi 2, phi 3, and phi 4 so that the place they are equal
Dialogue: 0,00:05:19.640,00:05:22.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,to one coincides with the numbering of the group points.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:22.700,00:05:23.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:23.700,00:05:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if we do this, can you help figure out what are the linear combination coefficients?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:28.000,00:05:28.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:28.700,00:05:30.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,f of 0, f of 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:31.660,00:05:35.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the first linear combination coefficient is f of what?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:36.600,00:05:37.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,0.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:37.480,00:05:38.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,f of 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:38.560,00:05:38.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:39.080,00:05:39.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,The second one?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:40.860,00:05:41.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, this is 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:41.920,00:05:42.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:42.140,00:05:42.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:46.260,00:05:46.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:46.840,00:05:48.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the first one is f of 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:49.260,00:05:51.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the second linear combination coefficient?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:52.140,00:05:52.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,f of 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:53.640,00:05:56.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,f of x1, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:56.740,00:05:59.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,The value of x at x1.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:00.580,00:06:10.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you multiply f0 with phi 0 of x, because phi 0 at x equal to 0 is equal to 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:10.340,00:06:23.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you multiply this, the Green function is going to be scaled to a value that is equal to f0 at x equal to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:24.120,00:06:26.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the Green function.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:26.220,00:06:27.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,After this scaling.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:28.880,00:06:35.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if you look at phi of 1, after the scaling by f of x1, remember this is f of x1.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:36.380,00:06:42.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,After you scale phi 1 to f of x1, the red function is going to be like that.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:43.980,00:06:44.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:45.860,00:06:53.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,That already allows us to reconstruct this gray line in the first element, in the first interval.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:56.220,00:07:03.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this green line, the scaled green line plus the scaled red line is going to be equal to the gray line in the first interval.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:05.820,00:07:16.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,And similarly, if we scale phi of 2 by f of x2, the black line after the scaling, because this is f of x2.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:18.220,00:07:22.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,After the scaling, the function becomes this.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:24.920,00:07:25.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:25.580,00:07:25.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the scaling.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:25.920,00:07:25.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the scaling.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:25.940,00:07:25.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the scaling.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:25.980,00:07:37.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,The scaled red line and the scaled black line, they combine together is going to reconstruct this function f in the second interval.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:38.160,00:07:49.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the blue line after scaling by a negative number, f of x3, which is here, is going to become this.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:50.000,00:07:50.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:50.420,00:07:52.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this negative hat is the scaled.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:52.700,00:07:56.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,Scaled blue line.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:57.500,00:08:04.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,And combined with the scaled black line, it is going to reconstruct this gray line in the third interval.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:05.460,00:08:14.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,And lastly, once we scale phi 4 by f of x4, or f of 1, we are going to get the scaled green line.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:15.740,00:08:20.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,Which combined with the blue line is going to give us f of x in the last interval.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:21.220,00:08:22.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any questions so far?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:22.420,00:08:22.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any questions so far?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:22.580,00:08:22.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any questions so far?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:22.660,00:08:25.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,In how do we represent a piecewise linear function?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:25.700,00:08:29.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,Piecewise linear and continuous function using these hat functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:29.720,00:08:47.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is not just true for this particular division we into four intervals, but this can be done for any subdivision of any interval in one dimensions.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:48.220,00:08:48.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:48.940,00:08:49.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:49.740,00:08:52.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you have any subdivision.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:52.420,00:08:57.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,of any interval, you can construct the head function so that they are equal to 1 at one
Dialogue: 0,00:08:57.300,00:09:02.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,grid point and equal to 0 at all other grid points.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:02.100,00:09:05.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,And once you have the value of the function at the grid points, you can simply connect
Dialogue: 0,00:09:05.700,00:09:11.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,the dots to form a head function.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:11.460,00:09:18.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now you have all the head functions, you scale the head function by the value of any particular
Dialogue: 0,00:09:18.120,00:09:24.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,known function at the corresponding grid points, you're going to get a collection of scaled
Dialogue: 0,00:09:24.880,00:09:27.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,head functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:27.040,00:09:33.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Once you sum up the scaled head functions, you get the function you're trying to reconstruct.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:33.880,00:09:41.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is an example of how do you use a basis set to represent any function within
Dialogue: 0,00:09:41.520,00:09:42.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,a linear space.
