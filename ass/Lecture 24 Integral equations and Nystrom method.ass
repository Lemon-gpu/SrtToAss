Dialogue: 0,00:01:31.760,00:01:34.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is not exactly a very informative statement,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:34.760,00:01:35.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,but there it is.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:35.760,00:01:36.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we're going to...
Dialogue: 0,00:01:36.760,00:01:38.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm going to go through a little bit of it.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:38.760,00:01:40.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the reason we're going to talk about quadrature
Dialogue: 0,00:01:40.760,00:01:42.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the ways in which you derive quadrature formulas
Dialogue: 0,00:01:42.760,00:01:44.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,is it will really lead into the next lecture,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:44.760,00:01:46.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is how you take these ideas from quadrature,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:46.760,00:01:48.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,which you may or may not have seen before,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:48.760,00:01:50.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,and how you can use them to develop
Dialogue: 0,00:01:50.760,00:01:51.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,the next lecture.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:51.760,00:01:53.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to go through a little bit of it.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:53.760,00:01:54.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I'm going to talk about the idea of quadrature,
Dialogue: 0,00:01:54.760,00:01:55.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,which you may or may not have seen before.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:55.760,00:01:57.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you can use them to actually come up with methods
Dialogue: 0,00:01:57.760,00:01:59.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,for solving integral equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:59.760,00:02:02.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And give you a method that's really extraordinarily effective
Dialogue: 0,00:02:02.760,00:02:04.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,in two space dimensions.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:04.760,00:02:06.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And doesn't necessarily generalize that easily
Dialogue: 0,00:02:06.760,00:02:08.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,to three dimensions,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:08.760,00:02:11.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,although there have been some recent improvements in that.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:11.760,00:02:14.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So part of the reason we're talking about quadrature
Dialogue: 0,00:02:14.760,00:02:17.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,is to fill in some background in case you're missing it,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:17.760,00:02:21.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,but partly because it's going to lead us right into
Dialogue: 0,00:02:21.760,00:02:23.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,a very effective way,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:23.760,00:02:25.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,one of the most effective ways of solving it,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:25.760,00:02:27.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,is to use the idea of integral equations
Dialogue: 0,00:02:27.760,00:02:29.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,in two space dimensions.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:29.760,00:02:31.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right, so what do we mean by quadrature?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:31.760,00:02:34.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that is we're going to approximate an integral
Dialogue: 0,00:02:34.760,00:02:37.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,by, which is of course just the area under a curve,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:37.760,00:02:40.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we want to do it with some formula.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:40.760,00:02:44.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,That is we're going to use values of a function and weights.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:44.760,00:02:46.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you're doing an integral from zero to one,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:46.760,00:02:48.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,which we'll probably do,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:48.760,00:02:50.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,we don't have the integral in that because
Dialogue: 0,00:02:50.760,00:02:53.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm just going to integrate this out to the x,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:53.760,00:02:55.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I'm trying to get the area under the curve.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:55.760,00:02:57.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm doing one.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:57.760,00:03:04.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I'm going to approximate it with this box card
Dialogue: 0,00:03:04.760,00:03:10.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,of height f and I'm evaluating it at x.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:10.760,00:03:14.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's not a very difficult quadrature scheme.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:14.760,00:03:21.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's an approximation,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:21.760,00:03:23.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we can come up with better approximations,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:23.760,00:03:25.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the obvious one is, well,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:25.760,00:03:28.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,if it doesn't work to approximate your function
Dialogue: 0,00:03:28.760,00:03:31.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,with one box card, maybe two will,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:31.760,00:03:33.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,box cards would be better.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:33.760,00:03:37.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm sure all of you have learned this in calculus
Dialogue: 0,00:03:37.760,00:03:42.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,that it would be better to use more box cards
Dialogue: 0,00:03:42.760,00:03:44.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,when you do the Rubin sum.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:44.760,00:03:46.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,But before we do that, let's talk a little bit about
Dialogue: 0,00:03:46.760,00:03:49.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,just this box card and what it's accurate for.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:49.760,00:03:54.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the extraordinary thing about that one box card
Dialogue: 0,00:03:54.760,00:03:58.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,is of course it's exact for a function that's a constant
Dialogue: 0,00:03:58.760,00:04:01.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,on the integral 0 to 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:01.760,00:04:07.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's also exact for anything that's a constant or a linear.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:07.760,00:04:11.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's actually a single point quadrature scheme.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:11.760,00:04:14.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's a lot more powerful than you think it is,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:14.760,00:04:20.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,and in fact it's more powerful than if I use one point on the x.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:20.760,00:04:23.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So suppose I look at these functions that are linear,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:23.760,00:04:25.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I want to get the area of the curve,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:25.760,00:04:32.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I have three choices about how to approximate it.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:32.760,00:04:44.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,I could use a point at the beginning of the integral,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:44.760,00:04:47.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,so I could use f of 0,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:47.760,00:04:52.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,or I could use, for that same linear function,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:52.760,00:05:03.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,f of 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:03.760,00:05:09.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And what can I say immediately about both these methods?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:09.760,00:05:15.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Do they work if the function is constant?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:15.760,00:05:19.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,If f of x equals a constant,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:19.760,00:05:22.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,are these formulas exact?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:22.760,00:05:23.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,All three.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:23.760,00:05:28.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we can sometimes call this one the midpoint,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:28.760,00:05:33.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,and both of these are called endpoint methods.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:35.760,00:05:39.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,The endpoint methods are exact.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:43.760,00:05:50.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,If it's constant, what if f of x is equal to a x plus a p?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:52.760,00:05:58.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Which of these formulas are exact?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:58.760,00:06:00.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,The midpoint and the endpoint?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:00.760,00:06:02.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Midpoint only.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:09.760,00:06:12.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we could sometimes, if we want to be formal about it,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:12.760,00:06:17.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,we could say the endpoint methods are good for polynomials of order 0,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:17.760,00:06:21.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the midpoint methods are good for polynomials of order 0 and order 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:22.760,00:06:26.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,That, in fact, that idea, the simple idea,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:26.760,00:06:29.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,thinking about what kind of polynomials, functions,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:29.760,00:06:32.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,you could exactly integrate the error out of the curve of,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:32.760,00:06:35.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,is the heart of everything you're going to learn about quadrature.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:35.760,00:06:41.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So everything else I'm going to tell you is an extension of that idea.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:41.760,00:06:43.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,We look at quadrature formulas,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:43.760,00:06:46.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we're going to ask questions about how high an order of polynomial
Dialogue: 0,00:06:46.760,00:06:48.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,we can exactly integrate.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:48.760,00:06:51.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that's going to tell us some way of comparing these methods.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:51.760,00:06:54.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in this very simple setting,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:54.760,00:06:58.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,we're going to start talking about a lot of things about these polynomials.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:58.760,00:07:01.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,But just keep in mind that simple idea.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:01.760,00:07:04.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,We're going to try to come up with methods
Dialogue: 0,00:07:04.760,00:07:08.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,that can accurately integrate higher and higher order polynomials,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:08.760,00:07:12.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,and that's how we're going to assess which method is better and which method is worse.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:12.760,00:07:20.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, if we want a method that's more accurate than the midpoint method,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:20.760,00:07:26.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,if our function is not a constant or a linear function,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:26.760,00:07:29.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's not a zero-th or first-order polynomial,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:29.760,00:07:33.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,then we could break it up into two box cards.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:33.760,00:07:37.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Does that accurately integrate a higher-order polynomial?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:37.760,00:07:41.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,That is, if I use two box cards in the midpoint method,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:41.760,00:07:44.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,can I exactly integrate any quadratic?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:50.760,00:07:55.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,What about if I use, instead of the midpoints for these two box cards,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:55.760,00:07:57.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,what if I used endpoints?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:57.760,00:08:01.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Would that exactly integrate any quadratic?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:01.760,00:08:04.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, what about a linear function?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:04.760,00:08:08.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,If I use two box cards, will the midpoint method exactly integrate

Dialogue: 0,00:08:11.760,00:08:15.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,If it's a straight line and I write this up into two box cards,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:15.760,00:08:19.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,will the midpoint method still integrate the linear case?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:19.760,00:08:20.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Exactly.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:20.760,00:08:22.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,What about if I use the endpoint method?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:22.760,00:08:25.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Will it integrate a linear one exactly?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:25.760,00:08:26.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,No.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:26.760,00:08:31.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, breaking up into more box cards, more sections,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:31.760,00:08:34.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,doesn't necessarily get you a higher-order polynomial
Dialogue: 0,00:08:34.760,00:08:37.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,unless you try to arrange for it.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:37.760,00:08:39.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, that's another thing you're going to worry about,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:39.760,00:08:42.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is, what should we do if we use lots of points?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:42.760,00:08:47.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And just using equal weights on the two points may not be the best thing to do,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:47.760,00:08:49.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,although, surprisingly,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:49.760,00:08:52.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,in important cases, it is, in fact, the best thing to do.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:52.760,00:08:53.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:53.760,00:08:56.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, but this is going to be our general problem.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:56.760,00:08:59.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,We're going to imagine, well, we can evaluate the function.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:59.760,00:09:01.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Presumably, you can evaluate the function.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:01.760,00:09:03.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,You don't want to evaluate the function too much
Dialogue: 0,00:09:03.760,00:09:06.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,because the function may be expensive to evaluate.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:06.760,00:09:10.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,It might be the result of some complicated calculation you're doing.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:10.760,00:09:15.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,It may be something as simple as evaluating 1 over r, 1 over distance.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:15.760,00:09:19.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,But usually, you want to minimize the number of evaluations you have to do.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:19.760,00:09:21.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And get the best answer you can get.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:21.760,00:09:23.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And you have two degrees of freedom.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:23.760,00:09:27.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I want to keep in mind these two degrees of freedom.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:27.760,00:09:37.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, we have, well, I should say, two types of degrees of freedom.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:46.760,00:09:48.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,The first type is
Dialogue: 0,00:09:48.760,00:09:51.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,the weights for each point.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:54.760,00:09:57.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,For each of the box charts, how much do you weight that point?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:57.760,00:10:00.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the second type is where to put the points.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:07.760,00:10:11.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And in looking at the midpoints of these two endpoint methods,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:11.760,00:10:12.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,we pick the weight of 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:12.760,00:10:14.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,We only have one point.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:14.760,00:10:17.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, weights, the freedom to pick weights doesn't really come into it.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:18.760,00:10:21.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,But we can see already, even in a one point quadrature scheme,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:21.760,00:10:24.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,that degree of freedom of where to put the weights,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:24.760,00:10:27.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,where to put them, that's an important degree of freedom.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:27.760,00:10:30.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if we use something like a midpoint rule
Dialogue: 0,00:10:30.760,00:10:33.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,for each one of a set, a collection of n boxes,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:33.760,00:10:37.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,we would put 1 over n as the weights, all weights being the same.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:37.760,00:10:41.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And each of the test points would be in the center of each of those box charts.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:41.760,00:10:45.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, that's a general midpoint formula.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:45.760,00:10:47.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And you might ask the question, is that the best thing to do?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:47.760,00:10:50.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Could you put the points in different locations?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:50.760,00:10:53.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Could you use different weights?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:53.760,00:10:59.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, if I have an endpoint scheme, how many degrees of freedom do I have?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:03.760,00:11:06.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, I've got n box charts.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:06.760,00:11:10.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,I can pick n points to, n places to put the,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:10.760,00:11:14.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,I can make the box charts thicker, thinner, so I can put the points anywhere.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:14.760,00:11:16.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,I've got n points to place.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:16.760,00:11:18.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,What about the weights?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:18.760,00:11:20.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Do I have n degrees of freedom in the weights?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:22.760,00:11:24.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,How many degrees of freedom do I have?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:24.760,00:11:26.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,What do I know about the weights?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:26.760,00:11:28.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,They all have to sum to 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:28.760,00:11:30.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Why do they have to sum to 1?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:32.760,00:11:35.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Suppose f of x were a constant of 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:36.760,00:11:40.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then that formula should produce exactly the right integral,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:40.760,00:11:42.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,which would be 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:42.760,00:11:44.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, that's why the weights have to sum to 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:44.760,00:11:46.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,But that idea doesn't exist.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:46.760,00:11:48.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,The idea that the weights have to sum to 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:48.760,00:11:52.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,when you think about that, yeah, of course,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:52.760,00:11:55.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,because it's got to integrate the constant function exactly,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:55.760,00:12:01.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,but that's like saying the weights have to be such that the 0th order polynomial gets integrated exactly.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:03.760,00:12:05.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,We get another condition on the weights,
Dialogue: 0,00:12:05.760,00:12:10.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,so that we exactly integrate a constant and a first order polynomial.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:10.760,00:12:16.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, we're going to think a little bit about that.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:16.760,00:12:24.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, there are three different methods we could look at.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:24.760,00:12:28.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,We could use one method, which is an endpoint method.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:28.760,00:12:31.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,We use the beginning of each of these box bars.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:31.760,00:12:33.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,A second method, the one we've been looking at mostly,
Dialogue: 0,00:12:33.760,00:12:34.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,is a midpoint method.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:34.760,00:12:36.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,We pick up points in the middle.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:36.760,00:12:39.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the third one is sometimes referred to as the trapezoidal rule.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:39.760,00:12:42.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And why is it called the trapezoidal rule?
Dialogue: 0,00:12:42.760,00:12:51.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because you can't see it here, because it's not clear enough in the picture.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:51.760,00:12:54.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,But each of these things are trapezoids.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:54.760,00:12:58.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,They're straight line approximations for whatever that function is.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:58.760,00:13:01.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Which is the best one to use?
Dialogue: 0,00:13:01.760,00:13:08.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is the trapezoidal one better, or the midpoint one?
Dialogue: 0,00:13:08.760,00:13:10.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Midpoint.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:10.760,00:13:11.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Say again?
Dialogue: 0,00:13:11.760,00:13:12.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Midpoint.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:12.760,00:13:15.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, it turns out the midpoint one is better.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:15.760,00:13:20.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,The trapezoidal rule is, it's putting a straight line between points.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:20.760,00:13:23.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, I'm going to draw a picture of that so you can see why.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:25.760,00:13:27.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, imagine I have a curve like this,
Dialogue: 0,00:13:27.760,00:13:29.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I deal with the trapezoidal rule,
Dialogue: 0,00:13:29.760,00:13:31.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I just exaggerate it.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:31.760,00:13:33.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, these are going to be my trapezoids.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:38.760,00:13:53.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, I've got two trapezoids.
Dialogue: 0,00:13:53.760,00:13:56.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I have an error.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:01.760,00:14:04.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,For that same curve, what would the midpoint rule do?
Dialogue: 0,00:14:08.760,00:14:10.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,I have my two box cards.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:10.760,00:14:12.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,What does the midpoint rule do?
Dialogue: 0,00:14:15.760,00:14:17.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's going to use the point square.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:26.760,00:14:29.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,If I use the midpoint rule, what value am I going to use?
Dialogue: 0,00:14:29.760,00:14:30.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,A middle.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:30.760,00:14:32.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I'm going to pick a middle point.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:35.760,00:14:36.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that means,
Dialogue: 0,00:14:36.760,00:14:38.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,my midpoint rule looks like this.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:43.760,00:14:44.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, by looking at these two pictures,
Dialogue: 0,00:14:44.760,00:14:47.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,it should be obvious to you that the midpoint rule is going to be better.
Dialogue: 0,00:14:47.760,00:14:48.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:14:48.760,00:14:50.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is that obvious?
Dialogue: 0,00:14:51.760,00:14:53.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is the terror smaller?
Dialogue: 0,00:14:57.760,00:14:59.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,If I drew a slightly different curve,
Dialogue: 0,00:14:59.760,00:15:01.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,could I get a different answer to this question?
Dialogue: 0,00:15:04.760,00:15:05.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Maybe.
Dialogue: 0,00:15:06.760,00:15:09.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,If I happen to pick a piecewise constant curve,
Dialogue: 0,00:15:09.760,00:15:11.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,my curve is this, the rooftop,
Dialogue: 0,00:15:11.760,00:15:16.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,then trapezoidal and midpoint will both get exactly the right answer.
Dialogue: 0,00:15:17.760,00:15:18.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,After that?
Dialogue: 0,00:15:19.760,00:15:20.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright, so,
Dialogue: 0,00:15:21.760,00:15:24.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,it can be a little difficult to decide some of these questions,
Dialogue: 0,00:15:24.760,00:15:27.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,even in this simple setting, about error.
Dialogue: 0,00:15:27.760,00:15:30.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And so, we need some more formal methods to think about it.
Dialogue: 0,00:15:30.760,00:15:33.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And it also turns out we need some tricks.
Dialogue: 0,00:15:33.760,00:15:35.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well, numerical insights.
Dialogue: 0,00:15:36.760,00:15:40.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,It will help us actually come up with ideas about where to put points
Dialogue: 0,00:15:40.760,00:15:42.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,and how to set weights.
Dialogue: 0,00:15:42.760,00:15:43.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright, so,
Dialogue: 0,00:15:43.760,00:15:46.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,for the moment, we're going to worry about
Dialogue: 0,00:15:46.760,00:15:48.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,a general, positive formula,
Dialogue: 0,00:15:48.760,00:15:52.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,where we think of picking the weights
Dialogue: 0,00:15:52.760,00:15:54.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,and picking the evaluation points,
Dialogue: 0,00:15:54.760,00:15:57.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,and that will give us 2n degrees of freedom.
Dialogue: 0,00:15:57.760,00:15:59.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Where the way you normally think of the weights,
Dialogue: 0,00:15:59.760,00:16:01.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,I can double the weights up to sum to 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:16:01.760,00:16:03.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,that's a constraint.
Dialogue: 0,00:16:03.760,00:16:05.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we're going to see if we want,
Dialogue: 0,00:16:05.760,00:16:09.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,that's a constraint to make sure that we get the exact answer for a constant.
Dialogue: 0,00:16:09.760,00:16:12.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,But it's one of a whole family of constraints.
Dialogue: 0,00:16:12.760,00:16:15.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, we're going to think about having these 2n degrees of freedom,
Dialogue: 0,00:16:15.760,00:16:19.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,but we're going to very quickly see that we're going to need to put some constraints on it
Dialogue: 0,00:16:19.760,00:16:21.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,to try to get good accuracy.
Dialogue: 0,00:16:21.760,00:16:23.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, we're going to pick the evaluation points,
Dialogue: 0,00:16:23.760,00:16:25.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we're going to pick the weights.
Dialogue: 0,00:16:25.760,00:16:27.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, how should we do that?
Dialogue: 0,00:16:28.760,00:16:31.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, we already started talking about the key idea.
Dialogue: 0,00:16:31.760,00:16:33.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,What I said was the key idea.
Dialogue: 0,00:16:33.760,00:16:34.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,The polynomial.
Dialogue: 0,00:16:35.760,00:16:37.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,We are going to say I have this function,
Dialogue: 0,00:16:37.760,00:16:43.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I'm going to say I can approximate it well with a polynomial up to Lth order.
Dialogue: 0,00:16:43.760,00:16:47.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And what we're going to try to do is to pick the points and the weights,
Dialogue: 0,00:16:47.760,00:16:52.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,so that it accurately integrates any polynomial up to as high an order as possible.
Dialogue: 0,00:16:55.760,00:17:02.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, we can, by picking the points and the weights,
Dialogue: 0,00:17:02.760,00:17:04.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,because we have 2n degrees of freedom,
Dialogue: 0,00:17:05.760,00:17:08.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,we can actually come up with points and weights
Dialogue: 0,00:17:08.760,00:17:14.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,that will exactly integrate any polynomial up to the Lth order,

Dialogue: 0,00:17:18.760,00:17:20.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Why 2n minus 1?
Dialogue: 0,00:17:20.760,00:17:22.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,What does the minus 1 tell you?
Dialogue: 0,00:17:24.760,00:17:29.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, how many coefficients does an Lth order polynomial have if I write it this way?
Dialogue: 0,00:17:32.760,00:17:34.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well, because I wrote it from a0 and a1,
Dialogue: 0,00:17:35.760,00:17:37.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,all the way to aL.
Dialogue: 0,00:17:37.760,00:17:40.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you're a programmer and you write software a lot,
Dialogue: 0,00:17:40.760,00:17:45.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,you count from 0, then of course you know that's L plus 1 coefficients.
Dialogue: 0,00:17:45.760,00:17:47.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's where the 1 is coming from.
Dialogue: 0,00:17:47.760,00:17:51.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,The Lth is the order, but the number of degrees of freedom is L plus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:17:51.760,00:17:57.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, we can get to an Lth order polynomial means we have L plus 1 coefficients
Dialogue: 0,00:17:57.760,00:18:02.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,of that polynomial, and that we're going to match to the degrees of freedom
Dialogue: 0,00:18:02.760,00:18:06.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,in our quadrature scheme.
Dialogue: 0,00:18:06.760,00:18:09.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, we have 2n coefficients we have to find,
Dialogue: 0,00:18:09.760,00:18:13.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,and that means we can match 2n coefficients of a polynomial,
Dialogue: 0,00:18:13.760,00:18:18.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,and that means L plus 1 is equal to 2n, or L equals 2n minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:18:18.760,00:18:22.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, that should be easy.
Dialogue: 0,00:18:22.760,00:18:25.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, how are we going to do that?
Dialogue: 0,00:18:25.760,00:18:28.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,I've got points and weights,
Dialogue: 0,00:18:28.760,00:18:31.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I want to make sure that we pick the points and the weights,
Dialogue: 0,00:18:31.760,00:18:37.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,so we exactly integrate any polynomial of order up to L.
Dialogue: 0,00:18:37.760,00:18:44.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,How do I figure out where those points and weights are?
Dialogue: 0,00:18:44.760,00:18:48.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Can I write down a system of equations and solve it?
Dialogue: 0,00:18:48.760,00:18:51.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Can I just go ahead and do that?
Dialogue: 0,00:18:51.760,00:18:54.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,We're going to talk about that in a little bit.
Dialogue: 0,00:18:54.760,00:18:57.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,But I wanted to say something about the error estimates,
Dialogue: 0,00:18:57.760,00:19:00.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,because these methods, when you do this,
Dialogue: 0,00:19:00.760,00:19:05.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,doing the midpoint rule with boxcars,
Dialogue: 0,00:19:05.760,00:19:08.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,or doing something like this, where you pick the points and weights
Dialogue: 0,00:19:08.760,00:19:12.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,to exactly integrate as high an order polynomial as possible,
Dialogue: 0,00:19:12.760,00:19:15.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,they have very different convergence properties.
Dialogue: 0,00:19:15.760,00:19:18.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,The Gaussian quadrature, or any quadrature scheme,
Dialogue: 0,00:19:18.760,00:19:21.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,based on trying to match as high an order polynomial as possible,
Dialogue: 0,00:19:21.760,00:19:26.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,has what we call spectral convergence.
Dialogue: 0,00:19:26.760,00:19:29.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, normally, when you refine a discretization,
Dialogue: 0,00:19:29.760,00:19:35.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,you figure, alright, if it's in a cubic order method,
Dialogue: 0,00:19:35.760,00:19:40.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,you might expect that if I half the number of the step size in my discretization,
Dialogue: 0,00:19:40.760,00:19:43.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,then maybe the error goes down by a factor of 8.
Dialogue: 0,00:19:43.760,00:19:46.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or maybe I have a second order method,
Dialogue: 0,00:19:46.760,00:19:48.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,and in this case the error goes down by a factor of 4.
Dialogue: 0,00:19:48.760,00:19:51.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or a first order method goes down by a factor of 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:19:51.760,00:19:54.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,You have this idea that it is the refinement.
Dialogue: 0,00:19:54.760,00:19:58.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,I take the discretization, I use twice as many points,
Dialogue: 0,00:19:58.760,00:20:01.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,I get twice as much accuracy,
Dialogue: 0,00:20:01.760,00:20:05.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,if it's first order, 4 times as much accuracy if it's second order,
Dialogue: 0,00:20:05.760,00:20:08.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,8 times as much accuracy if it's third order.
Dialogue: 0,00:20:08.760,00:20:12.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,What do you think you get with Gaussian quadrature?
Dialogue: 0,00:20:12.760,00:20:16.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, what that formula means, although it's a little hard to tease out from the factorial way,
Dialogue: 0,00:20:16.760,00:20:19.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's usually, it's formally presented.
Dialogue: 0,00:20:19.760,00:20:23.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,It says that for every point I add,
Dialogue: 0,00:20:23.760,00:20:26.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,the accuracy increases by a factor of 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:20:26.760,00:20:33.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, it's not going down like 1 over,
Dialogue: 0,00:20:33.760,00:20:39.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's not going down linearly or quadratically or cubically with the number of points,
Dialogue: 0,00:20:39.760,00:20:44.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's going down exponentially fast with the number of points.
Dialogue: 0,00:20:44.760,00:20:48.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So imagine how many, if you want to get 16 digits of accuracy,
Dialogue: 0,00:20:48.760,00:20:51.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,2 points gets you 1 digit,
Dialogue: 0,00:20:51.760,00:20:55.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,then 3 points gets you 4 digits.
Dialogue: 0,00:20:55.760,00:20:58.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,4 points gets you 8 digits.
Dialogue: 0,00:20:58.760,00:21:01.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,5 points gets you 16 digits.
Dialogue: 0,00:21:01.760,00:21:03.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,When we're talking about these methods,
Dialogue: 0,00:21:03.760,00:21:08.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,we're talking about methods that have extraordinary rapid convergence
Dialogue: 0,00:21:08.760,00:21:11.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,when they count on certain properties.
Dialogue: 0,00:21:11.760,00:21:14.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we're going to come back and talk a little bit about what those properties are,
Dialogue: 0,00:21:14.760,00:21:17.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,but unfortunately for the integrals,
Dialogue: 0,00:21:17.760,00:21:20.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,in this class, they violate the properties for which that's true
Dialogue: 0,00:21:20.760,00:21:23.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,in many of the cases, but not all of them.
Dialogue: 0,00:21:23.760,00:21:25.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we'll look at some important ones that show up in 2D.
Dialogue: 0,00:21:25.760,00:21:28.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright, so, let's look at an example.
Dialogue: 0,00:21:28.760,00:21:30.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, it's, you know, I'm going to take,
Dialogue: 0,00:21:30.760,00:21:32.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,alright, what does spectral accuracy mean,
Dialogue: 0,00:21:32.760,00:21:34.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,what does it really look like when we're talking about this?
Dialogue: 0,00:21:34.760,00:21:36.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, I'm taking the sine function,
Dialogue: 0,00:21:36.760,00:21:41.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm going to do the sine function and integrate it with a quadrature scheme
Dialogue: 0,00:21:41.760,00:21:44.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,because we can exactly integrate the sine function with it all.
Dialogue: 0,00:21:44.760,00:21:46.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm going to try to do that in calculus.
Dialogue: 0,00:21:46.760,00:21:47.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And what's true about the sine function?
Dialogue: 0,00:21:47.760,00:21:51.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Why do you think I picked that function?
Dialogue: 0,00:21:51.760,00:21:53.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, do any of its derivatives go to 0?
Dialogue: 0,00:21:53.760,00:21:55.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is there any polynomial that,
Dialogue: 0,00:21:55.760,00:21:58.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,that exactly describes the sine function?
Dialogue: 0,00:21:58.760,00:22:02.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, if it did, then I could differentiate the sine function
Dialogue: 0,00:22:02.760,00:22:03.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,a certain number of times,
Dialogue: 0,00:22:03.760,00:22:06.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,and at some point the derivatives would go to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:22:06.760,00:22:07.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,But that never happens, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:22:07.760,00:22:09.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,If I differentiate the sine function,
Dialogue: 0,00:22:09.760,00:22:13.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,and differentiate, I get sine, cosine, sine, cosine, sine, cosine, sine, cosine,
Dialogue: 0,00:22:13.760,00:22:15.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,derivative never goes to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:22:15.760,00:22:19.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, it's not described exactly by a finite number of polynomials.
Dialogue: 0,00:22:19.760,00:22:22.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And it gives us a chance to look at the convergence properties
Dialogue: 0,00:22:22.760,00:22:25.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,of a method for which we actually know the exact number.
Dialogue: 0,00:22:25.760,00:22:27.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, let's look at the answer.
Dialogue: 0,00:22:27.760,00:22:30.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, this is the error analysis,
Dialogue: 0,00:22:30.760,00:22:32.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,and this is looking at the point,
Dialogue: 0,00:22:32.760,00:22:36.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,the log-log plot of error versus number of points.
Dialogue: 0,00:22:36.760,00:22:40.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if you look at this scheme and say,
Dialogue: 0,00:22:40.760,00:22:42.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,well, what happens when I increase the number of points
Dialogue: 0,00:22:42.760,00:22:44.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,by an order of magnitude?
Dialogue: 0,00:22:44.760,00:22:47.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,What happens to the error in this plot?
Dialogue: 0,00:22:47.760,00:22:51.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, an order of magnitude increases the number of quadrature points,
Dialogue: 0,00:22:51.760,00:22:54.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,meaning I break it up into an order of magnitude and one section,
Dialogue: 0,00:22:54.760,00:22:57.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,and an order of magnitude, more evaluations.
Dialogue: 0,00:22:57.760,00:23:03.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,How much does the error go down?
Dialogue: 0,00:23:03.760,00:23:04.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well, you look at it,
Dialogue: 0,00:23:04.760,00:23:07.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,an order of magnitude on the bottom curve looks roughly like,
Dialogue: 0,00:23:07.760,00:23:10.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,how many orders of magnitude on the side?
Dialogue: 0,00:23:10.760,00:23:13.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, we're looking at a plot of error versus number of points.
Dialogue: 0,00:23:13.760,00:23:14.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Two looks sort of like,
Dialogue: 0,00:23:14.760,00:23:16.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,and that would be a second-order method.
Dialogue: 0,00:23:16.760,00:23:19.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,You increase the number of points by a factor of 10,
Dialogue: 0,00:23:19.760,00:23:22.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the error goes down by a factor of 100.
Dialogue: 0,00:23:22.760,00:23:24.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,That seems pretty good.
Dialogue: 0,00:23:24.760,00:23:27.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,It means that, you know, with 1,000 points,
Dialogue: 0,00:23:27.760,00:23:31.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,10,000 points, we can almost get machine precision.
Dialogue: 0,00:23:31.760,00:23:35.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, that's not a quadrature scheme.
Dialogue: 0,00:23:35.760,00:23:39.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,That was, which of these three methods do you think was the midpoint rule
Dialogue: 0,00:23:39.760,00:23:41.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,or the endpoint rule?
Dialogue: 0,00:23:41.760,00:23:43.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, it turned out it was the midpoint,
Dialogue: 0,00:23:43.760,00:23:47.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,because the endpoint rule doesn't have such rapid convergence.
Dialogue: 0,00:23:47.760,00:23:49.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, I'll come back if there's time
Dialogue: 0,00:23:49.760,00:23:51.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,and talk a little bit about the Taylor series of values,
Dialogue: 0,00:23:51.760,00:23:53.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,but I just wanted to make a point about it,
Dialogue: 0,00:23:53.760,00:23:57.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,because it's the heart of why the methods that we're using work.
Dialogue: 0,00:23:57.760,00:24:00.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,If I do a Taylor series expansion of a function,
Dialogue: 0,00:24:00.760,00:24:04.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,as long as it has, it's infinitely continuously differentiable.
Dialogue: 0,00:24:04.760,00:24:08.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, sine functions are infinitely continuously differentiable.
Dialogue: 0,00:24:08.760,00:24:10.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then I can write down the Taylor series expansion
Dialogue: 0,00:24:10.760,00:24:13.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,for f of x at every point x.
Dialogue: 0,00:24:13.760,00:24:17.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that means up to a Taylor series residual,
Dialogue: 0,00:24:17.760,00:24:21.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,I can write down a polynomial representation of f of x.
Dialogue: 0,00:24:21.760,00:24:23.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And when I do a,
Dialogue: 0,00:24:23.760,00:24:26.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,a quadrature scheme that's exact for that polynomial,
Dialogue: 0,00:24:26.760,00:24:29.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,it means we'll pick up that order for Taylor series,
Dialogue: 0,00:24:29.760,00:24:32.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,but we'll miss out on the remainder term.
Dialogue: 0,00:24:32.760,00:24:35.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the remainder term for the Taylor series expansion
Dialogue: 0,00:24:35.760,00:24:37.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,is this thing that has a coefficient in front of it
Dialogue: 0,00:24:37.760,00:24:39.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,that goes like the factorial,
Dialogue: 0,00:24:39.760,00:24:41.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,and also is the derivative.
Dialogue: 0,00:24:41.760,00:24:44.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, looking at this Taylor series expansion, it says,
Dialogue: 0,00:24:44.760,00:24:48.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,if we're going to do something that's exact for polynomials,
Dialogue: 0,00:24:48.760,00:24:50.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,for progressively higher-order polynomials,
Dialogue: 0,00:24:50.760,00:24:52.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,we want something towards the Taylor series
Dialogue: 0,00:24:52.760,00:24:54.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,remainder theorem works.
Dialogue: 0,00:24:54.760,00:24:58.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,It means we want something that's infinitely differentiable,
Dialogue: 0,00:24:58.760,00:25:01.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,and one has to be true about the derivatives.
Dialogue: 0,00:25:01.760,00:25:03.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,These derivatives are going off to infinity
Dialogue: 0,00:25:03.760,00:25:06.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,as you differentiate more and more and more.
Dialogue: 0,00:25:06.760,00:25:08.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's not so good.
Dialogue: 0,00:25:08.760,00:25:10.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,If they go up, if the derivatives go up faster
Dialogue: 0,00:25:10.760,00:25:12.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,than the factorial goes down,
Dialogue: 0,00:25:12.760,00:25:14.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,then these methods aren't going to be very good.
Dialogue: 0,00:25:14.760,00:25:16.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, we want things that are smooth

Dialogue: 0,00:26:30.760,00:26:35.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, we have this idea that any smooth function,

Dialogue: 0,00:26:46.760,00:26:48.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,the smaller this remainder term is,
Dialogue: 0,00:26:48.760,00:26:50.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,and it goes down really, really fast.
Dialogue: 0,00:26:50.760,00:26:56.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, how do we do that?
Dialogue: 0,00:26:56.760,00:26:59.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, we're going to produce this exactness condition,

Dialogue: 0,00:28:38.760,00:28:42.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we want this to be exact for all polys

Dialogue: 0,00:29:00.760,00:29:02.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,by just writing down

Dialogue: 0,00:30:43.760,00:30:49.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that means we have 2n minus 1 degrees of freedom.

Dialogue: 0,00:34:39.760,00:34:42.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,But we're going to try to develop some intuition about what's going on
Dialogue: 0,00:34:42.760,00:34:47.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,just by thinking about that matrix that involves the x's.

Dialogue: 0,00:35:10.760,00:35:15.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,But it gets progressively less well conditioned as l goes up in order.
Dialogue: 0,00:35:15.760,00:35:20.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And a quick way to see that is to think there's the constant polynomial,

Dialogue: 0,00:35:24.760,00:35:27.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is when we get to the Jacobian and Newton's method,

Dialogue: 0,00:35:30.760,00:35:33.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, if you're going to write a linear polynomial,
Dialogue: 0,00:35:33.760,00:35:34.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,you're going to have to think about the x-thigh of the x.
Dialogue: 0,00:35:34.760,00:35:37.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is a picture of a plot of the rows.
Dialogue: 0,00:35:37.760,00:35:41.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Just take each row and plot its points from zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:35:41.760,00:35:49.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the x1 through xa along the x axis,

Dialogue: 0,00:39:16.480,00:39:18.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,features. It makes very easy to generate these matrices, for

Dialogue: 0,00:39:22.880,00:39:27.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,look a lot like each other as you go to higher order. So if I
Dialogue: 0,00:39:27.440,00:39:31.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,told you about I have this set of vectors, and they're starting
Dialogue: 0,00:39:31.420,00:39:32.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,to look more and more like each other.
Dialogue: 0,00:39:33.280,00:39:36.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,And as I get more and more of these vectors, I kind of want to

Dialogue: 0,00:39:38.960,00:39:42.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,vectors to use. What scheme would you do to try to make to be able
Dialogue: 0,00:39:42.580,00:39:47.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,to tease those different pieces apart? So I have a set of vectors
Dialogue: 0,00:39:47.980,00:39:50.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,and they're almost linearly dependent. And I want to turn
Dialogue: 0,00:39:50.200,00:39:54.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,them into something that is as close to orthogonal as possible.
Dialogue: 0,00:39:55.220,00:40:02.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,What scheme would I use? So I have a set of columns of a
Dialogue: 0,00:40:02.120,00:40:02.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,matrix, and I want to make a column of a matrix. And I want to
Dialogue: 0,00:40:02.860,00:40:03.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,make a column of a matrix. And I want to make a column of a matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:40:03.280,00:40:03.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to call the vector in this case. And when I call the
Dialogue: 0,00:40:03.640,00:40:03.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,vector of a matrix, I'm going to call it a set of columns orthogonal
Dialogue: 0,00:40:03.920,00:40:07.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,to each other. What do I do? Same person invented this algorithm
Dialogue: 0,00:40:07.940,00:40:17.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,invented some kind of cracker, Graham Schmidt. Remember Graham
Dialogue: 0,00:40:17.300,00:40:24.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Schmidt orthogonalization? No. All right, so then we're not going
Dialogue: 0,00:40:24.840,00:40:27.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,to worry about when we calculate these polynomials, but let's,
Dialogue: 0,00:40:27.580,00:40:31.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,for a moment, assume that we could come up with orthogonal

Dialogue: 0,00:40:37.340,00:40:39.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,We're instead, because the monomials start to look like each other,

Dialogue: 0,00:40:46.580,00:40:47.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,So instead,
Dialogue: 0,00:40:48.140,00:40:53.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,we're going to try to come up with polynomials

Dialogue: 0,00:40:56.520,00:40:59.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we're going to define very different as something like this.

Dialogue: 0,00:41:25.080,00:41:28.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you've seen how little in trying to construct basic functions of the orthogonal
Dialogue: 0,00:41:28.580,00:41:29.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,can give you better conditions.
Dialogue: 0,00:41:29.860,00:41:31.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,You can't do the same thing with condition systems
Dialogue: 0,00:41:31.860,00:41:34.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,when you do a basis function based discretization of PDEs.
Dialogue: 0,00:41:34.860,00:41:40.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,But you also have it in a very much simpler setting.
Dialogue: 0,00:41:40.860,00:41:42.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,We're doing the same thing,
Dialogue: 0,00:41:42.860,00:41:45.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,if I took these polynomials and sampled them,
Dialogue: 0,00:41:45.860,00:41:47.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,I would get a vector,
Dialogue: 0,00:41:47.860,00:41:50.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then we're still talking about trying to make these two vectors orthogonal to each other.
Dialogue: 0,00:41:50.860,00:41:54.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it doesn't matter whether you think of this as a polynomial,
Dialogue: 0,00:41:54.860,00:41:57.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,two polynomials who want to make orthogonal to each other,
Dialogue: 0,00:41:57.860,00:41:59.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,or you think of representing them as a vector,
Dialogue: 0,00:41:59.860,00:42:01.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,but you're actually going to be using a function with points,
Dialogue: 0,00:42:01.860,00:42:03.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we're trying to say the two vectors,
Dialogue: 0,00:42:03.860,00:42:06.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,like the picture we drew here.
Dialogue: 0,00:42:06.860,00:42:08.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,If we think of these as vectors,
Dialogue: 0,00:42:08.860,00:42:12.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,we're now going to end up with vectors whose inner product is going to be 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:42:13.860,00:42:16.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,And now how are we going to construct those polynomials?
Dialogue: 0,00:42:16.860,00:42:19.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well, I'll come back.
Dialogue: 0,00:42:20.860,00:42:22.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's pretend we have them first.
Dialogue: 0,00:42:22.860,00:42:24.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Suppose we could construct polynomials.
Dialogue: 0,00:42:24.860,00:42:26.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So here's one, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:42:26.860,00:42:28.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's the polynomial 1, all 1s,
Dialogue: 0,00:42:28.860,00:42:30.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the polynomial x.
Dialogue: 0,00:42:30.860,00:42:33.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Are they orthogonal to each other?
Dialogue: 0,00:42:33.860,00:42:37.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,If I take the inner product of 1 and x and integrate it from 0 to 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:42:37.860,00:42:39.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,are those two orthogonal to each other?
Dialogue: 0,00:42:39.860,00:42:41.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Not at all.
Dialogue: 0,00:42:41.860,00:42:45.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Can you give me a polynomial that has a first order and a zeroth order term
Dialogue: 0,00:42:45.860,00:42:48.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,that is orthogonal to 1?
Dialogue: 0,00:42:52.860,00:42:55.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I have 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:42:55.860,00:42:57.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and...
Dialogue: 0,00:42:58.860,00:43:08.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So give me a polynomial that involves x,
Dialogue: 0,00:43:08.860,00:43:10.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,but is orthogonal to 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:43:10.860,00:43:13.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,1 minus 2x.
Dialogue: 0,00:43:13.860,00:43:15.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,1 minus 2x.
Dialogue: 0,00:43:15.860,00:43:18.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I've got to put a sign in the x.
Dialogue: 0,00:43:18.860,00:43:20.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So suppose I wrote down,
Dialogue: 0,00:43:20.860,00:43:23.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,if I have x and I'm going from 0 to 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:43:23.860,00:43:26.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I want its inner product to be 0 with 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:43:26.860,00:43:28.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,what am I going to subtract off?
Dialogue: 0,00:43:28.860,00:43:33.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what you said is exactly right.
Dialogue: 0,00:43:33.860,00:43:35.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,You said it.
Dialogue: 0,00:43:35.860,00:43:37.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,But I'm going to scale it slightly differently.
Dialogue: 0,00:43:37.860,00:43:40.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,I have x. It goes from 0 to 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:43:40.860,00:43:42.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I now want it to be orthogonal to 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:43:42.860,00:43:47.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I take the inner product of the constant
Dialogue: 0,00:43:47.860,00:43:49.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,with something that's linear.
Dialogue: 0,00:43:49.860,00:43:52.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,What do I want to make this linear function do
Dialogue: 0,00:43:52.860,00:43:56.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,so that the inner product of these two is a constant?
Dialogue: 0,00:43:56.860,00:43:58.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Excuse me, 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:44:04.860,00:44:06.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,What should this function be?
Dialogue: 0,00:44:06.860,00:44:07.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's got to have the x in it,
Dialogue: 0,00:44:07.860,00:44:09.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,because it's got to be in my mind.
Dialogue: 0,00:44:09.860,00:44:10.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,What should I do with it?
Dialogue: 0,00:44:10.860,00:44:12.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,All I've got to do is shift it somewhere.
Dialogue: 0,00:44:12.860,00:44:14.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Where?
Dialogue: 0,00:44:14.860,00:44:17.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,If I take this point at a half,
Dialogue: 0,00:44:17.860,00:44:20.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and make sure it goes through the half,
Dialogue: 0,00:44:20.860,00:44:23.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,are these two orthogonal to each other?
Dialogue: 0,00:44:23.860,00:44:25.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I got this one.
Dialogue: 0,00:44:26.860,00:44:31.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,The second one, by taking the 0th order polynomial
Dialogue: 0,00:44:31.860,00:44:36.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and subtracting some fraction of it off the first order polynomial.
Dialogue: 0,00:44:36.860,00:44:38.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now you can do that scheme.
Dialogue: 0,00:44:38.860,00:44:40.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,You can do a second order polynomial
Dialogue: 0,00:44:40.860,00:44:42.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,by starting with x squared
Dialogue: 0,00:44:42.860,00:44:44.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then subtracting whatever it takes
Dialogue: 0,00:44:44.860,00:44:47.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,to make the x squared orthogonal to the first order polynomial
Dialogue: 0,00:44:47.860,00:44:51.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and subtracting off whatever makes it x squared orthogonal to the constant polynomial.
Dialogue: 0,00:44:51.860,00:44:53.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we can construct polynomials this way.
Dialogue: 0,00:44:53.860,00:44:55.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,But I'm not going to worry so much about that at the moment.
Dialogue: 0,00:44:56.860,00:45:03.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's presume that we can figure out how to do that.
Dialogue: 0,00:45:03.860,00:45:08.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So suppose we recast our exact instance constraint
Dialogue: 0,00:45:08.860,00:45:10.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,with these orthogonal polynomials.
Dialogue: 0,00:45:10.860,00:45:12.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well, we have, we can't just pick any polynomials.
Dialogue: 0,00:45:12.860,00:45:15.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,They have to have, the 0th order polynomial has to have
Dialogue: 0,00:45:15.860,00:45:18.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,the monomials, the x to the 0 monomials.
Dialogue: 0,00:45:18.860,00:45:21.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,The first order one has to have the x1 monomials.
Dialogue: 0,00:45:21.860,00:45:24.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,The second order one has to have the x squared monomials.
Dialogue: 0,00:45:24.860,00:45:26.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,But other than that, they can have whatever way
Dialogue: 0,00:45:26.860,00:45:28.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,to do the combination of lower order polynomials,
Dialogue: 0,00:45:28.860,00:45:30.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,lower order monomials,
Dialogue: 0,00:45:30.860,00:45:32.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,to make them orthogonal to each other.
Dialogue: 0,00:45:32.860,00:45:34.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we imagine then saying,
Dialogue: 0,00:45:34.860,00:45:38.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,alright, we started out with n monomials.
Dialogue: 0,00:45:38.860,00:45:42.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or, excuse me, 2n monomials.
Dialogue: 0,00:45:42.860,00:45:50.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or the 0th order 1 plus all the way to order 2n minus 1 in monomials.
Dialogue: 0,00:45:50.860,00:45:53.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have our 2n constraints starting from the complex term
Dialogue: 0,00:45:53.860,00:45:55.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,all the way to the 0th order polynomial.
Dialogue: 0,00:45:55.860,00:45:59.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we're going to replace those monomial constraints
Dialogue: 0,00:45:59.860,00:46:04.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,with constraints using these orthogonal polynomials.
Dialogue: 0,00:46:04.860,00:46:09.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,It should be, because it should be good enough.
Dialogue: 0,00:46:09.860,00:46:13.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean, any set of polynomials, as long as we can guarantee
Dialogue: 0,00:46:13.860,00:46:15.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,that we can write down any polynomials
Dialogue: 0,00:46:15.860,00:46:17.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,away the combination of this orthogonal set,
Dialogue: 0,00:46:17.860,00:46:21.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,which you can, you can certainly, each of these is involving monomials.
Dialogue: 0,00:46:21.860,00:46:24.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we can put them together in ways to make the,
Dialogue: 0,00:46:24.860,00:46:27.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,you know, whatever polynomial we want.
Dialogue: 0,00:46:27.860,00:46:30.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have certainly covered our constraints.
Dialogue: 0,00:46:30.860,00:46:34.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,But now we're putting it in terms of these orthogonal polynomials.
Dialogue: 0,00:46:34.860,00:46:39.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, an 0th order polynomial still has to have x to the lth power.
Dialogue: 0,00:46:39.860,00:46:41.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,But it could have any of the lower order terms.
Dialogue: 0,00:46:41.860,00:46:44.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,And because of that, we can represent any polynomial
Dialogue: 0,00:46:44.860,00:46:47.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,with a weighted combination of these orthogonal polynomials.
Dialogue: 0,00:46:47.860,00:46:50.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we can rewrite our constraints.
Dialogue: 0,00:46:50.860,00:46:53.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is this going to make our problem any easier?
Dialogue: 0,00:46:53.860,00:46:57.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,We still have two n constraints.
Dialogue: 0,00:46:57.860,00:47:03.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Are these now constraints, are they now linear?
Dialogue: 0,00:47:03.860,00:47:06.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well, you know, because I've got,
Dialogue: 0,00:47:06.860,00:47:10.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,I put the x's inside the c functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:47:10.860,00:47:12.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So doesn't that make the problem linear?
Dialogue: 0,00:47:12.860,00:47:15.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,No, of course not.
Dialogue: 0,00:47:15.860,00:47:17.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,It may be a little more hidden,
Dialogue: 0,00:47:17.860,00:47:20.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,but they still have the products of weights times polynomials.
Dialogue: 0,00:47:20.860,00:47:22.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,They're just more complicated polynomials.
Dialogue: 0,00:47:22.860,00:47:25.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,If anything, it seems like it makes it harder.
Dialogue: 0,00:47:25.860,00:47:27.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because the original ones might have the,
Dialogue: 0,00:47:27.860,00:47:33.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,the Lth constraint had one weight times only a coefficient times x to the l.
Dialogue: 0,00:47:33.860,00:47:35.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,And now it's got all these other terms,
Dialogue: 0,00:47:35.860,00:47:37.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,the x to the l minus 1, the l minus 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:47:37.860,00:47:39.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,It seems like we're making it worse.
Dialogue: 0,00:47:39.860,00:47:42.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right, so,
Dialogue: 0,00:47:42.860,00:47:46.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,if we have these orthogonal polynomials,
Dialogue: 0,00:47:46.860,00:47:50.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and this notion of orthogonal for polynomials is,
Dialogue: 0,00:47:50.860,00:47:52.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,we say, that inner product of,
Dialogue: 0,00:47:52.860,00:47:54.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,of two polynomials is equal to zero,
Dialogue: 0,00:47:54.860,00:47:56.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,if they're of different order.
Dialogue: 0,00:47:56.860,00:48:00.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we sometimes use this inner product notation,
Dialogue: 0,00:48:00.860,00:48:04.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,or we use rectangular brackets, or,
Dialogue: 0,00:48:04.860,00:48:06.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,but it's the same idea as taking two vectors
Dialogue: 0,00:48:06.860,00:48:08.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and looking at their inner product.
Dialogue: 0,00:48:08.860,00:48:11.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if we sampled the polynomials and constructed the vectors that way,
Dialogue: 0,00:48:11.860,00:48:14.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,it would turn out to be identically the same thing.
Dialogue: 0,00:48:14.860,00:48:17.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or, you know, if we did this by quadrature,
Dialogue: 0,00:48:17.860,00:48:19.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,well, we'll get to that.
Dialogue: 0,00:48:19.860,00:48:21.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So,
Dialogue: 0,00:48:21.860,00:48:25.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,imagine now we do the following.
Dialogue: 0,00:48:25.860,00:48:28.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,We rewrite the exactness constraints,
Dialogue: 0,00:48:28.860,00:48:30.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we do it for the first half of the terms,
Dialogue: 0,00:48:30.860,00:48:32.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,what we'll call the lower terms,
Dialogue: 0,00:48:32.860,00:48:34.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,from zero to n minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:48:34.860,00:48:38.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,We'll write those in terms of these n minus 1 orthogonal polynomials.
Dialogue: 0,00:48:38.860,00:48:40.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then for the higher terms,
Dialogue: 0,00:48:40.860,00:48:43.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,we're going to write them a little bit differently.
Dialogue: 0,00:48:43.860,00:48:49.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,These are the terms that have to do with cn through c to the 2n minus 1 polynomial.
Dialogue: 0,00:48:49.860,00:48:50.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we've got the lower terms,
Dialogue: 0,00:48:50.860,00:48:52.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,from zero to n minus 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:48:52.860,00:48:53.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,the higher terms,
Dialogue: 0,00:48:53.860,00:48:55.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,from n to 2n minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:48:55.860,00:48:59.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we're just breaking them in half.
Dialogue: 0,00:48:59.860,00:49:01.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now these higher order terms,
Dialogue: 0,00:49:01.860,00:49:05.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,we don't have to generate these additional polynomials,
Dialogue: 0,00:49:05.860,00:49:08.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,the nth order and the 2n minus 1 order polynomial.

Dialogue: 0,00:57:39.860,00:57:41.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,glib. It's the, what we've
Dialogue: 0,00:57:41.860,00:57:43.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,done is to turn our problem of calculating

Dialogue: 0,00:57:53.860,00:57:55.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,But the non-linear problem hasn't gone away.
Dialogue: 0,00:57:55.860,00:57:57.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,It just means
Dialogue: 0,00:57:57.860,00:57:59.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,that we have turned it into one
Dialogue: 0,00:57:59.860,00:58:01.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,for which there is already a lot of work

Dialogue: 0,00:58:07.860,00:58:09.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,used it in this case.
Dialogue: 0,00:58:09.860,00:58:11.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we haven't taken the non-linear

Dialogue: 0,00:58:13.860,00:58:15.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,We have just decomposed them.
Dialogue: 0,00:58:15.860,00:58:17.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have this non-linear part of the problem
Dialogue: 0,00:58:17.860,00:58:19.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,is encapsulated with polynomial roots
Dialogue: 0,00:58:19.860,00:58:21.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then we have a linear solve.
Dialogue: 0,00:58:21.860,00:58:23.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is it possible that that has complex
Dialogue: 0,00:58:23.860,00:58:25.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,roots or would you instruct

Dialogue: 0,00:58:27.860,00:58:29.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the orthogonal polynomials,
Dialogue: 0,00:58:29.860,00:58:31.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,you have to have ones for which the roots

Dialogue: 0,00:58:33.860,00:58:35.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,That is an issue.
Dialogue: 0,00:58:35.860,00:58:37.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,And if you use polynomials that are orthogonal
Dialogue: 0,00:58:37.860,00:58:39.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,over say
Dialogue: 0,00:58:39.860,00:58:41.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,an integral from minus one to one,
Dialogue: 0,00:58:41.860,00:58:43.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,like the Chebyshev polynomials, those roots are always real.
Dialogue: 0,00:58:43.860,00:58:45.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,But yeah,
Dialogue: 0,00:58:45.860,00:58:47.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,the orthogonal polynomial.
Dialogue: 0,00:58:47.860,00:58:49.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,There are some ways in which when you

Dialogue: 0,00:58:51.860,00:58:53.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,you can guarantee that they're real roots.
Dialogue: 0,00:58:53.860,00:58:55.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,But that's the idea.
Dialogue: 0,00:58:55.860,00:58:57.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,We're going to construct these n plus one orthogonal polynomials.
Dialogue: 0,00:58:57.860,00:58:59.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,We're going to compute the roots of the nth

Dialogue: 0,00:59:03.860,00:59:05.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,We'll solve the linear system for the weights
Dialogue: 0,00:59:05.860,00:59:07.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then we'll approximate the integral as the sum.
Dialogue: 0,00:59:07.860,00:59:09.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So
Dialogue: 0,00:59:09.860,00:59:11.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's a great method
Dialogue: 0,00:59:11.860,00:59:13.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and you have a lot of degrees of freedom
Dialogue: 0,00:59:13.860,00:59:15.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,about how you do the orthogonal polynomials
Dialogue: 0,00:59:15.860,00:59:17.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,because we use just one definition of orthogonality.
Dialogue: 0,00:59:17.860,00:59:19.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,But you can come up with all sorts of different schemes
Dialogue: 0,00:59:19.860,00:59:21.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,by changing what we mean by an orthogonal polynomial.
Dialogue: 0,00:59:21.860,00:59:23.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that says the inner product of two polynomials
Dialogue: 0,00:59:23.860,00:59:25.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,integrated over the integral is zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:59:25.860,00:59:27.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,We could pick different intervals.
Dialogue: 0,00:59:27.860,00:59:29.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,We could pick a weighting function
Dialogue: 0,00:59:29.860,00:59:31.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,that sits in the middle of it.
Dialogue: 0,00:59:31.860,00:59:33.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then we can say
Dialogue: 0,00:59:33.860,00:59:35.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,that the integral is zero.
Dialogue: 0,00:59:35.860,00:59:37.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's the idea.
Dialogue: 0,00:59:37.860,00:59:39.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's the idea.
Dialogue: 0,00:59:39.860,00:59:41.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,And you get things like Gauss-Lobato,
Dialogue: 0,00:59:41.860,00:59:43.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Gauss-Chebyshev,
Dialogue: 0,00:59:43.860,00:59:45.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Gauss-Legendre, all these different ones
Dialogue: 0,00:59:45.860,00:59:47.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,that have to do with different intervals
Dialogue: 0,00:59:47.860,00:59:49.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and different representations
Dialogue: 0,00:59:49.860,00:59:51.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,of the inner product.
Dialogue: 0,00:59:51.860,00:59:53.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,But they all come down to the same thing.
Dialogue: 0,00:59:53.860,00:59:55.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,You have to find the roots of the orthogonal polynomials
Dialogue: 0,00:59:55.860,00:59:57.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,but you get to play with what orthogonality is.
Dialogue: 0,00:59:57.860,00:59:59.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or to come up with a weighted orthogonality.
Dialogue: 0,00:59:59.860,01:00:01.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or to come up with a weighted orthogonality.
Dialogue: 0,01:00:01.860,01:00:03.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or to come up with a weighted orthogonality.
Dialogue: 0,01:00:03.860,01:00:05.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So an endpoint

Dialogue: 0,01:00:11.860,01:00:13.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that means the thing goes
Dialogue: 0,01:00:13.860,01:00:15.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,what we refer to as spectrally accurate.
Dialogue: 0,01:00:15.860,01:00:17.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that's how you get the meaning
Dialogue: 0,01:00:17.860,01:00:19.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,that is you add more points.
Dialogue: 0,01:00:19.860,01:00:21.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,If we're looking at something like

Dialogue: 0,01:00:35.860,01:00:37.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or four times the reduction of the error.
Dialogue: 0,01:00:37.860,01:00:39.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,But these methods are

Dialogue: 0,01:00:41.860,01:00:43.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now we come back to the point I put up

Dialogue: 0,01:01:01.860,01:01:03.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I just remind you
Dialogue: 0,01:01:03.860,01:01:05.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,that with 11 points
Dialogue: 0,01:01:05.860,01:01:07.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,you can get machine precision out of these methods.
Dialogue: 0,01:01:07.860,01:01:09.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,And you can almost see that each time

Dialogue: 0,01:01:11.860,01:01:13.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,you get errors that

Dialogue: 0,01:01:15.860,01:01:17.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's the characteristic

Dialogue: 0,01:01:19.860,01:01:21.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So any linear accuracy will give you

Dialogue: 0,01:01:23.860,01:01:25.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and spectral accuracy means it's going down.
Dialogue: 0,01:01:25.860,01:01:27.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So it's going even faster than a straight line.

Dialogue: 0,01:01:31.860,01:01:33.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then another thing to look at is
Dialogue: 0,01:01:33.860,01:01:35.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,well suppose we took this interval

Dialogue: 0,01:01:37.860,01:01:39.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and looked to see where the simple Poitier points are

Dialogue: 0,01:01:41.860,01:01:43.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,versus the Gauss-Claude points.
Dialogue: 0,01:01:43.860,01:01:45.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,You can look at it and say

Dialogue: 0,01:01:47.860,01:01:49.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,But they are.
Dialogue: 0,01:01:49.860,01:01:51.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,You can see, and this is what's characteristic

Dialogue: 0,01:01:53.860,01:01:55.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,notice they're squeezed together at the ends

Dialogue: 0,01:01:59.860,01:02:01.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So
Dialogue: 0,01:02:01.860,01:02:03.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's a small, it looks like a small thing
Dialogue: 0,01:02:03.860,01:02:05.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean you're moving them around
Dialogue: 0,01:02:05.860,01:02:07.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the weights are

Dialogue: 0,01:02:21.860,01:02:23.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you are then midpoint rule is fine.

Dialogue: 0,01:02:29.860,01:02:31.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and even small changes
Dialogue: 0,01:02:31.860,01:02:33.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,like this point placement

Dialogue: 0,01:02:35.860,01:02:37.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright, so

Dialogue: 0,01:02:39.860,01:02:41.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we talked about this Gauss quadrature scheme

Dialogue: 0,01:02:59.860,01:03:01.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So remember what our problem was
Dialogue: 0,01:03:01.860,01:03:03.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,for a panel method.
Dialogue: 0,01:03:03.860,01:03:05.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,We're calculating these panels
Dialogue: 0,01:03:05.860,01:03:07.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,under which we're going to assume a constant density
Dialogue: 0,01:03:07.860,01:03:09.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and if we're doing a collocation method
Dialogue: 0,01:03:09.860,01:03:11.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,or a Lurkin method
Dialogue: 0,01:03:11.860,01:03:13.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,we have to calculate these integrals
Dialogue: 0,01:03:13.860,01:03:15.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,of one over distance over this panel
Dialogue: 0,01:03:15.860,01:03:17.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,for a point on the panel
Dialogue: 0,01:03:17.860,01:03:19.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,which means somewhere in that panel
Dialogue: 0,01:03:19.860,01:03:21.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,the integrand goes to infinity.
Dialogue: 0,01:03:21.860,01:03:23.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is what's called a singular integral.
Dialogue: 0,01:03:23.860,01:03:25.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we knew from last time
Dialogue: 0,01:03:25.860,01:03:27.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,we knew it was an integral singularity
Dialogue: 0,01:03:27.860,01:03:29.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we did that by carving out a disc out of it
Dialogue: 0,01:03:29.860,01:03:31.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,to prove it.
Dialogue: 0,01:03:31.860,01:03:33.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,But for this problem
Dialogue: 0,01:03:33.860,01:03:35.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,those quadrature schemes aren't going to happen.
Dialogue: 0,01:03:35.860,01:03:37.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So
Dialogue: 0,01:03:37.860,01:03:39.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I want to
Dialogue: 0,01:03:39.860,01:03:41.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,show you what happens here.
Dialogue: 0,01:03:41.860,01:03:43.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if we do something like one over the
Dialogue: 0,01:03:43.860,01:03:45.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,square root of the absolute value of x
Dialogue: 0,01:03:45.860,01:03:47.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and try to do a quadrature scheme
Dialogue: 0,01:03:47.860,01:03:49.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,as long as we keep away from the
Dialogue: 0,01:03:49.860,01:03:51.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,quadrature points
Dialogue: 0,01:03:51.860,01:03:53.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,at exactly x equals 0
Dialogue: 0,01:03:53.860,01:03:55.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,we can still formally do the quadrature
Dialogue: 0,01:03:55.860,01:03:57.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,no points at x equals 0
Dialogue: 0,01:03:57.860,01:03:59.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,so we have to pick up a polynomial
Dialogue: 0,01:03:59.860,01:04:01.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,that gives us for whom the root is not 0.
Dialogue: 0,01:04:03.860,01:04:05.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,But we don't get very good convergence
Dialogue: 0,01:04:05.860,01:04:07.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,that is
Dialogue: 0,01:04:07.860,01:04:09.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the reason we don't is this thing goes off
Dialogue: 0,01:04:09.860,01:04:11.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we don't get infinity.
Dialogue: 0,01:04:11.860,01:04:13.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,But I want to make a point about the difference
Dialogue: 0,01:04:13.860,01:04:15.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,between two types of infinity.
Dialogue: 0,01:04:15.860,01:04:17.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So there's one over the square root of the absolute value of x
Dialogue: 0,01:04:17.860,01:04:19.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,versus one over x.
Dialogue: 0,01:04:19.860,01:04:21.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the one over the square root
Dialogue: 0,01:04:21.860,01:04:23.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,of the absolute value of x
Dialogue: 0,01:04:23.860,01:04:25.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,that is an integrable singularity.
Dialogue: 0,01:04:25.860,01:04:27.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,The area under the curve is finite
Dialogue: 0,01:04:27.860,01:04:29.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,even though the integrand goes to infinity.
Dialogue: 0,01:04:29.860,01:04:31.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the one over x case
Dialogue: 0,01:04:31.860,01:04:33.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,in one dimension
Dialogue: 0,01:04:33.860,01:04:35.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,that goes to infinity.
Dialogue: 0,01:04:35.860,01:04:37.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now it doesn't go to infinity in two dimensions
Dialogue: 0,01:04:37.860,01:04:39.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,but it does in one dimension.
Dialogue: 0,01:04:39.860,01:04:43.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,There's no quadrature scheme
Dialogue: 0,01:04:43.860,01:04:45.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,that can give you
Dialogue: 0,01:04:45.860,01:04:47.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,that can solve this problem.
Dialogue: 0,01:04:47.860,01:04:49.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,If your integral is infinity
Dialogue: 0,01:04:49.860,01:04:51.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,here's your integral.
Dialogue: 0,01:04:51.860,01:04:53.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Infinity.
Dialogue: 0,01:04:53.860,01:04:55.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's it.
Dialogue: 0,01:04:55.860,01:04:57.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,If it has an integrable singularity
Dialogue: 0,01:04:57.860,01:04:59.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,then
Dialogue: 0,01:04:59.860,01:05:01.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,maybe a quadrature scheme would help you
Dialogue: 0,01:05:01.860,01:05:03.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,except what's true about that problem?
Dialogue: 0,01:05:05.860,01:05:07.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,When we started doing these quadrature error estimates
Dialogue: 0,01:05:07.860,01:05:09.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,what thing did we count on?
Dialogue: 0,01:05:09.860,01:05:11.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,In order to say something about the error.
Dialogue: 0,01:05:11.860,01:05:13.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,We used the
Dialogue: 0,01:05:13.860,01:05:15.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,remainder theorem for the Taylor series
Dialogue: 0,01:05:15.860,01:05:17.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,which counted on what about the derivatives?
Dialogue: 0,01:05:19.860,01:05:21.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Was the Taylor series expansion derivatives?
Dialogue: 0,01:05:21.860,01:05:23.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,01:05:23.860,01:05:25.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah but these
Dialogue: 0,01:05:25.860,01:05:27.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,the derivatives of the integrand
Dialogue: 0,01:05:27.860,01:05:29.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,are going to infinity.
Dialogue: 0,01:05:29.860,01:05:31.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,All those quadrature estimates of the error
Dialogue: 0,01:05:31.860,01:05:33.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,they're pretty much worthless here.
Dialogue: 0,01:05:33.860,01:05:35.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So
Dialogue: 0,01:05:35.860,01:05:37.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,you might think well okay
Dialogue: 0,01:05:37.860,01:05:39.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,we spent a class on these quadrature schemes
Dialogue: 0,01:05:39.860,01:05:41.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then at the end of the class I tell you
Dialogue: 0,01:05:41.860,01:05:43.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,for the integrals you most likely see
Dialogue: 0,01:05:43.860,01:05:45.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,when you're doing these integral equation methods
Dialogue: 0,01:05:45.860,01:05:47.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,you can't use these schemes.
Dialogue: 0,01:05:47.860,01:05:49.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well that's not entirely true
Dialogue: 0,01:05:49.860,01:05:51.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,because there's only one panel
Dialogue: 0,01:05:51.860,01:05:53.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,you have to worry about.
Dialogue: 0,01:05:53.860,01:05:55.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,The panel with the test point on the panel.
Dialogue: 0,01:05:55.860,01:05:57.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,All the other panels that interact with this panel
Dialogue: 0,01:05:57.860,01:05:59.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,you can do those with quadrature
Dialogue: 0,01:05:59.860,01:06:01.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and it works great there.
Dialogue: 0,01:06:01.860,01:06:03.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if I have a discretization with n panels
Dialogue: 0,01:06:03.860,01:06:05.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,then I've got to do n squared interactions
Dialogue: 0,01:06:05.860,01:06:07.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and only order n of them
Dialogue: 0,01:06:07.860,01:06:09.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,is problematic.
Dialogue: 0,01:06:09.860,01:06:11.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you can do Gauss quadrature
Dialogue: 0,01:06:11.860,01:06:13.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and do a great job of n squared minus n
Dialogue: 0,01:06:13.860,01:06:15.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,of the panels and the n panels that you can't do that with
Dialogue: 0,01:06:15.860,01:06:17.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,you have to do something else.
Dialogue: 0,01:06:17.860,01:06:19.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So
Dialogue: 0,01:06:19.860,01:06:21.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,I told you something. So if n is very large
Dialogue: 0,01:06:21.860,01:06:23.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,like a thousand
Dialogue: 0,01:06:23.860,01:06:25.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,then n squared is a million
Dialogue: 0,01:06:25.860,01:06:27.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and n squared minus n is almost a million.
Dialogue: 0,01:06:27.860,01:06:29.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm telling you something that works better than
Dialogue: 0,01:06:29.860,01:06:31.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,99% of the time
Dialogue: 0,01:06:31.860,01:06:33.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and that should be good enough.
Dialogue: 0,01:06:33.860,01:06:35.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,But of course if you have to solve these problems
Dialogue: 0,01:06:35.860,01:06:37.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,they're still stuck with what to do for the self-charge.
Dialogue: 0,01:06:37.860,01:06:39.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So
Dialogue: 0,01:06:39.860,01:06:41.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,the problem is that
Dialogue: 0,01:06:41.860,01:06:43.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,simple quadrature done on these
Dialogue: 0,01:06:43.860,01:06:45.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,problems that have singular
Dialogue: 0,01:06:45.860,01:06:47.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,integrands are usually better than
Dialogue: 0,01:06:47.860,01:06:49.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Gauss quadrature.
Dialogue: 0,01:06:49.860,01:06:51.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Doing the special placement of points and weights
Dialogue: 0,01:06:51.860,01:06:53.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,doesn't help you at all in setting.
Dialogue: 0,01:06:53.860,01:06:55.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,You need to do something else.
Dialogue: 0,01:06:55.860,01:06:57.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to take a little time
Dialogue: 0,01:06:57.860,01:06:59.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,at the end and I'm going to talk a little bit about what people do
Dialogue: 0,01:06:59.860,01:07:01.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,now.
Dialogue: 0,01:07:01.860,01:07:03.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,I want to show you some of the
Dialogue: 0,01:07:03.860,01:07:05.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,standard things people try.
Dialogue: 0,01:07:05.860,01:07:07.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So here's one way of dealing with the problem.
Dialogue: 0,01:07:07.860,01:07:09.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,You say, okay, well, look, I can do Gauss quadrature
Dialogue: 0,01:07:09.860,01:07:11.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,so if I imagine I have a panel
Dialogue: 0,01:07:11.860,01:07:13.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I want to
Dialogue: 0,01:07:13.860,01:07:15.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,so
Dialogue: 0,01:07:15.860,01:07:17.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,so imagine
Dialogue: 0,01:07:17.860,01:07:19.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,this is my panel and I want to integrate
Dialogue: 0,01:07:19.860,01:07:21.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,1 over r and the problem is that
Dialogue: 0,01:07:21.860,01:07:23.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,the 1 over r, the 1 over distance on the panel
Dialogue: 0,01:07:23.860,01:07:25.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,it goes to infinity at the center.
Dialogue: 0,01:07:25.860,01:07:27.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to do my
Dialogue: 0,01:07:27.860,01:07:29.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Gauss quadrature scheme
Dialogue: 0,01:07:31.860,01:07:33.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,on this region
Dialogue: 0,01:07:33.860,01:07:35.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then
Dialogue: 0,01:07:35.860,01:07:37.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'll do something else in the interior.
Dialogue: 0,01:07:37.860,01:07:39.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I might, you know, because it's hard
Dialogue: 0,01:07:39.860,01:07:41.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,to do this region, I could

Dialogue: 0,01:07:43.860,01:07:45.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,so it has, you know,
Dialogue: 0,01:07:45.860,01:07:47.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,the geometry is nice and I can do
Dialogue: 0,01:07:47.860,01:07:49.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Gauss quadrature on these nice square integrals
Dialogue: 0,01:07:49.860,01:07:51.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,where it's
Dialogue: 0,01:07:51.860,01:07:53.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,easy to do so.
Dialogue: 0,01:07:53.860,01:07:55.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, alright, that's
Dialogue: 0,01:07:55.860,01:07:57.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,better. I just have to pull out
Dialogue: 0,01:07:57.860,01:07:59.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,I just have to figure out what to do with this little square in the center
Dialogue: 0,01:07:59.860,01:08:01.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I say, well,
Dialogue: 0,01:08:01.860,01:08:03.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,okay, but I haven't removed the problem.
Dialogue: 0,01:08:03.860,01:08:05.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,I just figured, well, look,
Dialogue: 0,01:08:05.860,01:08:07.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's a much smaller contribution to the integral
Dialogue: 0,01:08:07.860,01:08:09.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,so if I screw it up, it won't have as bad
Dialogue: 0,01:08:09.860,01:08:11.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,an impact. You say, well, okay,
Dialogue: 0,01:08:11.860,01:08:13.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,but you're still screwing it up.
Dialogue: 0,01:08:13.860,01:08:15.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you take this one
Dialogue: 0,01:08:15.860,01:08:17.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and you say, alright, well, I blow
Dialogue: 0,01:08:17.860,01:08:19.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,this square up into another square and I take
Dialogue: 0,01:08:19.860,01:08:21.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,out a little piece. So I start by
Dialogue: 0,01:08:21.860,01:08:23.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,taking out one piece and then I
Dialogue: 0,01:08:23.860,01:08:25.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,go inside and take out another piece
Dialogue: 0,01:08:25.860,01:08:27.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and another piece. You do that
Dialogue: 0,01:08:27.860,01:08:29.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,a few times. These are sometimes
Dialogue: 0,01:08:29.860,01:08:31.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,called refinement strategies.
Dialogue: 0,01:08:31.860,01:08:33.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So people do this kind of thing where they

Dialogue: 0,01:10:53.860,01:10:55.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,the idea is to come up with

Dialogue: 0,01:10:57.860,01:10:59.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we're going to come up with

Dialogue: 0,01:11:41.860,01:11:43.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we're going to take this function
Dialogue: 0,01:11:43.860,01:11:45.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we're going to try to

Dialogue: 0,01:14:43.860,01:14:45.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,I don't care about the tails anymore.
Dialogue: 0,01:14:53.860,01:14:55.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then you just
Dialogue: 0,01:14:55.860,01:14:57.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,put points in.
Dialogue: 0,01:14:57.860,01:14:59.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,And it turns out you can actually use equally spaced methods
Dialogue: 0,01:14:59.860,01:15:01.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,for reasons I'm not going to go into.
Dialogue: 0,01:15:01.860,01:15:03.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,When you just put points down
Dialogue: 0,01:15:03.860,01:15:05.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,you figure out how much
Dialogue: 0,01:15:05.860,01:15:07.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,of the tail you're willing to ignore
Dialogue: 0,01:15:07.860,01:15:09.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and what kind of procedure you need.
Dialogue: 0,01:15:09.860,01:15:11.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then you spread equally spaced points
Dialogue: 0,01:15:11.860,01:15:13.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,over the rest of the interval
Dialogue: 0,01:15:13.860,01:15:15.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,or you do your Gauss-Cogitore points
Dialogue: 0,01:15:15.860,01:15:17.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and do whatever you want in that interval
Dialogue: 0,01:15:17.860,01:15:19.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,because in this interval
Dialogue: 0,01:15:19.860,01:15:21.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,everything's smooth.
Dialogue: 0,01:15:21.860,01:15:23.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Nothing goes to infinity.
Dialogue: 0,01:15:23.860,01:15:25.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,And you might think, how could that possibly
Dialogue: 0,01:15:25.860,01:15:27.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,be the best way of doing it?
Dialogue: 0,01:15:27.860,01:15:29.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,And it turns out
Dialogue: 0,01:15:29.860,01:15:31.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,when you try all these schemes
Dialogue: 0,01:15:31.860,01:15:33.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,for putting down points and weights
Dialogue: 0,01:15:33.860,01:15:35.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,the best thing to do is to come up with
Dialogue: 0,01:15:35.860,01:15:37.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,things that are infinitely differentiable.
Dialogue: 0,01:15:37.860,01:15:39.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Things like e to the minus t squared
Dialogue: 0,01:15:39.860,01:15:41.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,the error function
Dialogue: 0,01:15:41.860,01:15:43.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,or that's the derivative of the error function
Dialogue: 0,01:15:43.860,01:15:45.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,or hyperbolic sines, cosines, and tangents
Dialogue: 0,01:15:45.860,01:15:47.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,you can use to construct these things.
Dialogue: 0,01:15:47.860,01:15:49.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that's what most of the good quadruped schemes
Dialogue: 0,01:15:49.860,01:15:51.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,to deal with the singularity are.
Dialogue: 0,01:15:51.860,01:15:53.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,It seems very counterintuitive at the beginning
Dialogue: 0,01:15:53.860,01:15:55.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is why only recently
Dialogue: 0,01:15:55.860,01:15:57.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,it has become popular
Dialogue: 0,01:15:57.860,01:15:59.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,because you think, how could that be the right way to do it?
Dialogue: 0,01:15:59.860,01:16:01.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,But when you're done you end up with
Dialogue: 0,01:16:01.860,01:16:03.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,methods that use a few dozen points
Dialogue: 0,01:16:03.860,01:16:05.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and you do these singular integrals
Dialogue: 0,01:16:05.860,01:16:07.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and you can do it very visually.
Dialogue: 0,01:16:07.860,01:16:09.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, my sorry, it looked like you had a question.
Dialogue: 0,01:16:09.860,01:16:11.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,No, no, no, I'll correct you.
Dialogue: 0,01:16:11.860,01:16:13.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, I'm going to stop there.
Dialogue: 0,01:16:13.860,01:16:15.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,I wanted to sort of throw this in at the end
Dialogue: 0,01:16:15.860,01:16:17.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,because it's only in the last few years
Dialogue: 0,01:16:17.860,01:16:19.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,that these methods have started to become popular
Dialogue: 0,01:16:19.860,01:16:21.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I'm afraid, you know, I fell into that same category
Dialogue: 0,01:16:21.860,01:16:23.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,of people who said, no, come on
Dialogue: 0,01:16:23.860,01:16:25.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,we're not really going to take an integral from 0 to 1
Dialogue: 0,01:16:25.860,01:16:27.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and turn it into 1 from minus infinity to infinity
Dialogue: 0,01:16:27.860,01:16:29.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,that can't be a good idea
Dialogue: 0,01:16:29.860,01:16:31.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,but as people have gone through
Dialogue: 0,01:16:31.860,01:16:33.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and made practical implementations of these methods
Dialogue: 0,01:16:33.860,01:16:35.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and you look at the number of points in which
Dialogue: 0,01:16:35.860,01:16:37.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,they have to use and how generally they can be developed
Dialogue: 0,01:16:37.860,01:16:39.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,you find that they're
Dialogue: 0,01:16:39.860,01:16:41.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,quite effective methods
Dialogue: 0,01:16:41.860,01:16:43.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and they're now good pieces of software
Dialogue: 0,01:16:43.860,01:16:45.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,that can do these kinds of transformations
Dialogue: 0,01:16:45.860,01:16:47.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and let you do singular integrals
Dialogue: 0,01:16:47.860,01:16:49.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,though you do have to arrange
Dialogue: 0,01:16:49.860,01:16:51.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,to put the point where the singularity is
Dialogue: 0,01:16:51.860,01:16:53.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,at the end of your integral
Dialogue: 0,01:16:53.860,01:16:55.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,so if we have a panel
Dialogue: 0,01:16:55.860,01:16:57.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we have a singularity in the center
Dialogue: 0,01:16:57.860,01:16:59.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,we've got to break it up into four panels
Dialogue: 0,01:16:59.860,01:17:01.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,so that the singularity can be at the corner
Dialogue: 0,01:17:01.860,01:17:03.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,so there's some issues
Dialogue: 0,01:17:03.860,01:17:05.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,I wanted to at least show you this
Dialogue: 0,01:17:05.860,01:17:07.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,in one of the papers that gives a good survey
Dialogue: 0,01:17:07.860,01:17:09.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,of these kinds of methods and pointers to software
Dialogue: 0,01:17:09.860,01:17:11.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,so you can see
Dialogue: 0,01:17:11.860,01:17:13.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,but I wanted to show you at least at the end of this
Dialogue: 0,01:17:13.860,01:17:15.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,that there are ways of dealing with singular integrals
Dialogue: 0,01:17:15.860,01:17:17.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,but what we're going to do next time
Dialogue: 0,01:17:17.860,01:17:19.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,is look at problems to which we don't get singular integrals
Dialogue: 0,01:17:19.860,01:17:21.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we'll do that next time
Dialogue: 0,01:17:21.860,01:17:23.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,but for this I just wanted to show you
Dialogue: 0,01:17:23.860,01:17:25.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,what's the most modern thing
Dialogue: 0,01:17:25.860,01:17:27.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,even if we did it vaguely at the end
Dialogue: 0,01:17:27.860,01:17:29.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,the big thing to remember about orthogonal polynomials
Dialogue: 0,01:17:29.860,01:17:31.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and this idea of points and weights
Dialogue: 0,01:17:31.860,01:17:33.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,where the points are coming from a polynomial
Dialogue: 0,01:17:33.860,01:17:35.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,the zeros of a polynomial
Dialogue: 0,01:17:35.860,01:17:37.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the weights are coming from solving a linear system
Dialogue: 0,01:17:37.860,01:17:39.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,these are very powerful techniques
Dialogue: 0,01:17:39.860,01:17:41.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,you can often construct very effective
Dialogue: 0,01:17:41.860,01:17:43.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,quadrature schemes for yourself
Dialogue: 0,01:17:43.860,01:17:45.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,by determining what's a good set of polynomials
Dialogue: 0,01:17:45.860,01:17:47.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,to use for your own problem
Dialogue: 0,01:17:47.860,01:17:49.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and as we'll see next time
Dialogue: 0,01:17:49.860,01:17:51.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,it also helps you design very good methods
Dialogue: 0,01:17:51.860,01:17:53.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,for solving integral equations in 2D
Dialogue: 0,01:17:53.860,01:17:55.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,on closed-circuit boundaries
Dialogue: 0,01:17:55.860,01:17:57.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,alright
Dialogue: 0,01:17:57.860,01:17:59.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,what I didn't talk about is multiple dimensions
Dialogue: 0,01:17:59.860,01:18:01.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and I wasn't going to say too much about that
Dialogue: 0,01:18:01.860,01:18:03.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,because we won't be talking about that
Dialogue: 0,01:18:03.860,01:18:05.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,but I wanted to show you a few things
Dialogue: 0,01:18:05.860,01:18:07.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm not doing much with that next time
Dialogue: 0,01:18:07.860,01:18:09.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,but if you ask I'll talk about it a little bit
Dialogue: 0,01:18:09.860,01:18:13.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,maybe towards the end of this last week of the term
Dialogue: 0,01:18:13.860,01:18:15.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,so let me stop there
Dialogue: 0,01:18:15.860,01:18:17.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,the video I know I'm late on
Dialogue: 0,01:18:17.860,01:18:19.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,should be up by tomorrow I think
Dialogue: 0,01:18:19.860,01:18:21.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,for the class class
Dialogue: 0,01:18:21.860,01:18:23.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and will be up for this class hopefully
Dialogue: 0,01:18:23.860,01:18:25.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,the day after that
Dialogue: 0,01:18:25.860,01:18:27.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and there will be a problem set that will be posted
Dialogue: 0,01:18:27.860,01:18:29.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we're negotiating about what times
Dialogue: 0,01:18:29.860,01:18:31.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,to do these evening problem set sessions
Dialogue: 0,01:18:31.860,01:18:33.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,but you should come to one or the other of them
Dialogue: 0,01:18:33.860,01:18:35.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and plan on starting
Dialogue: 0,01:18:35.860,01:18:37.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and finishing the problem set
Dialogue: 0,01:18:37.860,01:18:39.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,in that session
Dialogue: 0,01:18:39.860,01:18:41.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,this is not supposed to be
Dialogue: 0,01:18:41.860,01:18:43.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's supposed to be a chance for you to try working on a problem
Dialogue: 0,01:18:43.860,01:18:45.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,that gives you an idea of how to use these methods
Dialogue: 0,01:18:45.860,01:18:47.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,not to
Dialogue: 0,01:18:47.860,01:18:49.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,then make sure that you sort of have a sense
Dialogue: 0,01:18:49.860,01:18:51.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,of where the material is
Dialogue: 0,01:18:51.860,01:18:53.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,we just didn't have enough time in this last part of the course
Dialogue: 0,01:18:53.860,01:18:55.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,to give you the opportunity
Dialogue: 0,01:18:55.860,01:18:57.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,to sort of let it sink in
Dialogue: 0,01:18:57.860,01:18:59.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,so we can do something
Dialogue: 0,01:18:59.860,01:19:01.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,we want you to see actual practical calculations
Dialogue: 0,01:19:01.860,01:19:03.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,but we don't have enough time
Dialogue: 0,01:19:03.860,01:19:05.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,we can't give you enough time to actually think this through
Dialogue: 0,01:19:05.860,01:19:07.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and we're just going to be
Dialogue: 0,01:19:07.860,01:19:09.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,thinking about the problem set when it comes out
Dialogue: 0,01:19:09.860,01:19:11.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,think about coming to one of these sessions
Dialogue: 0,01:19:11.860,01:19:13.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think you'll find it's a good experience
Dialogue: 0,01:19:13.860,01:19:15.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and if you try to do it on your own
Dialogue: 0,01:19:15.860,01:19:17.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,there are probably things that you needed to know
Dialogue: 0,01:19:17.860,01:19:19.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,that we haven't told you
Dialogue: 0,01:19:19.860,01:19:21.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,or we assumed you knew
Dialogue: 0,01:19:21.860,01:19:23.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,that having come to the evening lecture
Dialogue: 0,01:19:23.860,01:19:25.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,would have saved you from frustration
Dialogue: 0,01:19:25.860,01:19:27.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,so please as you're thinking about that
Dialogue: 0,01:19:27.860,01:19:29.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then I think we're going to use the last couple of minutes
Dialogue: 0,01:19:29.860,01:19:31.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think Professor Wang will talk a little bit about the
Dialogue: 0,01:19:31.860,01:19:33.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,the project
Dialogue: 0,01:19:33.860,01:19:35.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,so I'm going to hand it over to you
Dialogue: 0,01:19:35.860,01:19:37.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,and then we'll get to the video in a little bit
Dialogue: 0,01:19:37.860,01:19:42.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,yeah so I think this is the one content we have
