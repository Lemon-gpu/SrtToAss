Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:07.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,What's remarkable is the same thing applies for PDs.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:07.000,00:00:17.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So remember, we have a differential operator discretized in both space and time.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:17.000,00:00:33.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's say this is going to be replacing my time derivative here.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:33.000,00:00:37.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is discretized using forward Euler.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:37.000,00:00:41.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And my right hand side is still the same.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:41.000,00:00:43.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Delta x squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:43.000,00:00:47.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And because it's forward Euler, this is u k.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:47.000,00:00:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,My right hand side is expressed as the differential operator operated on the known quantities.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:56.000,00:00:59.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or the quantity at the previous time step.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:59.000,00:01:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,If it's backward Euler, the whole right hand side would be k plus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:06.000,00:01:13.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now, I'm going to apply the same Fourier transform but still only in space.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:13.000,00:01:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because in time, we don't know if we can do that or not.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:16.000,00:01:17.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we still...
Dialogue: 0,00:01:17.000,00:01:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Only apply this in space.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:20.000,00:01:23.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, I think I messed up with my k.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:23.000,00:01:27.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let me don't use k plus 1 here. Sorry.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:27.000,00:01:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's use something like m.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:32.000,00:01:35.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, anyway.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:35.000,00:01:37.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the stability region.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:37.000,00:01:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's use m.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:42.000,00:01:43.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:43.000,00:01:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Once we use m, we can say that...
Dialogue: 0,00:01:46.000,00:01:55.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,u m of i is equal to summation of k goes from minus n over 2 because of aliasing.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:55.000,00:01:59.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I have u hat m of k.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:59.000,00:02:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now this u hat is not a function of continuous time but a function of m, the discrete time steps.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:06.000,00:02:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,u to the j k i delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:10.000,00:02:13.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Everything else is still the same.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:13.000,00:02:15.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So when we plug this in,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:15.000,00:02:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,the time derivative or the discrete time derivative is only applied to here.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:20.000,00:02:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So after doing the same thing we did before, we get...
Dialogue: 0,00:02:24.000,00:02:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,u hat of m k...
Dialogue: 0,00:02:28.000,00:02:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,k m plus 1 minus u hat of m k divided by delta t is equal to kappa times...
Dialogue: 0,00:02:38.000,00:02:43.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,my 2 cosine delta x minus k...
Dialogue: 0,00:02:43.000,00:02:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Sorry.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:44.000,00:02:53.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,k delta x minus 2 divided by delta x squared times u hat of m k.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:53.000,00:02:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:56.000,00:02:59.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now...
Dialogue: 0,00:02:59.000,00:03:00.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, sorry.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:00.000,00:03:02.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is delta t, not delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:02.000,00:03:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this comes from here.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:04.000,00:03:09.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,This comes from here.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:09.000,00:03:12.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, how can we analyze...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:12.000,00:03:13.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Can somebody tell me?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:13.000,00:03:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,In what cases is this equation stable?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:20.000,00:03:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,In what cases is the space-time discretization stable?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:25.000,00:03:27.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:27.000,00:03:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you look at the previous one, we are doing pretty much the same thing, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:32.000,00:03:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:34.000,00:03:39.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Except for we have something more complex over here.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:39.000,00:03:41.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:43.000,00:03:47.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Somebody tell me how do I analyze the stability of this PDE now,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:47.000,00:03:50.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,discrete in both space and time?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:50.000,00:03:53.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:53.000,00:03:55.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the same as our lambda, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:03:55.000,00:03:57.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we want to analyze that...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:57.000,00:04:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,We want to analyze 1 plus delta t times this kappa...
Dialogue: 0,00:04:04.000,00:04:09.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,2 cosine k delta x minus 2 over delta x squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:09.000,00:04:11.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,This thing has to be less than 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:11.000,00:04:13.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Less than 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:13.000,00:04:17.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:17.000,00:04:21.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,But what about the k here?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:21.000,00:04:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,There is still...
Dialogue: 0,00:04:22.000,00:04:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I cannot decide about this unless I know what k is.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:25.000,00:04:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:26.000,00:04:27.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So kappa is given.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:27.000,00:04:29.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Kappa is from the differential equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:29.000,00:04:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:30.000,00:04:35.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,But k is something we invented by doing the Fourier series.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:35.000,00:04:37.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So how do I deal with the k?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:37.000,00:04:39.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:39.000,00:04:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So...
Dialogue: 0,00:04:40.000,00:04:41.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's a good point.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:41.000,00:04:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Choose the worst case k.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:44.000,00:04:45.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:45.000,00:04:47.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's what you are saying, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:47.000,00:04:55.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in other words, this condition has to be valid for all k.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:55.000,00:05:01.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for all k that goes from n over 2 minus n over 2, etc.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:01.000,00:05:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,to n over 2 minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:04.000,00:05:05.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:05.000,00:05:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's actually the difficult part
Dialogue: 0,00:05:08.000,00:05:10.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,about making sure a...
Dialogue: 0,00:05:10.000,00:05:13.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,partial differential equation is stable.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:13.000,00:05:19.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,That is, you have a lot of different modes mixed in the Fourier series.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:19.000,00:05:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:20.000,00:05:21.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you have a...
Dialogue: 0,00:05:21.000,00:05:23.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's say if you have an initial condition.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:23.000,00:05:27.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The initial condition is usually not just containing a single Fourier mode.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:27.000,00:05:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It usually...
Dialogue: 0,00:05:28.000,00:05:31.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you use any function except for sine and cosine functions,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:31.000,00:05:35.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,almost any other function contains all the Fourier modes.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:35.000,00:05:37.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's just that the magnitude...
Dialogue: 0,00:05:37.000,00:05:39.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's basically a linear composition of many Fourier modes.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:39.000,00:05:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And as soon as one of your k is not stable,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:44.000,00:05:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,that component is going to be exponentially magnified
Dialogue: 0,00:05:48.000,00:05:51.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and make your whole solution garbage.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:53.000,00:05:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in analyzing stability of partial differential equations,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:56.000,00:05:59.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,you need to make sure that all the modes
Dialogue: 0,00:05:59.000,00:06:03.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,that can exist in the solution are stable.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:03.000,00:06:05.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:05.000,00:06:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And now let's figure out what this condition needs, actually.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:09.000,00:06:11.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:11.000,00:06:17.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's copy what we had in the last slide.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:17.000,00:06:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So delta t kappa delta x squared
Dialogue: 0,00:06:22.000,00:06:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,to cosine delta x times k minus 2
Dialogue: 0,00:06:25.000,00:06:29.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,has to be less than 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:29.000,00:06:33.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And now let's try to plot them
Dialogue: 0,00:06:33.000,00:06:35.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,as a function of...
Dialogue: 0,00:06:35.000,00:06:37.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Um...
Dialogue: 0,00:06:37.000,00:06:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's plot them as a function of k delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:42.000,00:06:45.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:45.000,00:06:47.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I remember...
Dialogue: 0,00:06:47.000,00:06:53.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's plot this as a function of k delta x.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:53.000,00:06:58.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I think let's use this here.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:58.000,00:07:01.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is...
Dialogue: 0,00:07:01.000,00:07:05.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's just plot this
Dialogue: 0,00:07:05.000,00:07:11.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,as this 2 cosine delta x k minus 2 here.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:11.000,00:07:16.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we know we need to multiply this thing by that.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:16.000,00:07:17.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:07:17.000,00:07:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's a constant.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:18.000,00:07:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's define this constant c
Dialogue: 0,00:07:20.000,00:07:24.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,as kappa delta t over delta x squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:24.000,00:07:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we're going to know later on
Dialogue: 0,00:07:26.000,00:07:29.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,this number is called the so-called CFL number.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:29.000,00:07:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this...
Dialogue: 0,00:07:32.000,00:07:33.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Ah...
Dialogue: 0,00:07:33.000,00:07:34.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Move this to here.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:35.000,00:07:37.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:37.000,00:07:39.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this function...
Dialogue: 0,00:07:39.000,00:07:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or this constant times this quantity plus 1
Dialogue: 0,00:07:44.000,00:07:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,is going to be the decision...
Dialogue: 0,00:07:46.000,00:07:49.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,deciding factor in the stability analysis.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:49.000,00:07:51.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's look at what this is.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:51.000,00:07:53.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And remember k delta x,
Dialogue: 0,00:07:53.000,00:08:01.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,because delta x is equal to 2 pi over n,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:01.000,00:08:03.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and k goes from minus...
Dialogue: 0,00:08:03.000,00:08:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,minus...
Dialogue: 0,00:08:04.000,00:08:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,n over 2 to n over 2 minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:08.000,00:08:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the range of k delta x is bounded between minus pi and pi.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:14.000,00:08:15.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:15.000,00:08:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:18.000,00:08:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now 2 of cosine minus 2.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:22.000,00:08:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,A cosine of k delta x ranges from 1 to minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:30.000,00:08:32.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So 2 times this minus 2...
Dialogue: 0,00:08:32.000,00:08:37.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or again, I can write it 2 times cosine minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:37.000,00:08:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is going to range from...
Dialogue: 0,00:08:40.000,00:08:43.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Basically the maximum is going to be 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:43.000,00:08:46.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The minimum is going to be...
Dialogue: 0,00:08:46.000,00:08:47.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,minus 4.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:47.000,00:08:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:48.000,00:08:52.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to have a function that looks like a cosine,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:52.000,00:08:54.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,but goes like that.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:54.000,00:08:58.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,And at the bottom, this is minus 4.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:58.000,00:09:01.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Which is equal to 2 times...

Dialogue: 0,00:09:33.000,00:09:35.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,with the CFL number,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:35.000,00:09:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and add by 1,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:38.000,00:09:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I want to make sure this number stays within the range of the circle.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:44.000,00:09:47.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The circle goes from minus 2 to 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:47.000,00:09:48.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean, also...
Dialogue: 0,00:09:48.000,00:09:51.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Also, this is always a real number, remember?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:51.000,00:09:55.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I want to make sure that the number lies within that range.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:55.000,00:09:59.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:59.000,00:10:03.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I want to make sure this number,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:03.000,00:10:09.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,which now I can write as 1 plus c,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:09.000,00:10:14.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,times something that ranges from minus 4 to 0,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:14.000,00:10:20.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,has to be less than 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:20.000,00:10:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, the less than...
Dialogue: 0,00:10:22.000,00:10:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we're taking the absolute value here, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:25.000,00:10:28.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that means, without the absolute value,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:28.000,00:10:31.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,it has to be less than 1 and greater than minus 1.

Dialogue: 0,00:10:34.000,00:10:36.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,because... as long as c is positive.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:36.000,00:10:38.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because the maximum of this number,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:38.000,00:10:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,2 times cosine delta x k minus 2,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:40.000,00:10:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,is going to be 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:42.000,00:10:49.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,But the greater than minus 1 part is not going to be automatically satisfied.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:49.000,00:10:53.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because when this takes the value of minus 4,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:53.000,00:10:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,my c has to be less than... what?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:58.000,00:11:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,c has to be...
Dialogue: 0,00:11:04.000,00:11:06.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,first, greater than 0,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:06.000,00:11:08.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,and less than what?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:08.000,00:11:12.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,For this to be greater than minus 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:12.000,00:11:15.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,It has to be less than half.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:15.000,00:11:18.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:18.000,00:11:22.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Make sense?
Dialogue: 0,00:11:22.000,00:11:26.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, this is called the CFL condition.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:26.000,00:11:35.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The c and f and l is just the first letter in the last name
Dialogue: 0,00:11:35.000,00:11:40.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,of three people who almost simultaneously discovered this law.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:40.000,00:11:42.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright, the CFL condition is...
Dialogue: 0,00:11:42.000,00:11:43.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let me write this down.
