Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:06.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So today we will be talking about equation based modeling using console physics.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:06.320,00:00:13.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,On Monday what you will see was a general introduction and using the built-in
Dialogue: 0,00:00:13.200,00:00:17.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,physics based interfaces to solve different physical problems but
Dialogue: 0,00:00:17.880,00:00:23.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,sometimes the models you want to solve might not be already built in into the
Dialogue: 0,00:00:23.400,00:00:27.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,software but you might have your ordinary differential equation or partial
Dialogue: 0,00:00:27.900,00:00:32.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,differential equation that models that process and so what we're talking about
Dialogue: 0,00:00:32.940,00:00:40.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,today is how to enter those equations and how to pick the appropriate
Dialogue: 0,00:00:40.320,00:00:47.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,interface and how to couple different PDs together if you have a couple of PDs
Dialogue: 0,00:00:47.640,00:00:55.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,system. My name is Tamis Sagan, you can call me Tami. I work in the console as an
Dialogue: 0,00:00:55.320,00:00:57.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,application engineer.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:57.000,00:00:57.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Primarily I work for Microsoft and I work for Microsoft and Microsoft is a
Dialogue: 0,00:00:57.900,00:01:01.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,traditional software development company that is primarily focused on
Dialogue: 0,00:01:01.040,00:01:05.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,structural mechanics and equation based modeling. So today we will be mostly
Dialogue: 0,00:01:05.660,00:01:14.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,talking about equation based model. Now, console under the hood is really a
Dialogue: 0,00:01:14.440,00:01:21.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,system for solving partial differential equations numerically. This can be linear
Dialogue: 0,00:01:21.440,00:01:27.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,equations, nonlinear equations, scatters, systems but the idea is if we build the
Dialogue: 0,00:01:27.000,00:01:35.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,if we build the infrastructure to solve an arbitrary system of PDEs or ODEs and algebraic
Dialogue: 0,00:01:35.720,00:01:42.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,equations then we would be able to handle a lot of problems that are encountered in science and
Dialogue: 0,00:01:42.840,00:01:50.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,engineering. Some other software sometimes start with solving a certain area saying okay we want
Dialogue: 0,00:01:50.360,00:01:55.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,to solve a heat transfer problem or we want to make a fluid flow or we want to make structural
Dialogue: 0,00:01:55.800,00:02:02.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,mechanics simulation package and the way we went about it is we want to make a PDE solver
Dialogue: 0,00:02:02.680,00:02:09.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,and an ODE solver and anything most problems coming down form anyway then you can handle
Dialogue: 0,00:02:09.240,00:02:16.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,them. So some of the more popular partial equations here the Maxwell equations at the bottom Navier-Stokes
Dialogue: 0,00:02:16.840,00:02:23.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,equation at the top heat transfer, chemical interaction engineering, acoustic, Schrodinger's equation, the
Dialogue: 0,00:02:23.800,00:02:25.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,elasticity equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:25.240,00:02:25.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,So
Dialogue: 0,00:02:25.800,00:02:36.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,the way this works then is under I mean on top of these PDEs we build physics based interfaces
Dialogue: 0,00:02:37.320,00:02:44.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,for structural mechanics or electrical chemical thermal fluid and whenever you are designing any
Dialogue: 0,00:02:44.840,00:02:50.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,device or analyzing most realistic problems there is going to be more than one of this
Dialogue: 0,00:02:50.920,00:02:53.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,involved. If you are doing fluid structure interaction
Dialogue: 0,00:02:53.960,00:03:01.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,you would need to couple structural mechanics with fluid flow. This happens often for example
Dialogue: 0,00:03:01.240,00:03:08.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,if you are doing biomechanics and you want to analyze flow in blood vessels and then also
Dialogue: 0,00:03:08.040,00:03:13.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,analyze stress in the arteries and couple that then you would need to do fluid structure
Dialogue: 0,00:03:13.480,00:03:19.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,interaction. Or if you have doing a chemical reaction problems where the reaction generates or
Dialogue: 0,00:03:21.640,00:03:22.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,consumes heat,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:23.960,00:03:31.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,and also where reaction kinetics is temperature dependent you want to couple equations for chemical
Dialogue: 0,00:03:31.320,00:03:39.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,and reaction with thermal equations. So there can be more than one of this that are combined and a lot
Dialogue: 0,00:03:39.800,00:03:47.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,of this commonly understood multiphysics couplings are already built in into a console and a lot of the
Dialogue: 0,00:03:47.960,00:03:49.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,problems that you might be interested in solving are already built in. I hope much of this will be
Dialogue: 0,00:03:49.880,00:03:50.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,understood by the next lecture. Thank you.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:53.960,00:03:59.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,One day you did the micro-remister beam example. This is what me and did.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:00.840,00:04:06.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,It transfer electrical and I think structural mechanics and the couplings you needed there
Dialogue: 0,00:04:06.520,00:04:11.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,were already built in so you just needed to click and add them and console would add the
Dialogue: 0,00:04:11.640,00:04:16.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,necessary equation. But when you are doing research, when you are doing development,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:16.200,00:04:23.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,often the equations you are interested in solving may not be part of what is built in
Dialogue: 0,00:04:23.080,00:04:23.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,or maybe part of the solution. So I think that's a good question.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:23.640,00:04:28.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Maybe part of it is built in but there is a missing part. Maybe you are doing a structural
Dialogue: 0,00:04:28.760,00:04:35.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,mechanics problem where the material behavior has a certain evolution law and that material
Dialogue: 0,00:04:35.240,00:04:40.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,evolution law is not built in but structural mechanics in general is built in. So then what
Dialogue: 0,00:04:40.280,00:04:47.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,you can do is just add your evolution equation as a PDE and couple it with the existing physics-based
Dialogue: 0,00:04:47.480,00:04:52.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,interface. That is how most of our users do work when they
Dialogue: 0,00:04:54.120,00:04:58.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,use equation-based modeling. It's rare that people will do everything from scratch using
Dialogue: 0,00:04:58.920,00:05:04.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,equation-based modeling but obviously you don't want to reinvent the wheel. Part of it is already
Dialogue: 0,00:05:04.360,00:05:10.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,there and the part that's missing you can add using user-defined equations. So
Dialogue: 0,00:05:11.080,00:05:17.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,user-defined equations you use them when what you're interested in solving is not
Dialogue: 0,00:05:18.440,00:05:22.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,in there or sometimes you're actually just curious to work directly with the equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:23.640,00:05:29.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Other times maybe you are a professor and if you are a grad student then just give it to them and
Dialogue: 0,00:05:29.880,00:05:37.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,they should make it for you. But in any case we'll be talking about how then to implement your own
Dialogue: 0,00:05:37.560,00:05:49.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,equations in Comsol. So the way it works is there are multiple templates for entering the equations
Dialogue: 0,00:05:50.280,00:05:53.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,for ODEs, for PDEs and there are more than one ways.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:53.640,00:05:58.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the first way is to use the equation-based model. So you can use the equation-based model
Dialogue: 0,00:05:58.120,00:06:04.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,to enter PDEs. We'll talk about them. But the biggest thing is that you don't need to write
Dialogue: 0,00:06:04.520,00:06:12.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,subroutines or anything like that. You just write your PDEs directly and that makes it faster for
Dialogue: 0,00:06:12.600,00:06:18.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,you to try out different ideas when you're going well maybe the equation behaves this way. Maybe
Dialogue: 0,00:06:18.600,00:06:21.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,there is this term I want to keep or maybe there's this other term I don't want to give.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:21.640,00:06:28.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,So whenever you do that if you can directly prescribe your equations it makes it easy.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:28.600,00:06:34.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,And these equations can be nonlinear, linear, transient or stationary. You don't have to
Dialogue: 0,00:06:36.040,00:06:42.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,worry about that. Of course since you are taking a take a numerical analysis class you won't worry
Dialogue: 0,00:06:42.280,00:06:49.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,about that. But in a more when you're using software to solve physical problems to solve to
Dialogue: 0,00:06:49.880,00:06:50.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,develop a device.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:51.640,00:06:58.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the first thing that you want to do is quickly test your ideas. And then of course later on you
Dialogue: 0,00:06:58.280,00:07:06.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,can tweak once you have made the major decisions about your physics. So the way we will go about it
Dialogue: 0,00:07:06.120,00:07:13.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,today is we'll talk about the mathematics interface first. Then I will focus on partial differential
Dialogue: 0,00:07:13.080,00:07:17.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,equations, how to prescribe partial differential equations and boundary conditions when you are
Dialogue: 0,00:07:17.480,00:07:19.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,using equation-based modeling.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:19.480,00:07:24.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is a very simple process. We will start with the first one. So we will start with the
Dialogue: 0,00:07:24.920,00:07:33.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,differential and algebraic equations. Then we will do a demonstration of a thermal curing problem.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:33.080,00:07:39.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is a heat transfer problem with a slightly non-standard material evolution law. So the way we
Dialogue: 0,00:07:39.800,00:07:46.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,would normally solve this console is use the built-in equation the built-in heat transfer
Dialogue: 0,00:07:46.200,00:07:47.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,interface for the heat transfer part.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:47.880,00:07:58.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we will start with the thermal curing and couple them. But today for the for medical reasons what we will do is we'll do all of it using equation-based modeling.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:02.520,00:08:09.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,We'll talk a little bit about what happens when you're working with axisymmetric components.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:11.240,00:08:17.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,We'll talk a little bit about integral equations. We'll talk about verification.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:17.880,00:08:26.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And validation when you are using any of the built-in physics-based interfaces such as heat transfer
Dialogue: 0,00:08:26.760,00:08:35.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,or structural mechanics or microfluidics or pipe flow in console. And this is true about other
Dialogue: 0,00:08:36.280,00:08:44.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,packages as well. They would have done a verification of the fact that they have implemented
Dialogue: 0,00:08:44.520,00:08:47.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,the right equation and whether it fits.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:47.880,00:08:54.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,If weather works correctly by comparing it with either analytical solutions or experimental data.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:54.760,00:09:00.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now you are putting your own equations and you don't have anything like that to rely on the
Dialogue: 0,00:09:00.760,00:09:07.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,veracity of your equations. So we want to talk about how is it that then you can test
Dialogue: 0,00:09:08.440,00:09:14.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,you are doing the right thing. You are solving the equation correctly.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:16.040,00:09:17.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,And finally we'll go to the next slide.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:17.880,00:09:23.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I will give you homework. Your professor wanted us to give you homework so we'll do that.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:26.200,00:09:32.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,I will be asking you questions along the way and feel free to ask me any questions.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:33.560,00:09:39.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Don't wait until the end if anything in this whole conversation just stopped me and asked.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:39.960,00:09:46.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,I have a couple of hats that I will give away either for good answers or really good questions.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:46.760,00:09:47.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I'll let you decide.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:47.880,00:09:53.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any questions so far?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:54.920,00:09:57.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Asking if you can get the hats isn't a good question.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:58.360,00:09:59.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,Any other questions is legit.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:01.160,00:10:01.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:03.160,00:10:07.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's start with how console deals with this.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:08.280,00:10:12.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,When you, you have seen this Monday when you start a new problem.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:13.560,00:10:17.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,You have to select the physics after you have specified your special dimension with everything.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:17.880,00:10:21.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,3D, 2D, 1D, or 2D over 1D axis and metric.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:22.200,00:10:23.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,You select the physics.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:23.960,00:10:32.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,And here you see the ACDC, which are different interfaces for electrical and magnetics,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:32.040,00:10:37.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,electromagnetic in general, or the fluid flow, heat transfer, semiconductor structural mechanics.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:37.640,00:10:41.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,And at the end there is this node mathematics.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:41.240,00:10:47.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that is where you go when you want to add your own equations rather than using the built-in
Dialogue: 0,00:10:47.880,00:10:48.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,interfaces.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:48.680,00:10:57.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now when you go to the mathematics interface, then there are choices within it.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:57.160,00:11:05.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you could be specifying PDs, you could be specifying ODEs, you could be doing optimization
Dialogue: 0,00:11:05.000,00:11:06.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,and sensitivity analysis.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:06.760,00:11:11.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,We have this classical PDs branch.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:11.160,00:11:15.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,That is really a replica of the PD interfaces.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:15.800,00:11:16.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,But things like this.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:16.760,00:11:17.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then you have the other interfaces.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:17.800,00:11:22.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Things like Laplace equation, Poisson equation, Helmholtz equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:22.040,00:11:23.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,People often use them.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:23.560,00:11:28.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we want sort of a prepackaged option for those.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:28.680,00:11:31.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that's what you get under classical PDs.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:31.240,00:11:38.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you are solving a problem with a moving domain or with a moving interface, we have
Dialogue: 0,00:11:38.520,00:11:44.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,a mathematical level set and phase field interfaces that you can use.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:44.200,00:11:47.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for example, if you're having a heat transfer problem with space change.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:47.800,00:11:52.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,We already have a heat transfer with space change interface built in.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:52.040,00:11:57.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,But this is when you are adding your own phase field or level set type mathematics.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:57.960,00:12:06.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then the form branch for solving problems on moving domains and other interfaces.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:06.760,00:12:12.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what we will be talking about today is what we get in the PD interfaces and in the
Dialogue: 0,00:12:12.760,00:12:14.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,OE and DA interfaces.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:14.520,00:12:17.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,And as you see there in the PD interfaces.
Dialogue: 0,00:12:17.160,00:12:23.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,You have a couple of different options to specify your PDs.
