Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:03.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So once we have these weak forms, we can
Dialogue: 0,00:00:03.840,00:00:08.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,discretize our domain and restrict the
Dialogue: 0,00:00:08.700,00:00:11.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,H1 space into a finite dimensional space,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:11.680,00:00:16.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,a subset of all possible H1 functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:16.020,00:00:23.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,So here let's go to MATLAB and click my window.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:23.280,00:00:29.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's generate a mesh. So I'm going to
Dialogue: 0,00:00:29.700,00:00:34.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,launch PDToolbox. So what I can draw is
Dialogue: 0,00:00:34.320,00:00:40.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,an arbitrary polygon, I guess. You can
Dialogue: 0,00:00:40.800,00:00:42.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,make any shape you want.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:42.460,00:00:46.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so I have a domain like that. I can
Dialogue: 0,00:00:46.920,00:00:52.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,mesh it. So I get a mesh and I can, in the
Dialogue: 0,00:00:52.680,00:00:56.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,mesh menu, I can export the mesh into the
Dialogue: 0,00:00:56.700,00:00:58.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,MATLAB workspace.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:58.860,00:00:59.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:59.360,00:00:59.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to export this mesh into the MATLAB workspace.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:59.660,00:00:59.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to export this mesh into the MATLAB workspace.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:59.680,00:01:05.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what I get is three variables, E, P, and T.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:05.400,00:01:09.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,P is a two-dimensional, it just contains
Dialogue: 0,00:01:09.860,00:01:12.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,the X as the first row and Y as the
Dialogue: 0,00:01:12.800,00:01:17.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,second row. And T contains, the first
Dialogue: 0,00:01:17.780,00:01:20.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,three rows of T contains the indices in
Dialogue: 0,00:01:20.740,00:01:24.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,P of the three vertices of each triangle
Dialogue: 0,00:01:24.300,00:01:28.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,element. The final row is the index of
Dialogue: 0,00:01:28.500,00:01:29.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,the domain, so you can make a
Dialogue: 0,00:01:29.640,00:01:31.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,multiple domains. In this case I only
Dialogue: 0,00:01:31.280,00:01:33.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,have one domain, so it's all of them are
Dialogue: 0,00:01:33.460,00:01:37.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,one. E is pretty complex, but we won't use
Dialogue: 0,00:01:37.900,00:01:41.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,this at all. So we are going to
Dialogue: 0,00:01:41.140,00:01:44.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,only use the first two rows of E. So E is
Dialogue: 0,00:01:44.560,00:01:47.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,not all the edges, it contains only the
Dialogue: 0,00:01:47.820,00:01:51.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,outside boundary edges. Okay. So we are
Dialogue: 0,00:01:51.820,00:01:53.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,going to only use E to identify which
Dialogue: 0,00:01:53.840,00:01:58.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,points lie on the boundary. Okay, so
Dialogue: 0,00:01:58.060,00:01:59.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,for example, let's look at the boundary edges.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:59.300,00:02:04.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Let's figure this out for now. So I at
Dialogue: 0,00:02:04.040,00:02:06.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,the boundary is simply equal to the
Dialogue: 0,00:02:06.760,00:02:13.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,unique points in the first row of E and
Dialogue: 0,00:02:13.040,00:02:18.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,the second row of E. So these are IB,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:18.060,00:02:21.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,it turns out there are 70 points,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:21.800,00:02:26.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,there are exactly 70 points on the
Dialogue: 0,00:02:26.180,00:02:28.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,boundary, which makes sense. There are 70 points.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:29.300,00:02:32.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you look at the dimension of E,
Dialogue: 0,00:02:32.660,00:02:36.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,there are 70 edges. So because it's
Dialogue: 0,00:02:36.740,00:02:38.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,two dimensional domain, the number of edges
Dialogue: 0,00:02:38.460,00:02:40.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,on the boundary is the same as the
Dialogue: 0,00:02:40.060,00:02:42.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,number of points on the boundary. Alright.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:42.400,00:02:48.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what's next? Let's visualize the mesh.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:48.060,00:02:51.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,So MATLAB there is a tryMesh function
Dialogue: 0,00:02:51.500,00:02:55.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the first argument of tryMesh should
Dialogue: 0,00:02:55.280,00:02:57.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,be the triangles, which I can take the
Dialogue: 0,00:02:57.380,00:02:59.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,first three
Dialogue: 0,00:02:59.300,00:03:02.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,rows of T. And MATLAB actually needs
Dialogue: 0,00:03:02.660,00:03:05.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,is, sorry, it needs is transpose. So it needs a
Dialogue: 0,00:03:05.240,00:03:11.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,n by 3 matrix as the triangles and
Dialogue: 0,00:03:11.300,00:03:13.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,the three are just the indices of the
Dialogue: 0,00:03:13.060,00:03:19.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,points. And the x dimension of P is P1
Dialogue: 0,00:03:19.400,00:03:25.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,and the y dimension is P2. So that gives me
Dialogue: 0,00:03:25.820,00:03:27.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,da da da da.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:27.800,00:03:28.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,I think I have it.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:29.300,00:03:31.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,I have an actual parenthesis. So that
Dialogue: 0,00:03:31.520,00:03:38.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,gives me a mesh. Close. Right. So that's
Dialogue: 0,00:03:38.660,00:03:41.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,that's a visualization of the mesh we
Dialogue: 0,00:03:41.040,00:03:45.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,just made. Right. So when we are talking
Dialogue: 0,00:03:45.560,00:03:48.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,about finding element, we're going to be
Dialogue: 0,00:03:48.560,00:03:52.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,defining in this lecture a piecewise
Dialogue: 0,00:03:52.180,00:03:56.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,linear function that is piecewise linear
Dialogue: 0,00:03:56.480,00:03:58.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,in each of these small triangles.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:59.300,00:04:02.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,And to, also we are going to enforce
Dialogue: 0,00:04:02.180,00:04:07.580,辉英,,0,0,0,,these functions to be continuous. So can
Dialogue: 0,00:04:07.580,00:04:09.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,you visualize what a piecewise linear
Dialogue: 0,00:04:09.740,00:04:12.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,and continuous function should look like
Dialogue: 0,00:04:12.220,00:04:16.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,in such a domain? A linear function on
Dialogue: 0,00:04:16.960,00:04:22.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,the triangle is just a flat but slanted
Dialogue: 0,00:04:22.460,00:04:25.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,function. If you think of the value of
Dialogue: 0,00:04:25.560,00:04:27.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,the function in the other space. Let's,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:27.620,00:04:28.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,for example, let's map out and say we are going
Dialogue: 0,00:04:28.520,00:04:38.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,let's make one. So let's say u is going to be zeros, the number of points is 406,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:38.240,00:04:55.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,and let's make a random u to be 1. Okay, I'm just making a function that is equal to 0 on all grid
Dialogue: 0,00:04:55.560,00:04:59.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,points except for one grid points. And let's visualize what this function looks like.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:59.980,00:05:04.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm going to try mesh the function, but with another variable u here.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:06.900,00:05:14.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is how the function looks like. It's a function that is piecewise linear because,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:14.740,00:05:19.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,I mean, because it's on every, on all the flat surfaces, it's piecewise linear for sure because
Dialogue: 0,00:05:19.960,00:05:25.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's zero. And on this, on the size of these particular points,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:25.560,00:05:33.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,they are also piecewise linear, right? Because each element is a triangle, and if you define
Dialogue: 0,00:05:33.700,00:05:38.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,the three values at the three vertices, you get a linear function, you get a unique linear function.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:39.680,00:05:42.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is one of the basis functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:44.760,00:05:50.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,And I think you can also do a choice serve that may make it a little bit more clear,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:50.220,00:05:52.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,right? So that gives you,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:52.840,00:05:54.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,that gives you,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:54.900,00:05:55.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,that gives you,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:55.540,00:05:57.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,that gives you a continuous surface.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:57.240,00:05:58.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,I should have, oh,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:01.360,00:06:03.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,let me, let me do that again.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:07.380,00:06:09.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's rotate, yeah, rotate 3D.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:09.880,00:06:16.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, so you can see it's, it's going to be a function that is continuous everywhere and piecewise linear.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:17.380,00:06:17.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:18.600,00:06:24.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we can do this for as many times as there are interior grid points.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:25.540,00:06:28.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right? Because if I have the boundary values to be zero,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:28.840,00:06:32.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,I don't need the boundary grid points to contribute to the basis functions.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:32.980,00:06:35.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,They are all zero.
