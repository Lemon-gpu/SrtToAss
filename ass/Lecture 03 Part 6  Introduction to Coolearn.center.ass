Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:04.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is a previous project done in Virginia Tech, so in another university.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:05.400,00:00:12.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,So basically, you have a code that is going to evaluate your solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:13.680,00:00:16.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,So you can look at the project description over here.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:16.860,00:00:18.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is a demo project.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:18.440,00:00:21.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,Please write a function with a function name, computer lab 5.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:22.280,00:00:29.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,So whatever you write, the function name should be the same as what the project name is,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:29.720,00:00:31.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,which in this case is computer lab 5.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:32.940,00:00:37.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,And you can see that this code calls the computer lab 5, which is the function you wrote.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:39.580,00:00:42.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,And then it assesses the result.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:42.740,00:00:50.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,If it's not equal to, this is a dummy case, if it is not 256, it tells you your solution is wrong, otherwise it's right.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:50.380,00:00:58.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for example, you can come into the room, you can say code up takes one x,
Dialogue: 0,00:00:58.560,00:00:59.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,and you say, okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:59.720,00:01:04.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,My result, you need to say result is equal to computer lab 5.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:04.840,00:01:08.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the syntax is the same as what you would do in MATLAB.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:09.280,00:01:10.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,Say 256.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:11.740,00:01:13.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,Somebody is also, okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:14.580,00:01:17.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then you can run it.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:17.220,00:01:18.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,It says your answer is right.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:18.740,00:01:24.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,So I see a lot of people are in the room, so can you just change the result to something else and run it?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:24.360,00:01:24.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:26.940,00:01:29.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,T-plant.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:29.720,00:01:31.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, 25.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:32.040,00:01:34.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,And yeah, it says your result is wrong.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:34.200,00:01:38.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,So click this one to look at the result.
