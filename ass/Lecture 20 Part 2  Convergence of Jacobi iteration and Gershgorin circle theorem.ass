Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.760,00:00:05.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,We are often asking a question, when does the Jacobi iteration converge?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:05.320,00:00:07.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,When does it not converge?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:07.940,00:00:15.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,And it is very hard to figure out a necessary condition for the convergence.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:15.440,00:00:19.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's very hard to figure out a sufficient and necessary condition for the convergence.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:19.960,00:00:26.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,But there are sufficient conditions for the convergence of Jacobi iteration, which means
Dialogue: 0,00:00:26.320,00:00:30.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,there are some conditions you can check, and if it satisfies this condition, then you know
Dialogue: 0,00:00:30.880,00:00:33.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Jacobi iteration is going to converge.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:33.640,00:00:40.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,So for example, one of the methods to check the convergence of a Jacobi iteration is called
Dialogue: 0,00:00:40.080,00:00:48.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,a diagonal dominance.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:48.700,00:00:51.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,What does diagonal dominance mean?
Dialogue: 0,00:00:51.660,00:00:54.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you have a matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:54.340,00:00:56.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,The diagonal entries.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:56.300,00:01:04.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Of A, of this matrix A. A , A , etc. to A .
Dialogue: 0,00:01:04.000,00:01:12.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,The absolute values of the diagonal entries, if they are larger than the sum of the absolute
Dialogue: 0,00:01:12.300,00:01:16.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,values of all of its off-diagonals.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:16.180,00:01:24.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay so let's say A, the off-diagonals, I will just use another color to denote it.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:26.300,00:01:30.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,A , A , etc.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:30.620,00:01:41.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if the absolute value of A for any k is greater than the summation of I not equal
Dialogue: 0,00:01:41.320,00:01:47.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,to k of A absolute value.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:47.680,00:01:50.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is called diagonal dominance.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:50.100,00:01:53.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,Actually this is called strict diagonal dominance.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:53.600,00:01:56.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you have greater or equal.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:56.000,00:01:57.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,A non-strict diagonal dominance.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:57.560,00:02:06.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,Remember for our Poisson's equation, do we have strict diagonal dominance?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:06.460,00:02:13.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,No, but we have the weaker non-strict diagonal dominance, right, because the diagonals are
Dialogue: 0,00:02:13.620,00:02:18.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,minus two and the off-diagonals, we have two off-diagonals, both one and one.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:18.960,00:02:22.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,In the 2D Poisson's equation the diagonal is minus four.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:22.260,00:02:24.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,The off-diagonals, we have four ones.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:24.120,00:02:25.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,In 3D, the diagonal is minus one.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:25.000,00:02:25.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:25.840,00:02:31.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,the diagonal would be minus 6 and we have 6 off-diagonals. And if you remember
Dialogue: 0,00:02:31.780,00:02:36.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,our finite element case when we solve the Poisson's equation, we also have a
Dialogue: 0,00:02:36.340,00:02:47.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,non-strict version of diagonal dominance. Alright, so if a matrix is diagonally
Dialogue: 0,00:02:47.500,00:02:54.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,dominant, we know that Jacobi iteration converges. So how do we know that? We need
Dialogue: 0,00:02:54.640,00:03:05.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,use a theorem called theêug Positive circle theorem. So what
Dialogue: 0,00:03:05.620,00:03:15.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,does that mean? It means the eigenvalues of a matrix, so the lambda k of a matrix
Dialogue: 0,00:03:15.520,00:03:22.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,are the lambda k has to lie in at least the one of the so
Dialogue: 0,00:03:22.780,00:03:24.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,called a digestible
Dialogue: 0,00:03:24.600,00:03:24.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,matrix. So every ment realtà pose uma esn da equação blindada...
Dialogue: 0,00:03:24.640,00:03:42.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,circle. So every lambda k must be within a circle that is defined as all the lambdas,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:42.040,00:04:04.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,such that lambda minus one of the diagonals is less or equal to the summation of the i not equal to k, a, i, or a, k, i.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:06.700,00:04:09.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in the complex plane, this is a circle.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:09.360,00:04:21.480,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's a circle centered at a, k, k with a diameter of the summation of the absolute value of the diagonal entries.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:23.060,00:04:32.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, that means all the eigenvalues have to lie in the union of all the Gershgorin circles.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:33.500,00:04:37.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,And each Gershgorin circle corresponds to one row of the matrix.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:39.360,00:04:41.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,So why is that the case?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:41.740,00:04:55.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's the case because if we have a eigenvalue, let me say a times vk equal to lambda k times vk.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:57.180,00:05:02.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so if that is the case, let's pick.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:06.440,00:05:09.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So, okay, so let's actually use j here.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:09.360,00:05:10.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Instead of k.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:11.420,00:05:16.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So a times vj is equal to lambda j times vj.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:16.320,00:05:34.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,So let's pick k such that vkj, so the kth entry of the vector vj, has greatest magnitude.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:37.140,00:05:38.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:38.280,00:05:38.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,Which means vkj.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:39.360,00:05:48.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,vkj is greater than vij for any i not equal to k.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:48.620,00:05:49.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,All right, greater or equal.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:50.240,00:05:51.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,So why is this helpful?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:52.240,00:05:55.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's helpful because we can write this equality.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:56.120,00:06:07.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,We can write the specific line of that equality as the summation of that particular line of the matrix,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:07.320,00:06:09.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,which is a.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:09.360,00:06:21.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So vkj times vij would be equal to the corresponding line of the right-hand side, which is lambda j times what?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:24.680,00:06:29.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,What is the corresponding row of lambda j times vj?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:30.980,00:06:33.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,If I choose the kth row.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:33.240,00:06:33.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,Vkj.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:37.040,00:06:38.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah, vkj, right.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:39.360,00:06:40.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Great.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:41.220,00:06:49.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now let's try to move all the vkj's to one side and all the non-vkj's to the other side.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:49.160,00:07:07.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,What we get is akk times vkj minus lambda j times vkj would be equal to the minus of the summation of all the i not equal to j of aki times vij.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:07.940,00:07:08.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:08.080,00:07:08.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.

Dialogue: 0,00:07:42.580,00:07:47.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, by the way, I have moved the absolute value from outside the summation to inside the summation.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:48.000,00:07:50.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,Therefore, we have a less or equal to sign.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:50.380,00:07:54.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,So we have a less or equal because just moving the absolute value to here.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:56.600,00:07:57.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,Vkj.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:58.020,00:08:02.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,And also we know this is strictly less or equal to 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:02.760,00:08:08.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because we have chosen Vkj to be the largest among all the Vij's.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:08.740,00:08:11.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this again is going to be a summation.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:11.300,00:08:13.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,Oh, here we also have absolute value.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:13.660,00:08:18.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,Summation i not equal to k, absolute value of aki.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:19.720,00:08:20.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:20.500,00:08:22.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,So here we prove the Gershgorian theorem.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:23.120,00:08:26.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Basically, all the eigenvalues have to lie in one of these circles.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:26.880,00:08:33.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,And fortunately, for a diagonally dominant matrix, the Jacobi iteration matrix,
Dialogue: 0,00:08:35.420,00:08:38.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,has Gershgorian theorem.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:38.740,00:08:48.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,It has Gershgorian's circles that are very friendly to us.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:48.280,00:09:01.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,In the sense that the minus D inverse times L plus U would be equal to a matrix that is minus 0 on the diagonal.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:01.500,00:09:05.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because we already removed the diagonal, we are looking at L plus U.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:05.420,00:09:08.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,And all the diagonal entries are, for example,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:08.540,00:09:14.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,a12 divided by a11, a13 divided by a11, etc.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:14.300,00:09:20.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the Gershgorian circles are centered at 0 because all the akks are 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:20.300,00:09:20.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:20.800,00:09:25.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if you look at the complex plane, all the circles are centered at 0.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:25.960,00:09:28.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,How about the diameters?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:28.960,00:09:34.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,The diameters are the summation of the absolute value of all these diagonal entries.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:34.180,00:09:37.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we know that if we are diagonally dominant,
Dialogue: 0,00:09:37.380,00:09:38.120,辉英,,0,0,0,,the a11 is the absolute value of all these diagonal entries.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:38.120,00:09:38.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we know that if we are diagonally dominant, the a11 is the absolute value of all these diagonal entries.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:38.520,00:09:39.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we know that if we are diagonally dominant, the a11 is the absolute value of all these diagonal entries.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:39.060,00:09:45.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this A1 would be greater than the summation of all the absolute values of the diagonal entries.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:45.460,00:09:51.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the diameter, which is the summation of all these absolute values, would be less than what?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:51.520,00:09:53.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the diameter, which is the summation of all these absolute values, would be less than what?
Dialogue: 0,00:09:53.940,00:09:54.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,1.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:54.800,00:09:55.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:55.800,00:10:00.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,So all the Gershgorian circles would be centered at around 0 with various diameters,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:00.300,00:10:01.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,but all of them are less than 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:01.560,00:10:02.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,What does that mean in terms of the eigenvalues of the Jacobi iteration matrix?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:02.940,00:10:03.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is not the answer.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:03.940,00:10:05.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,There are 4 different argumentations.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:05.140,00:10:06.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,But there are 4 different arguments about the force of these numbers.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:06.460,00:10:07.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is a very complex problem.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:07.460,00:10:07.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,Very lost argument.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:07.880,00:10:08.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Thank you very much.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:08.520,00:10:18.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,they have to lie on a circle that has to be strictly within the stability region, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:10:18.240,00:10:24.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,So basically all the eigenvalues have to have its magnitude less than 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:27.240,00:10:32.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Therefore, for diagonally dominant matrices, we are guaranteed to converge.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:32.680,00:10:47.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,And we can also have a similar argument of saying that for non-strictly diagonally dominant matrices like the Poisson's equation,
Dialogue: 0,00:10:48.360,00:10:58.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,we would have some Gershgorian circles that are exactly having a radius of 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:00.280,00:11:00.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:00.960,00:11:06.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So then what we know is all the eigenvalues of the Jacobi iteration matrix,
Dialogue: 0,00:11:06.040,00:11:09.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,they cannot have magnitude greater than 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:09.720,00:11:12.800,辉英,,0,0,0,,But they can potentially have magnitude equal to 1.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:13.200,00:11:20.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,That means you may have some moles that are never decaying, but like you shouldn't diverge.
Dialogue: 0,00:11:20.720,00:11:22.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,Your Jacobi iteration
Dialogue: 0,00:11:23.800,00:11:25.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,could be
Dialogue: 0,00:11:25.240,00:11:30.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,basically the error equation, in the error equation, the error could be constant.
