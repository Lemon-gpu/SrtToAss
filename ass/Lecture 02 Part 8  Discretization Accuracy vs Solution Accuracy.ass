Dialogue: 0,00:00:00.000,00:00:06.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, we already discussed the truncation error in finite difference.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:06.380,00:00:16.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the truncation error is how much error we are making in approximating all the differential operators in the equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:16.100,00:00:22.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,So in our previous case, we did two equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:22.600,00:00:31.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's equal to kappa times pi square u pi square x square.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:33.420,00:00:42.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the truncation error, because we are not approximating the time derivative term, we're just treating it as OD, we are only converting from PD to OD.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:43.240,00:00:46.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,The truncation error in that process of truncation error is how much error we are making in finite difference.
Dialogue: 0,00:00:46.080,00:01:04.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the conversion is defined as ui plus 1 plus ui minus 1 minus 2ui divided by delta x minus, we also have a kappa, minus pi square u pi square x square.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:04.880,00:01:05.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:05.540,00:01:06.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's the truncation error.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:07.980,00:01:11.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the error in approximating the PDE.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:11.540,00:01:14.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,It is not the error in the solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:16.080,00:01:18.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,What do I mean by the error in the solution?
Dialogue: 0,00:01:19.520,00:01:24.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,The error in the solution is the difference, as I call it, e.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:25.800,00:01:27.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,That's the error in the solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:28.320,00:01:39.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,It is the difference between the ui you get minus u at i delta x analytic.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:42.180,00:01:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,The word analytic.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:46.080,00:01:53.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,A total error in the solution is known as a total time error.
Dialogue: 0,00:01:53.080,00:02:05.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,The relative expression is used a lot because when we compare a numerical solution with an analytic solution, for example the straight line, we know at the end of the evaluation, we use u analytic as the real solution, the actual solution, the exact solution, so some people also use the exact here.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:05.820,00:02:09.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,And.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:09.460,00:02:13.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,In your project you also are going to derive an analytic solution before you even start coding.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:13.560,00:02:14.660,辉英,,0,0,0,,But in a lot of cases, there is a constant of time, that's the result is also given to the solution owner.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:14.660,00:02:15.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's a function function as a function again.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:15.040,00:02:15.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:02:15.200,00:02:15.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:15.520,00:02:15.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,Eat it.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:15.780,00:02:15.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:15.840,00:02:16.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,literally keep telling me to do it Triangle.
Dialogue: 0,00:02:16.020,00:02:23.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,is no analytic solutions to start with so we may also think of that as a exact
Dialogue: 0,00:02:23.980,00:02:31.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,solution some solution that you can't really derive but it's still there is
Dialogue: 0,00:02:31.280,00:02:35.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,the exact solution of the partial differential equation so now the
Dialogue: 0,00:02:35.960,00:02:39.880,辉英,,0,0,0,,solution error is what's the difference between the numerical solution and the
Dialogue: 0,00:02:39.880,00:02:47.760,辉英,,0,0,0,,exact solution and this is different from the truncation error it can be
Dialogue: 0,00:02:47.760,00:03:05.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,quite different okay and it is different because of this so if you solve if you
Dialogue: 0,00:03:05.680,00:03:09.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,solve the equation in two ways right if you write down
Dialogue: 0,00:03:09.840,00:03:09.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,a
Dialogue: 0,00:03:09.880,00:03:14.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,the differential equation for the analytic one, this is actually, let me just write it as A,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:15.280,00:03:18.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,this is the equation satisfied by the analytic solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:19.960,00:03:26.720,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the actual numerical solution satisfies a different equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:27.500,00:03:31.640,辉英,,0,0,0,,It satisfies, let me use hat to denote the numerical solution,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:31.960,00:03:34.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,to distinguish from the analytical solution.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:34.300,00:03:40.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's equal to kappa times the finite difference operator,
Dialogue: 0,00:03:40.740,00:03:48.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,or the discretized operator.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:49.080,00:03:53.700,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the equation satisfied by these two different equations.
Dialogue: 0,00:03:58.260,00:03:59.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:00.060,00:04:02.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,Now, if you subtract,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:03.180,00:04:04.280,辉英,,0,0,0,,the right-hand side,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:04.280,00:04:06.400,辉英,,0,0,0,,the left-hand side equation from the left-hand side equation,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:07.040,00:04:08.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,what do you get?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:15.080,00:04:17.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you do that subtraction,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:18.160,00:04:19.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,what you get is,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:20.460,00:04:28.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,the left-hand side is the derivative of u hat minus the derivative of u analytic.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:30.140,00:04:33.300,辉英,,0,0,0,,Or, if you collect this derivative,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:33.300,00:04:34.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's actually,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:34.280,00:04:36.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,it's actually partial e, partial t.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:38.640,00:04:39.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:04:41.360,00:04:41.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:04:42.440,00:04:51.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,And now, the right-hand side is different by kappa times ui plus 1 hat,
Dialogue: 0,00:04:54.000,00:04:59.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,plus ui minus 1 hat, minus 2 ui hat,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:00.400,00:05:01.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,divided by,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:04.280,00:05:04.780,辉英,,0,0,0,,uh,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:10.960,00:05:12.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,delta x squared,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:12.400,00:05:17.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,minus partial squared ua partial x squared.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:25.240,00:05:25.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay.
Dialogue: 0,00:05:26.980,00:05:28.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this term,
Dialogue: 0,00:05:28.860,00:05:30.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,is it the truncation error?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:33.180,00:05:33.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is it?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:34.280,00:05:42.840,辉英,,0,0,0,,So can somebody see the difference between the right-hand side of this equation and the
Dialogue: 0,00:05:42.840,00:05:54.460,辉英,,0,0,0,,truncation error?
Dialogue: 0,00:05:54.460,00:06:00.020,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if the right-hand side is just the truncation error, that's great, because I know that if
Dialogue: 0,00:06:00.020,00:06:08.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,the truncation error first of all is small, then the solution error just grows by a rate
Dialogue: 0,00:06:08.500,00:06:12.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,that is defined by the truncation error.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:12.160,00:06:17.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,So if the truncation error is going to be bounded, for example, by 10 to the minus 5,
Dialogue: 0,00:06:17.500,00:06:22.960,辉英,,0,0,0,,then my solution error is going to be bounded by 10 to the minus 5 times t, which as long
Dialogue: 0,00:06:22.960,00:06:27.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,as t is not huge, I'm happy.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:27.420,00:06:30.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,But unfortunately, it doesn't work like that.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:30.000,00:06:36.440,辉英,,0,0,0,,If you look at the right-hand side, what's the difference between this and tau?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:36.440,00:06:38.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Is this equal to tau?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:38.240,00:06:39.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Yes?
Dialogue: 0,00:06:39.240,00:06:47.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well, there's a ua there instead of just u.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:47.000,00:06:48.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,Exactly.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:48.320,00:06:52.680,辉英,,0,0,0,,There is a ua here instead of u.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:52.680,00:06:59.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,The truncation error is defined by plugging the same u, the same solution, to two u's.
Dialogue: 0,00:06:59.980,00:07:05.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,So there's two different operators, one analytic, one numeric.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:05.220,00:07:11.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,Well, the right-hand side of this error equation is by plugging two different solutions into
Dialogue: 0,00:07:11.140,00:07:13.140,辉英,,0,0,0,,two different operators.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:13.140,00:07:17.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,It's plugging the numerical solution into the numerical operator, and the analytic solution
Dialogue: 0,00:07:17.100,00:07:19.220,辉英,,0,0,0,,into the analytic operator.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:19.220,00:07:25.920,辉英,,0,0,0,,Okay, so there is one step between this and tau, and that is the step that can mess up
Dialogue: 0,00:07:25.920,00:07:28.380,辉英,,0,0,0,,a lot of things if you are not careful.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:28.380,00:07:32.940,辉英,,0,0,0,,And that's what makes things like stability very important.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:32.940,00:07:35.260,辉英,,0,0,0,,So that step is the following.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:35.260,00:07:44.820,辉英,,0,0,0,,First of all, I want to look at, I want to basically make the truncation error, I want
Dialogue: 0,00:07:44.820,00:07:49.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,to construct, I want to manufacture a truncation error in this.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:49.500,00:07:55.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,So what I'm going to do is I'm going to minus a ui plus 1 analytic.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:55.620,00:07:57.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,Plus, sorry.
Dialogue: 0,00:07:57.620,00:08:05.500,辉英,,0,0,0,,Plus ui minus 1 analytic, minus 2 ui analytic here.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:05.500,00:08:07.520,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is manufactured.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:07.520,00:08:11.360,辉英,,0,0,0,,Then plus the same thing.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:11.360,00:08:18.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm subtracting and adding the same thing, which is basically doing nothing, making the
Dialogue: 0,00:08:18.320,00:08:23.180,辉英,,0,0,0,,equation still hold.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:23.180,00:08:27.340,辉英,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:27.340,00:08:29.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,You see what I'm doing here?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:29.160,00:08:34.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,I'm subtracting this term and I'm adding the same term into the equation.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:34.240,00:08:36.100,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright.
Dialogue: 0,00:08:36.100,00:08:41.200,辉英,,0,0,0,,So now where is the truncation error?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:41.200,00:08:55.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,Do we see something that is actually equal to the truncation error here?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:55.240,00:08:59.240,辉英,,0,0,0,,The second line, right?
Dialogue: 0,00:08:59.240,00:09:09.860,辉英,,0,0,0,,This is now plugging the same analytical solution, both are ua, into two different operators.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:09.860,00:09:12.040,辉英,,0,0,0,,So this is the truncation error.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:12.040,00:09:14.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,But we also have a first term.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:14.900,00:09:23.160,辉英,,0,0,0,,We also have a first term that is actually plugging in two different solutions into the
Dialogue: 0,00:09:23.160,00:09:24.900,辉英,,0,0,0,,same discrete operator.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:24.900,00:09:29.740,辉英,,0,0,0,,And these two different solutions, the difference between them is actually e.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:29.740,00:09:32.980,辉英,,0,0,0,,This u hat minus ua is actually e.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:32.980,00:09:35.420,辉英,,0,0,0,,So the time evolution of the error has two terms.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:35.420,00:09:37.540,辉英,,0,0,0,,One term is the truncation error.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:37.540,00:09:44.000,辉英,,0,0,0,,Another term is plugging in the error itself into the discrete operator.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:44.000,00:09:50.320,辉英,,0,0,0,,And the first term is why stability of the discrete operator is very important.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:50.320,00:09:53.620,辉英,,0,0,0,,Because if the operator is not stable.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:53.620,00:09:54.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,That means even.
Dialogue: 0,00:09:54.560,00:10:00.600,辉英,,0,0,0,,A very slight truncation error is going to be exponentially amplified by the discrete
Dialogue: 0,00:10:00.600,00:10:05.060,辉英,,0,0,0,,operator and your whole solution error becomes huge.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:05.060,00:10:06.560,辉英,,0,0,0,,Your solution becomes garbage.
Dialogue: 0,00:10:06.560,00:10:11.080,辉英,,0,0,0,,Alright, we are going to continue discussing that next lecture.
